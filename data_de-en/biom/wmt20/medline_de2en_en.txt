doc1	1	[Primary obstructive megaureter: a domain of conservative treatment].
doc1	2	The term "megaureter" is an entirely descriptive designation for a number of different entities.
doc1	3	It is crucial to distinguish between primary and secondary forms of megaureter and between obstructive and/or refluxive forms.
doc1	4	In the majority of cases, there is a primary obstruction in the terminal ureterovesical segment.
doc1	5	The treatment of primary obstructive megaureter has changed fundamentally over the last 3 decades.
doc1	6	Whereas ureteral reimplantation was the treatment of choice in the past, conservative treatment is now preferred in 85 to 90 % of patients.
doc1	7	With the advent of endoscopic balloon dilatation, a modern, minimally-invasive treatment option has become an alternative to ureteral reimplantation in selected patients.
doc1	8	However, due to the possibility of postoperative VUR (vesicoureteral reflux), it is necessary to emphasize that this option should not weaken the generally strict indication for surgical treatment of primary obstructive megaureter.
doc10	1	Joint Statement of the German Radiological Society and the German Respiratory Society on a Quality-Assured Early Detection Program for Lung Cancer with Low-Dose CT.
doc10	2	Substantial new data on the early detection of lung cancer with low-dose CT has become available since the last joint statement of the German Radiological Society and the German Respiratory Society was published in 2011.
doc10	3	The German S3 guideline on lung cancer was revised in 2018 and now contains a weak recommendation regarding the early detection of lung cancer with low-dose CT in a quality-assured early detection program.
doc10	4	These new developments required a change in the position of the involved professional societies.
doc10	5	This joint statement describes the main features of a quality-assured program for the early detection of lung cancer with low-dose CT in Germany.
doc10	6	KEY POINTS::   · New study data on early detection of lung cancer with low-dose CT and the new German S3 guideline on lung cancer required a new positioning of the involved professional societies..

doc11	1	First Clinical Experience with Anti-myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody-Positive Optic Neuritis.
doc11	2	BACKGROUND
doc11	3	Antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG-IgG) have been consistently found in a range of demyelinating disorders.
doc11	4	In this context, MOG-IgG-associated optic neuritis (ON) has been suggested as a new subset of optic neuropathy.
doc11	5	However, clinical manifestations and distinctive characteristics have only rarely been described.
doc11	6	PATIENTS AND METHODS
doc11	7	A retrospective case series of three patients with MOG-IgG-associated ON.
doc11	8	Clinical morphological features using imaging techniques are presented.
doc11	9	RESULTS
doc11	10	Three patients (8-year-old boy, 28-year-old female, 48-year-old male) were included.
doc11	11	An 8-year-old boy suffered from a bilateral ON with severe visual loss.
doc11	12	The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.05 in the right eye and finger counting in the left eye.
doc11	13	The patient had a previous episode of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) with a right abducens nerve palsy.
doc11	14	Visual acuity recovered after repeated cycles of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy and 10 cycles of plasma exchange.
doc11	15	During the last follow-up, BCVA was 0.9 in the right eye and 0.8 in the left eye.
doc11	16	A 28-year-old female presented with a bilateral ON.
doc11	17	Her BCVA was 0.5 in the right eye and 0.8 in the left eye.
doc11	18	She fully recovered with pulse methylprednisolone therapy (1000 mg/d) with tapering after the second cycle and had a BCVA of 1.0 during the last follow-up visit.
doc11	19	A 48-year-old male suffered from a relapsing bilateral ON.
doc11	20	At first presentation, BCVA was 0.1 in the right eye and finger counting in the left eye.
doc11	21	BCVA fully recovered after each pulse therapy with intravenous methylprednisolone (two cycles).
doc11	22	Since the first relapse, the patient has been receiving long-term immunosuppression with rituximab.
doc11	23	Despite rituximab and low-dose oral prednisone, the patient had another relapse with a left ON.
doc11	24	After a third cycle with intravenous methylprednisolone, he partially recovered.
doc11	25	BCVA at last follow-up was 1.0 in the right and 0.8 in the left eye.
doc11	26	CONCLUSIONS
doc11	27	MOG-IgG antibodies have been identified in different acquired demyelinating syndromes.
doc11	28	The patients reported had an ADEM followed by bilateral ON, an isolated bilateral ON, and a relapsing bilateral ON.
doc11	29	Individual treatment strategies led to substantial visual recovery in all patients.
doc11	30	We recommend inclusion of MOG-IgG antibodies in the diagnostic workup at least after the first recurrence of ON since they can serve as a diagnostic and potential prognostic tool and might lead to specific therapeutic recommendations.
doc12	1	Design and practical evaluation of a shielded application system for intravenously administered radionuclide therapies.
doc12	2	AIM
doc12	3	Intravenous radionuclide therapies are gaining importance.
doc12	4	With the increased frequency of these therapies, safe application procedures in combination with effective radiation protection are needed.
doc12	5	We present a shielded system which can be universally used for the application of liquid radiopharmaceuticals.
doc12	6	MATERIALS AND METHODS
doc12	7	The application system consists of a cuboidal box made of lead with stainless steel coating, an inner layer of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), a disposable line/bottle system, and a medical infusion pump.
doc12	8	No proprietary disposable parts are used.
doc12	9	The system was tested and validated ex-vivo, and evaluated for Lu-177 peptide receptor radionuclide and for radioligand therapies (PRRT, RLT).
doc12	10	RESULTS
doc12	11	Construction of the application system was performed in accordance with the physical characteristics of the used isotopes.
doc12	12	10 validation procedures with 1 GBq Tc-99m-pertechnetate confirmed functionality.
doc12	13	38 PRRT and 13 RLT procedures were performed successfully and completely.
doc12	14	At least 98 % of the prescribed activities were infused.
doc12	15	No leakage of radioactivity occurred.
doc12	16	Dose rate measurements showed that the radiation in the box is shielded completely, and that exposure arises only from the infusion line outside the box and from the patient.
doc12	17	CONCLUSION
doc12	18	The presented application system for intravenous radionuclide therapies is feasible, safe, and cost-efficient.
doc12	19	It has been shown that Lu-177-PRRT and -RLT can be performed without complications while ensuring nearly complete infusion of the prescribed radiopharmaceutical dose.
doc12	20	Radiation exposure of the applying physician and other staff is low.
doc12	21	The construction of the shielding box ensures complete shielding of all radionuclides currently used for radiomolecular therapies.
doc13	1	Management of hepatic encephalopathy in Germany: a survey among physicians.
doc13	2	BACKGROUND
doc13	3	Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a severe complication of liver cirrhosis with impairment of quality of life and prognosis.
doc13	4	Management patterns among physicians have not been investigated yet.
doc13	5	METHODS
doc13	6	A questionnaire containing 17 questions was sent out to 1468 gastroenterologists and 120 general practitioners (GPs).
doc13	7	It included questions regarding diagnostic, therapeutic, and management strategies used in patients with overt HE (OHE) and covert HE (CHE).
doc13	8	RESULTS
doc13	9	The response rate was 12 % (n = 172) for gastroenterologists and 45 % (n = 54) for GPs.
doc13	10	Of gastroenterologists, 26.7 % examine patients with an initial diagnosis of liver cirrhosis regarding HE.
doc13	11	Gastroenterologists favored a combination of different testing strategies
doc13	12	(27.9 %) and clinical examination
doc13	13	(23.0 %), while the biggest part of the GPs use clinical examination
doc13	14	(55.3 %); 63.7 % of gastroenterologists and 28.3 % of GPs give correct nutritional advices to patients with HE.
doc13	15	Treatment strategies for acute bouts of OHE and secondary prophylaxis varied widely in both groups.
doc13	16	Preferred medication was lactulose followed by rifaximin or a combination therapy.
doc13	17	More than half of the GPs
doc13	18	(53.7 %) were not familiar with minimal HE (MHE).
doc13	19	About one-third of both groups never tried to diagnose MHE.
doc13	20	CONCLUSION
doc13	21	Our data strongly indicate that management of HE is very heterogeneous among gastroenterologists as well as selected GPs working in Germany and not driven by evidence-based international guidelines.
doc13	22	Thus, the national guideline is more than welcome.
doc14	1	Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) is often used in German rehabilitation research.
doc14	2	The manuscript shortly describes the evolution of QCA and Mayring's approach to QCA with its 3 varieties: summarizing, explication and structuring, including its general procedural model.
doc14	3	Furthermore it deals with the importance of the category system and different forms of category building (deductive vs. inductive).
doc14	4	These remarks are supplemented by some thoughts on software use, presentation of results and quantifications.
doc14	5	Finally trustworthiness of the analysis and quality criteria for qualitative (content analytic) research proposed by Mayring are discussed.
doc15	1	Acute Pulmonary Embolism: Imaging Techniques, Findings, Endovascular Treatment and Differential Diagnoses.
doc15	2	BACKGROUND
doc15	3	Acute thrombotic pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially fatal event with imaging playing a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of these patients.
doc15	4	METHOD
doc15	5	This review discusses imaging techniques, diagnostic algorithms, imaging findings and endovascular treatment of acute thrombotic PE, and illustrates important differential diagnoses relating to the spectrum of acute non-thrombotic PE and non-embolic pulmonary artery disease.
doc15	6	The review emphasizes information relevant for everyday radiological practice and highlights recent advances that can be readily applied in the clinical routine.
doc15	7	RESULTS/CONCLUSION
doc15	8	Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the current reference standard for the diagnosis of acute PE.
doc15	9	Ventilation and perfusion (VQ) scanning or - in centers with adequate expertise - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated in pregnant or young patients and patients with contraindications to iodinated contrast.
doc15	10	Invasive angiography is reserved for patients with intended endovascular treatment.
doc15	11	Artifacts, acute non-thrombotic PE, chronic PE and non-embolic pulmonary artery diseases should always be considered as differential diagnoses.
doc15	12	KEY POINTS

doc16	1	[Disseminated tuberculosis mimicking metastatic gastric cancer - a case report].
doc16	2	Increasing numbers of active tuberculosis in Germany were recorded in the last years.
doc16	3	Thus, also extrapulmonary manifestations of tuberculosis gain clinical significance as differential diagnoses, especially when a metastatic tumor disease is suspected.
doc16	4	We report the case of a 77-year-old male patient who presented with unilateral leg pain and B symptoms.
doc16	5	Further investigations revealed an osteolytic mass in the sacrum as well as CT-morphological findings consistent with metastatic gastric cancer.
doc16	6	However, transgastric biopsies showed necrotising granuloma with giant cells leading to molecular and cultural detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis instead of suspected neoplastic tissue.
doc16	7	A nine-month treatment regimen for suspected disseminated tuberculosis with bone involvement was initiated according to national guidelines.
doc16	8	Clinical and radiological follow up examinations after treatment completion showed complete remission.
doc19	1	[Pediatric and adolescent varicocele - When, why and how to treat?]
doc19	2	The treatment of a varicocele in childhood and adolescence is considered very controversial.
doc19	3	In the past varicocele was often diagnosed during the medical examination for military purposes, but today varicocele is common in the J1 exam and is found rather frequently.
doc19	4	However, we are still lacking evidence-based recommendations.
doc19	5	This means that urologists and paediatric urologists are increasingly confronted with the question of whether intervention is necessary or not.
doc19	6	The literature on this is very contradictory.
doc19	7	Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have recently shown that there are only modest benefits of intervention in terms of testicular size and spermiogram quality.
doc19	8	Solid data on the impact on paternity rates are still lacking.
doc19	9	However, it has been shown that if an intervention is to be made, the lymphatic sparing techniques have a distinct advantage.
doc19	10	Possible indications for intervention may be the persistent difference in size of the testes (> 20 % for at least 6 months), a symptomatic varicocele (very subjective criterion), a pathological spermiogram (better 2), and possibly the presence of additional fertility-limiting factors.
doc2	1	[Visual Acuity and Visual Field in Optic Disc Drusen].
doc2	2	BACKGROUND
doc2	3	It has been assumed that visual field defects in optic disc drusen slowly increase with age or occur during adolescence and do not change substantially in later years.
doc2	4	In our study, we aimed to validate these assumptions.
doc2	5	MATERIAL AND METHODS
doc2	6	255 consecutive cases with optic disc drusen were identified from the patient records of the University Eye Hospital Tübingen; the diagnosis was verified and visual fields were quantified as long as available and of sufficient quality.
doc2	7	Additionally, visual acuity was evaluated.
doc2	8	RESULTS
doc2	9	In 104 cases, quantifiable visual fields of sufficient quality for both eyes were available.
doc2	10	In general, few patients with marked visual field defects could be detected.
doc2	11	Only three patients showed visual field defects of ≥ 50% in both eyes.
doc2	12	Both eyes were usually involved to approximately the same extent.
doc2	13	Older age was correlated with more visual field defects.
doc2	14	Only one patient remained below visual acuity of 0.3 in both eyes.
doc2	15	DISCUSSION
doc2	16	By means of our patient base, a continuous slight decline in the visual field with age can be assumed.
doc2	17	Marked visual field defects were rare.
doc2	18	The same was true for visual acuity, which showed some mild decline above the age of 60 years.
doc22	1	Serum IgE and IgG responses to dietary antigens in dogs with and without cutaneous adverse food reactions.
doc22	2	BACKGROUND
doc22	3	It is suspected that many canine cutaneous adverse food reactions (CAFR) are true immunological hypersensitivities; however, few specific dietary allergens have been identified.
doc22	4	OBJECTIVE
doc22	5	To compare serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E and IgG reactivity to specific food antigens in privately owned dogs with and without CAFR.
doc22	6	ANIMALS
doc22	7	Eighteen adult dogs with nonseasonal pruritus recruited from a hospital population.
doc22	8	METHODS AND MATERIALS
doc22	9	Dogs were fed an extensively hydrolysed poultry-based diet exclusively for 12 weeks.
doc22	10	Serum was collected at the beginning of the trial.
doc22	11	Canine atopic dermatitis extent and severity index and pruritus Visual Analog Scale scoring were performed at the beginning and end of the trial.
doc22	12	Immunoblotting was performed to identify IgE and/or IgG binding to specific proteins in beef, egg, milk, chicken, pork, soy and wheat extracts.
doc22	13	RESULTS
doc22	14	A CAFR (defined as an unequivocal relapse of pruritus after dietary challenge) was diagnosed in 10 dogs, with 60% relapsing when fed chicken-based diets.
doc22	15	Binding of subjects' IgG to almost all proteins in all extracts was seen regardless of reported dietary history.
doc22	16	Few proteins were exclusively or predominantly bound by IgE in CAFR dogs.
doc22	17	Exceptions included a 42 kDa band (chicken), a 52 kDa band (beef), a 46 kDa band (beef and milk) and a poorly defined high molecular weight protein or proteins (beef and milk).
doc22	18	CONCLUSION
doc22	19	This study demonstrated three protein bands and a poorly defined band predominantly recognized by sera from dogs with CAFR relative to non-CAFR dog sera.
doc22	20	Almost all proteins were bound by IgG in all dogs, suggesting prior exposure to unreported foods.
doc23	1	Time course and local distribution of skin exposure of hand and fingers from [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-NOC synthesis using a self-shielded module.
doc23	2	AIM
doc23	3	The study examined the local dose distribution as well as the time course of skin exposure of hand and fingers from [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-NOC synthesis using a self-shielded synthesis module.
doc23	4	METHODS
doc23	5	A compact calibrated electronic dosimeter (ED) with a miniaturized probe was used for real-time measurements of skin dose equivalent Hp (0.07) (reference point: left and right index finger). A time resolved assessment of exposure during radiotracer production was performed.
doc23	6	Additionally, thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLD) were used to determine local dose distribution for five different positions (e. g. fingertips).
doc23	7	Cumulated Hp (0.07) estimated by ED was analysed and correlated with the measurements obtained by a TLD positioned close to the ED.
doc23	8	RESULTS
doc23	9	The cumulative skin exposure from the production process measured by ED, was 74.7 ± 32.7 µSv/GBq and 40.1 ± 14.3 µSv/GBq for the right and left hand, respectively.
doc23	10	The exposure recorded by the ED was in the average 19.4 % ± 40.0 %
doc23	11	(median = 21.3 %) lower compared to the results from TLD.
doc23	12	Highest exposure was recorded during synthesis (guided hand: 24.5 ± 12.2 µSv/GBq) and measuring of product yield including preparation of probes for quality control (guided hand: 36.1 ± 12.7 µSv/GBq).
doc23	13	The highest local exposure was measured by a TLD close to the tip of the index finger of the guiding hand (range: 773-1257 µS/GBq).
doc23	14	CONCLUSION
doc23	15	The chosen methodology using ED, proved to be a good concept for identifying procedure steps with an increased exposure level and to determine the time course of skin exposure and to identify procedure steps for further optimization of handling.
doc23	16	Furthermore, miniaturized electronic dosimeters may be used for online surveillance of local exposure rates at hands and fingers.
doc26	1	Alterations in circulating concentrations of IL-17, IL-31 and total IgE in dogs with atopic dermatitis.
doc26	2	BACKGROUND
doc26	3	The pathogenesis of canine atopic dermatitis (AD) is complex.
doc26	4	Dysregulation of the cutaneous immune system is considered an important regulator of the allergic response.
doc26	5	Exploration of association of interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-31, IgE and leukogram attributes with canine AD could provide novel insights into its immunopathology.
doc26	6	HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES
doc26	7	To investigate possible associations of IL-17, IL-3, IgE and leukogram attributes of canine AD.
doc26	8	ANIMALS
doc26	9	17 dogs diagnosed with AD and six healthy dogs.
doc26	10	METHODS AND MATERIALS
doc26	11	Circulating concentrations of IL-17, IL-31 and total IgE from sera samples were determined using commercial canine-specific quantitative immunoassay kits.
doc26	12	Complete blood cell counts were analysed by an automated haematology analyser.
doc26	13	Statistical differences between the two groups were determined using an unpaired t-test.
doc26	14	The degree of relationship between the IL-17, IL-31, IgE, total leukocyte count (TLC) values and clinical signs scores (Canine Atopic Dermatitis Lesion Index and pruritus Visual Analog Scale pVAS) was determined by Pearson's r correlation statistic.
doc26	15	RESULTS
doc26	16	Dogs with AD had significantly (P < 0.0001) higher circulating concentrations of IL-17, IL-31 and total IgE compared with healthy dogs.
doc26	17	Dogs with AD also had significantly higher TLC (P < 0.0002), absolute neutrophils (P < 0.0001) and absolute eosinophils (P < 0.0001) counts, and percentage of neutrophils (P < 0.03) and eosinophils (P < 0.0001) compared with healthy controls.
doc26	18	A significant positive correlation (r2  = 0.396; P < 0.007) between the pVAS and IL-31 was observed in dogs with AD.
doc26	19	CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE
doc26	20	Marked elevation in circulating IL-17, IL-31 and total IgE along with the abnormalities in leukogram may be associated with canine AD and could be possible targets in the therapeutic management of canine AD.
doc28	1	[Memorandum Registry for Health Services Research: Update 2019].
doc28	2	Health registries could be used to analyze questions concerning routine practice in healthcare.
doc28	3	Therefore, registries are a core method in health services research.
doc28	4	The German Network for Health Services Research (Deutsches Netzwerk Versorgungsforschung, DNVF) promotes the quality of registries by scientific exchange, organization of advanced training, and recommendations in the form of a memorandum "Registry for Health Services Research".
doc28	5	The current recommendations are an update of the memorandum's first version of 2010.
doc28	6	The update describes the capabilities and aims of registries in health services research.
doc28	7	Furthermore, it illustrates the state-of-the-art in designing and implementing health registries.
doc28	8	The memorandum provides developers the methodological basis to ensure high quality health registries.
doc28	9	It further provides users of health registries with insights that enable assessing the quality of data and results of health registries.
doc28	10	Finally, funding agencies and health policy actors can use the quality criteria to establish a framework for the financing and legislative requirements for health registries.
doc28	11	The memorandum provides first a definition of health registries and presents an overview of their utility in health services research and health care improvement.
doc28	12	Second, several areas of methodological importance for the development and operation of health registries are presented.
doc28	13	This includes the conceptual and preliminary design, implementation, technical organization of a health registry, statistical analysis, reporting of results, and data protection.
doc28	14	From these areas, criteria are deduced to allow the assessment of the quality of a health registry.

doc31	1	[Current standard of antibiotic prophylaxis in esophageal varices bleeding in Germany].
doc31	2	OBJECTIVES
doc31	3	Antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with liver cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding significantly reduces the risk of concomitant bacterial infections and early mortality.
doc31	4	The goal of our study was to determine the current status of antibiotic prophylaxis in departments of gastroenterology in Germany.
doc31	5	METHODS
doc31	6	Representatives of gastroenterology departments were asked to provide data about indication for, and duration of, antibiotic prophylaxis and choice of antibiotic in esophageal varices bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis.
doc31	7	RESULTS
doc31	8	326 of 779 contacted departments of gastroenterology participated in the study.
doc31	9	Whereas antibiotic prophylaxis is used in 98.5 % (n = 321/326) of cases, it is used only in 7.1 % (n = 23/322) depending on the Child-Pugh-Score.
doc31	10	In 19.4 % (n = 62/320), a prophylaxis is given even to patients with an elective banding of esophageal varices without bleeding.
doc31	11	Third generation cephalosporins are used most frequently (66.5 %; n = 248/373) followed by fluoroquinolones (19.9 %; n = 74/373).
doc31	12	The duration of prophylaxis was 3 days in most cases (32.3 %; n = 104/322), 1 day in 9.3 % (n = 30/322) and 7 days as recommended by German treatment guidelines in 24.8 % (n = 80/322).
doc31	13	A standard of procedure (SOP) for antibiotic prophylaxis in esophageal varices bleeding is available in 45.1 % (n = 147/326).
doc31	14	CONCLUSION
doc31	15	Our study shows that the applied standards for antibiotic prophylaxis in esophageal varices bleeding varies greatly in Germany.
doc31	16	Future studies about the necessary duration of prophylaxis and its dependency from the Child-Pugh-Score are needed so that unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions can be avoided.
doc31	17	The avoidance of antibiotic prophylaxis in elective banding of non-bleeding esophageal varices, which is not recommended by guidelines and was used by about 20 % of participants in our study, can already reduce antibiotic use.
doc32	1	Use of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Children and Adolescents.
doc32	2	While the need for anticoagulation in children has increased over the last decades, dose regimens of currently used anticoagulants, including low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and vitamin K antagonist (VKA), are still extrapolated from adult guidelines because well-designed clinical trials were never performed in children.
doc32	3	This approach is not optimal due to specific pediatric features of the hemostatic system and pathophysiology of thrombosis.
doc32	4	These anticoagulants also present several disadvantages that further hamper optimal anticoagulation of pediatric patients, especially newborns and infants.
doc32	5	The new direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which have the potential to overcome these disadvantages, were extensively investigated in adults and have become a valid alternative to LMWH and VKA for anticoagulation in the adult population.
doc32	6	Several pediatric trials on all approved DOACs are currently ongoing, providing specific pediatric formulations and age- and weight-adjusted dose guidelines.
doc32	7	First results of phase III trials indicate that DOACs are at least as efficient and safe as LMWH and VKA for the treatment and prevention of thrombotic events in children with different clinical conditions.
doc32	8	This review article summarizes available data from terminated and ongoing controlled trials on DOACs in children and adolescents.
doc35	1	[Prevention of "contrast-induced" acute kidney injury - practical considerations].
doc35	2	Acute kidney injury (AKI) episodes after iodine radiocontrast application are decreasing since non-ionic agents are routinely used.
doc35	3	Retrospective studies (in total comprising more than 100 000 patients) DO NOT show increased AKI rates after CT scans with the application of radiocontrast (vs. uncontrasted CT scans).
doc35	4	AKI rates are generally higher after intra-arterial (i. a.) compared with intra-venous (i. v.) radiocontrast application - cholesterol embolism due to catheter manipulation does play a role in this setting.
doc35	5	Because of the multifactorial pathogenesis the term "contrast-associated AKI" (CA-AKI) should be used preferentially.
doc35	6	The AMACING trial, which prospectively evaluated the use of i. v. volume administration before contrast application to prevent CA-AKI, DID NOT show a benefit for volume therapy.
doc35	7	Instead, the trial found a significant increase in symptomatic heart failure episodes in patients after volume administrastion.
doc35	8	"Hydration" before (emergency) contrasted CT scans therefore can put patients at risk through both volume overload and diagnostic delay.
doc35	9	The PRESERVE trial prospectively evaluated the use of volume administration and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) before i. a. contrast application to prevent CA-AKI.
doc35	10	While NAC, which was placebo controlled, did not show any benefit (and therefore should not be used anymore), all patients in the PRESERVE trial received i. v. volume (either sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate).
doc35	11	Interestingly, the incidence of CA-AKI in both groups was below 5 % and hence almost half of what was expected based on previous trials.
doc35	12	If the baseline volume status is checked in order to avoid overload, volume administration in patients with i. a. contrast application can be safely performed until definitive data are available.
doc35	13	The type of solution can be pragmatically guided by the patient's acid base status.
doc35	14	While preventive measures to avoid CA-AKI are limited, the clinical relevance of (any) AKI remains - new data showing increased morbidity and mortality with creatinine increments of onl 0.3 mg/dl.
doc35	15	In order to distinguish CA-AKI from other, potentially treatably forms of AKI (e. g. pre- or post-renal AKI), early consultation of a nephrologist seems favorable.
doc36	1	[Lung Cancer screening?
doc36	2	Who should get it and how it should be done].
doc36	3	In large clinical studies, lung cancer screening has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing lung cancer mortality in defined high risk populations using low-dose CT techniques.
doc36	4	However, in different studies, results and definitions of persons of high risk have varied which needs to be taken into account when screening programmes should be implemented in clinical routine.
doc36	5	In order those programmes to be as effective as possible, the careful definition of a risk population is crucial as much as the careful use of radiant exposure.
doc36	6	Ideally, the number of false positive findings should be as low as possible with the best reduction in lung cancer mortality and limited financial burden.
doc37	1	Analysis of Retinal Vessel Pulsation with Electrographic Gating - Pulsation Amplitude and the Influence of Hyperoxia.
doc37	2	PURPOSE
doc37	3	To analyse the amplitude of vessel pulsation in the retina and to determine whether constriction of the vessels by oxygen would decrease their pulsation amplitude and could thus be used to quantify the rigidity of the retinal vessels.
doc37	4	PATIENTS AND METHODS
doc37	5	The study included 20 healthy young subjects.
doc37	6	With the RVA (retinal vessel analyser), we aimed to quantify vessel pulsations under normal and hyperoxic conditions.
doc37	7	Electrocardiographic (ECG)-gated RVA was used for this purpose, with change in vessel pulsation as the primary endpoint and shift in vessel pulsation during the heart cycle as the secondary endpoint.
doc37	8	Furthermore, we assessed the correlation between the amplitude of retinal vessel wall pulsation and blood pressure.
doc37	9	Descriptive statistics, paired t-tests, and correlation analysis were applied.
doc37	10	RESULTS
doc37	11	Retinal veins in proximity to the optic disc demonstrated the highest pulsation amplitude under all conditions.
doc37	12	All retinal vessels significantly constricted under hyperoxic conditions.
doc37	13	There was no significant change in the amplitude of vessel pulsation nor a significant shift in the pulsation cycle under hyperoxic conditions in the examined cohort.
doc37	14	No correlation was found between systemic blood pressure parameters and amplitude of retinal vessel wall pulsation or any change in this.
doc37	15	CONCLUSION
doc37	16	ECG-gated RVA recording is not able to detect any relevant change in vessel pulsation behaviour under oxygen, despite clearly observed vasoconstriction in retinal vessels.
doc37	17	New approaches are necessary to reliably quantify the rigidity of the retinal vessels.
doc39	1	[Diagnostic Challenges of Mixed Dust Silicosis (Mixed Dust Pneumoconiosis) - 5 Case Reports].
doc39	2	Exposure to granular or fibrous inorganic dusts of the alveolar dust fraction initiates inflammatory and fibrotic lung processes.
doc39	3	Furthermore, such exposures are associated with an increased risk for lung cancer.
doc39	4	By taking a detailed occupational history into consideration the diagnosis of relatively frequent pneumoconioses such as silicosis or asbestosis with dominating pictures, i. e. with its predominant rounded or irregular opacities located especially in the upper and lower lung fields, respectively, is mostly not difficult.
doc39	5	However, rarely exposure to a single agent exists.
doc39	6	Rather, mixed dust exposures occurring at the same time or in the follow-up have to be taken into consideration, e. g. quartz and carbon in hard coal mines, quartz, asbestos, various other components of cement and concrete dusts in the construction industry.
doc39	7	It is also important that during the working life, changes of working processes and used raw materials as well as changes of jobs are associated with variations of type and intensity of exposures.
doc39	8	This heterogenicity of exposures and of the associated intrapulmonary depositions result in variations of the pulmonary structural changes, i. e. more or less modifications of the pictures of pneumoconioses as described being typical in textbooks.
doc39	9	This is associated with diagnostic difficulties, especially with regard to the differential diagnosis of idiopathic interstitial lung diseases.
doc39	10	There is also evidence for genetic influence on disease susceptibility and on the degree of pathohistological changes.
doc39	11	This publication includes 5 case reports; all of them were initially diagnosed as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, but a detailed workup of the author, mostly during social court litigations, showed that mixed dust pneumoconioses were the most likely diagnoses.

doc41	1	[Dual Pathway Inhibition in Atherosclerosis - Which Patients Benefit?]
doc41	2	Dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT) with low-dose rivaroxaban in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is available to patients with stable atherosclerotic disease as a new therapeutic option.
doc41	3	The results of the COMPASS trial demonstrate a significant relative risk reduction of cardiovascular outcomes by 24 % with low-dose DAT in patients with stable peripheral arterial disease or coronary heart disease.
doc41	4	Despite a guideline adherent secondary prevention therapy, the cardiovascular event rate with ASA alone during the mean study period of almost two years was 5.4 %. The absolute reduction of the event rate by the low-dose DAT is low at 1.3 %. Consequently, it is important to identify groups of patients at high risk for cardiovascular events.
doc41	5	These patients are particularly qualified to receive a DAT regimen and can be characterized using high-risk features.
doc41	6	The individual ischemic risk profile may be further defined by the presence of polyvascular atherosclerosis, concomitant diseases, and ischemic events in the past.
doc41	7	The quo ad vitam reduced prognosis of patients with polyvascular atherosclerosis advocates a polyvascular screening, even in supposedly stable patients with coronary heart disease and peripheral arterial disease.
doc41	8	An intensification of antithrombotic therapy is naturally associated with an increased risk of bleeding.
doc41	9	Therefore, the risk-reduction of ischemic events should be weighed individually against the risk of bleeding.
doc41	10	A low-dose DAT is particularly suitable for patients with a high ischemic risk and a low risk of bleeding.
doc42	1	Sterile granulomatous dermatitis and lymphadenitis (juvenile cellulitis) in adult dogs: a retrospective analysis of 90 cases (2004-2018).
doc42	2	BACKGROUND
doc42	3	It has long been speculated that sterile granulomatous dermatitis and lymphadenitis (SGDL) occurs in adult dogs.
doc42	4	However, only three published case reports exist.
doc42	5	HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES
doc42	6	To describe clinical presentation, identify breed predispositions, and assess treatment and outcomes of adult dogs with the histopathological diagnosis of SGDL.
doc42	7	ANIMALS
doc42	8	Included are 90 dogs with biopsies submitted to a veterinary teaching hospital with a histopathological diagnosis consistent with SGDL, from 2004 to 2018, of which 35 had medical records available for review.
doc42	9	METHODS
doc42	10	Data were analysed retrospectively from histopathology submission forms, medical records, surveys and telephone calls.
doc42	11	Scoring systems were created to aid statistical analysis of outcomes.
doc42	12	RESULTS
doc42	13	Havanese dog (P < 0.0001), Australian shepherd dog (P < 0.0001), Irish setter (P < 0.0001), Dachshund (P = 0.0002), bichon frise (P = 0.0003) and Maltese dog (P = 0.004) were significantly over-represented breeds.
doc42	14	The median age at onset was 1,292 days (3.54 years).
doc42	15	Dogs up to five years of age were significantly over-represented (P < 0.01).
doc42	16	Of 35 dogs with medical records available for review, the median treatment duration was 60 days and the median time to remission 28 days.
doc42	17	Remission status was not established for five dogs but the remaining 30 dogs reached remission.
doc42	18	Nineteen dogs remained in complete remission.
doc42	19	Recrudescence occurred in 11 dogs (median follow-up 60 days).
doc42	20	CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE
doc42	21	This study shows a close parallel in clinical appearance, histopathological results and clinical behaviour, of both adult and juvenile onset SGDL; therefore, SGDL should be considered as a differential diagnosis for dogs of all ages.
doc43	1	[The Thyroid and Pregnancy].
doc43	2	Pregnancy has a profound impact on the thyroid gland and its function.
doc43	3	This has to be considered in the assessment of thyroid function tests on the basis of trimester-specific reference intervals during pregnancy and in the decision making when to start therapy.
doc43	4	The adverse impact of overt thyroid disorders in pregnancy is well understood, while the relevance of subclinical thyroid disorders and presence of thyroid antibodies remains a bit controversial.
doc43	5	In euthyroid pregnant women with positive thyroid antibodies, levothyroxine (LT4) therapy may be discussed individually in the case of recurrent abortions.
doc43	6	Furthermore, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes seems to be increased in the presence of both thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-elevation and positive thyroid antibodies.
doc43	7	Therefore, in case of subclinical hypothyroidism, taking in consideration the thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab)-status individual decision-making and liberal initiation of LT4 therapy is recommended.
doc43	8	In contrast, overt hypothyroidism is a strong indication for LT4 administration, aiming at rapid achievement of euthyroidism.
doc43	9	The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is transient gestational thyrotoxicosis mediated by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which leads to a reduction or suppression of TSH in the first trimester that does not require antithyroid medication.
doc43	10	In other causes of overt hyperthyroidism antithyroid drugs (propylthiouracil or thionamides) need to be considered carefully and require interdisciplinary management.
doc43	11	The presented recommendations are based on the current guideline of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the European Thyroid Association (ETA) as well as recently published literature.
doc44	1	[Salvage lymph node dissection for nodal recurrent prostate cancer].
doc44	2	Recent advances in functional imaging, such as prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA PET/CT), provide earlier detection of nodal recurrent prostate cancer.
doc44	3	Current studies on metastasis-directed therapy in patients with node-only recurrence suggest a positive influence on the prognosis in selected patients.
doc44	4	Nevertheless, most studies are retrospective and, due to a lack of high-level evidence, salvage lymph node dissection (SLND) is not recommended by current guidelines.
doc44	5	The aim of this work is to provide a critical summary of the current data on SLND in patients with nodal recurrent prostate cancer with a focus on imaging procedures, extent of SLND and oncological outcome.
doc44	6	European guidelines recommend the use of choline or PSMA PET/CT imaging if prostate cancer recurrence is suspected.
doc44	7	PSMA PET/CT is superior to choline PET/CT in sensitivity and specificity and should be the preferred approach.
doc44	8	Nevertheless, if SLND is performed, common practice is bilateral SLND - even if only unilateral lymph node involvement is detected by PSMA PET/CT.
doc44	9	However, unilateral SLND can also be considered.
doc44	10	A randomised prospective trial (ProSTone) is being initiated for clarification.PSMA radioguided surgery seems to be a new promising surgical approach.
doc44	11	It facilitates the intraoperative detection of lymph node metastases.
doc44	12	However, long-term data are still awaited.
doc44	13	All in all, SLND achieves a respectable biochemical response rate in carefully selected patients.
doc44	14	Nevertheless, prospective studies are necessary in the future in order to define the clinical usefulness more precisely.

doc46	2	Current guidelines have been published for the diagnosis and therapy of neuroendocrine neoplasms of the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) system 1.
doc46	3	Systemic therapy of inoperable advanced neuroendocrine tumors includes biotherapy with somatostatin analogas, peptid receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with 177Lutetium-DOTA-TATE, chemotherapy with steptozotocin/5-fluorouracil or capecitabine/temozolomide and molecular targeted therapy with everolimus or sunitinib 1 2.
doc46	4	For symptom control in patients with carcinoid syndrome biotherapy with somatostatin analogs, PRRT, loco-regional and local-ablative interventional procedures of liver metastases as well as the peripheral serotonin synthesis inhibitor telotristat Ethyl 1 2 3 4 are highly effective.

doc48	1	Long-acting reversible contraception: A route to reproductive justice or injustice.
doc48	2	This article presents information on unintended pregnancies and the ongoing efforts of policy makers to promote long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) to reduce the numbers of such pregnancies.
doc48	3	Also discussed is the tension between the encouragement of LARC to promote the public's interests in achieving that goal versus the need to assure that all women can decide about their bodies and reproductive needs.
doc48	4	Our discussion includes information, primarily from the United States, on (a) risks associated with unintended pregnancies, (b) LARC devices approved in the United States (copper intrauterine devices (IUDs), hormone IUDs, and implants), (c) public and social benefits of increasing the use of LARC, (d) disadvantages and barriers to using LARC, (e) dangers of promoting LARC in unjust ways, and (f) the meaning of reproductive justice and its connection to social justice.
doc48	5	By sharing the information with the audience of this journal, we hope that it will be integrated into clinical work and research on mental health and development.
doc48	6	We also hope that experts in those fields will become discussants in the conversation regarding women's reproductive health and social justice that is taking place in the United States and elsewhere.

doc55	1	Extensive Embolization of Splanchnic Artery Aneurysms due to Segmental Arterial Mediolysis.
doc55	2	AIM
doc55	3	Segmental arterial mediolysis (SAM) is a rare non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory, non-infectious arteriopathy in middle-aged patients that tends to affect medium-sized splanchnic arteries typically leading to dissecting aneurysms which in case of rupture have a high mortality.
doc55	4	Treatment options include watchful waiting and endovascular or surgical intervention.
doc55	5	There are no official treatment guidelines and to the best of our knowledge, there has not been any report of extensive exclusion of multiple splanchnic vessel regions in affected patients to date.
doc55	6	MATERIALS AND METHODS
doc55	7	We retrospectively examined the outcome of extensive splanchnic embolization in four patients suffering from SAM between 2011 and 2016 with follow-up periods of up to 7 years.
doc55	8	RESULTS
doc55	9	One patient presented with abdominal pain due to rupture of aneurysms of the pancreaticoduodenal arcade, one with abdominal pain due to dissection, and two were clinically asymptomatic but displayed rapidly progressing disease over the course of 12 months.
doc55	10	All patients were treated with complete exclusion of the diseased vessel segments by coiling all branches to and from the diseased segment.
doc55	11	In three cases the main hepatic artery was excluded completely.
doc55	12	In one case, the complete vascular bed of the celiac axis was excluded by coiling the distal vessel branches and placing a stent graft over the orifice of the celiac trunk.
doc55	13	During a follow-up period of a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 7 years after intervention, there were no immediate or long-term complications except for a temporary arterio-portal fistula.
doc55	14	Interestingly, no new diseased areas of SAM were detected afterwards.
doc55	15	CONCLUSION
doc55	16	Extensive endovascular exclusion of the entire diseased arterial segment with coils seems to be a safe and effective treatment option in patients with SAM presenting with ruptured or rapidly growing aneurysms.
doc55	17	Provided that patients have normal liver function and proper portal venous flow, risk of hepatobiliary complications seems to be low even after extensive embolization.
doc55	18	KEY POINTS
doc55	19	· An asymptomatic SAM can be followed up..
doc55	20	· In case of disease progression or suspicion of aneurysm rupture, an endovascular approach is indicated where the whole pathological vessel bed should be excluded with coils..
doc55	21	· It seems that exclusion of even extensive vessel areas is tolerated..

doc59	1	[Quo vadis 116117?
doc59	2	Nationwide Overview of the Status Quo and Current Changes].
doc59	3	BACKGROUND
doc59	4	The on-call service (emergency service) has been reachable under 116117 in Germany since 2012.
doc59	5	Nevertheless, this number is almost unknown to most Germans.
doc59	6	A literature review of emergency service has shown that information which can be found is often incomplete and unclear.
doc59	7	Thus, the aim of this study was to cover the status quo regarding 116117 at the federal level in Germany.
doc59	8	METHODS
doc59	9	In February 2019 all physicians working with a statutory health insurance were asked to fill in an online survey.
doc59	10	The survey was based on a literature review regarding emergency service and on-call service at the federal level in Germany.
doc59	11	The questionnaire covered different areas.
doc59	12	In this paper only results regarding 116117 will be reported.
doc59	13	Data were analyzed descriptively.
doc59	14	RESULTS
doc59	15	The organization and range of services as well as the qualifications of the staff are structured differently at the federal level.
doc59	16	Services provided by 116117 are arrangements for home visits, out-of-hours service appointments, consulting, and forwarding to 112.
doc59	17	Staff includes physician assistants, nurses, and physicians.
doc59	18	CONCLUSION
doc59	19	Standardized regulations at the federal level might improve transparency.
doc59	20	The planned extension of 116117 to include a standardized initial medical assessment as well as 24/7 accessibility could facilitate patient access to adequate medical treatment.
doc6	1	[Development of an Online Intervention for Adolescents and Young Adults Engaging in Nonsuicidal Self-injury].
doc6	2	Development of an Online Intervention for Adolescents and Young Adults Engaging in Nonsuicidal Self-injury Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a prevalent phenomenon in adolescence.
doc6	3	Despite the existence of effective psychotherapeutic interventions, the majority of affected adolescents and young adults do not receive any treatment.
doc6	4	Structural (e. g., no specific interventions, limited resources, limited accessibility) as well as individual factors (e. g., low help-seeking behavior) impede access to adequate clinical care for adolescent NSSI.
doc6	5	Online interventions offer the possibility to provide specific interventions independent of one's location or local healthcare structures.
doc6	6	Because of its high confidentiality and accessibility, the Internet also reaches adolescents with low help-seeking behavior.
doc6	7	There is already evidence for online interventions concerning different mental health issues, like depression and anxiety.
doc6	8	However, regarding NSSI, there are no effective, online interventions.
doc6	9	Thus, we developed an online intervention based on an already evaluated short term program specific for adolescents and young adults with NSSI within the German STAR consortium (STAR: Self-Injury - Treatment, Assessment, Recovery).
doc6	10	Within a randomised controlled trial, the intervention will be evaluated regarding its efficacy.
doc60	1	Herd health monitoring in dairy farms - discover metabolic diseases.
doc60	2	An overview.
doc60	3	The transition period, 3 weeks before and 3 weeks after calving, is inevitably accompanied by a negative energy balance, which sometimes causes metabolic disturbances, such as ketosis.
doc60	4	Subclinical ketosis (SCK) is defined as an increase in the β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration to ≥ 1.2 mmol/l in the blood.
doc60	5	According to a recent study, a value of ≥ 0.7 mmol/l of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in the blood indicates the potential development of the poor metabolic adaption syndrome (PMAS).
doc60	6	With a herd prevalence of 21 %, and an incidence of approximately 40 % within the first 2 weeks after calving, SCK is a relevant herd health problem.
doc60	7	The milk yield decreases in the first 2 weeks postpartum by 3-5.3 kg/d for each ketotic cow, and the total milk reduction through the whole lactation period of 305 days averages 112 kg (SD 89 kg).
doc60	8	Although the cow does not display any clinical signs of ketosis at this stage, the risk of developing associated production diseases like retained placenta, metritis, displaced abomasum, lameness and clinical ketosis increases and the expected performance in terms of milk production will decrease.
doc60	9	The herd health status deteriorates and the risk for early culling increases.
doc60	10	Another impact factor is the financial aspect, which includes costs for early death, reduced milk production, reproduction losses, and associated production diseases.
doc60	11	In the literature, the calculated costs per SCK case vary between $ 78 and $ 289.
doc60	12	The gold standard diagnostic test for SCK is the photometric measurement of BHB in blood.
doc60	13	This method is accurate, but results are delayed due to the required laboratory analysis.
doc60	14	There are also some rapid cow-side tests, i. e. urine or milk strip tests available to identify ketotic cows.
doc60	15	The common disadvantage of these methods is that they are not suitable for herd health monitoring because of the need to collect samples from each cow manually and the high rates of false negative results.
doc60	16	However, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is suitable for herd health monitoring.
doc60	17	It is already being used for the analysis of milk composition.
doc60	18	This inexpensive, rapid and simple technique has a specificity of 83.8 % and a sensitivity of 82.4 %. Therefore, FTIR is an early and easy method for detecting ketotic cows, that could help reduce financial and performance losses associated with ketosis.
doc64	1	In vitro killing of canine strains of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Escherichia coli by cefazolin, cefovecin, doxycycline and pradofloxacin over a range of bacterial densities.
doc64	2	BACKGROUND
doc64	3	Bacterial densities likely fluctuate during infection and may exceed the bacterial density used in susceptibility testing.
doc64	4	As such, investigation of bacterial killing by antibiotics over a range of varying bacterial densities may provide important differences between compounds and could impact drug selection for therapy.
doc64	5	HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES
doc64	6	To measure killing of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Escherichia coli by cefazolin, cefovecin, doxycycline and pradofloxacin at clinically relevant (minimum inhibitory, mutant prevention, maximum serum and maximum tissue) drug concentrations against varying densities of bacteria.
doc64	7	ANIMALS/MATERIALS
doc64	8	Bacterial strains collected from dogs with urinary tract infections were studied.
doc64	9	METHODS AND MATERIALS
doc64	10	High bacterial densities ranging from 106 to 109 colony forming units (cfu)/mL were exposed to minimum inhibitory, mutant prevention, blood and tissue drug concentrations, and the percentages (log10 ) of viable cells killed following 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 h of drug exposure were quantified.
doc64	11	RESULTS
doc64	12	Doxycycline exhibited bacteriostatic properties with less killing than the other three agents.
doc64	13	For example, at a 107  cfu/mL density of S. pseudintermedius, more cells were killed by pradofloxacin (P < 0.0001) and cefovecin (P = 0.0014) but not cefazolin when compared to doxycycline at the maximum serum drug concentration following 12 h of drug exposure.
doc64	14	CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE
doc64	15	Differences were seen between some drugs in the speed and extent of bacterial killing; this could be clinically important and may impact drug selection and length of therapy.
doc65	1	Exploration of the Relationship Between Gut Microbiota and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): a Review.
doc65	2	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine and metabolic syndrome (MS) with a complex etiology, and its pathogenesis is not yet clear.
doc65	3	In recent years, the correlation between gut microbiota (GM) and metabolic disease has become a hot topic in research, leading to a number of new ideas about the etiology and pathological mechanisms of PCOS.
doc65	4	The literature shows that GM can cause insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, chronic inflammation and metabolic syndrome (obesity, diabetes) and may contribute to the development of PCOS by influencing energy absorption, the pathways of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), lipopolysaccharides, choline and bile acids, intestinal permeability and the brain-gut axis.
doc65	5	As part of the treatment of PCOS, fecal microbiota transplantation, supplementation with prebiotics and traditional Chinese medicine can be used to regulate GM and treat disorders.
doc65	6	This article reviews possible mechanisms and treatment options for PCOS, based on methods which target the GM, and offers new ideas for the treatment of PCOS.
doc66	1	[Evaluation of examination preparation methods in veterinary students].
doc66	2	OBJECTIVE
doc66	3	As part of a study on competence-based assessment, students of the University of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover (TiHo), were asked to fill in an online questionnaire regarding their exam preparation and common examination formats.
doc66	4	The aim of this investigation was to attain the students' opinion on different exam formats as well as the intensity and method of their preparation in order to further improve and develop the assessment formats.
doc66	5	PARTICIPANTS, MATERIAL AND METHODS
doc66	6	Data was collected using an online questionnaire developed in LimeSurvey® (LimeSurvey GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) which included 29 questions and 3 follow-up questions.
doc66	7	A link to the questionnaire was sent to all veterinary students at the TiHo by e-mail.
doc66	8	RESULTS
doc66	9	A total of 215 questionnaires were completed and entered the evaluation.
doc66	10	It was shown that the duration of the exam preparation depended on the specific exam format.
doc66	11	Students' preparation time for an oral exam was longer than for a written-electronic exam.
doc66	12	In the students' view, the assessment contents of oral examinations appeared to be more "relevant for later professional life".
doc66	13	Electronic exams, on the other hand, were perceived as being more "fair" and less stressful.
doc66	14	30.3 % of respondents indicated to be suffering from test anxiety.
doc66	15	CONCLUSION
doc66	16	Based on these findings, new recommendations for the development of teaching/learning materials may be derived.
doc66	17	The opinions of students collected in this investigation provide an up-to-date insight into their perception of examinations.
doc66	18	These results may serve as a valuable contribution to the optimization of examination scenarios in veterinary education.
doc66	19	In addition, such surveys contribute to university-wide quality management of the examination systems.
doc69	1	[National Learning Objectives Catalogue in Surgery - General Part Defining Competences of Medical School Graduates in Surgery].
doc69	2	Competency-based medical education is needed in order to meet the requirements of medical care currently and in the future.
doc69	3	The basis of this are activity-based learning objectives that are merged in competency-based catalogues.
doc69	4	A basis for a core curriculum of undergraduate medical training is the National Catalogue of Learning Objectives for Undergraduate Medical Education (NKLM).
doc69	5	Already in 2013, for surgery, the competencies which medical students should have achieved after completing the practical year (PJ) in relation to surgical diseases were defined in the special part of the National Catalogue of Learning Objectives in Surgery (NKLC).
doc69	6	In the now amended general part of the NKLC, interdisciplinary competencies were defined and consented from all surgical disciplines, that are relevant for all surgical disciplines and that all representatives from the different surgical disciplines should incorporate in their surgical training.
doc69	7	The complete NKLC is now available for faculties, teachers and students for trial (available online: https://www.dgch.de/index.php?id=190&L=528).
doc69	8	The guiding principle for the entire development process was to make sure that students gain all competencies they need when starting to work as a medical doctor and therefor to increase patient safety.

doc71	2	The sensitivity of confocal microscopy ranges between 80 and 90% and thus lies above the sensitivity of pathogen identification by microbiological culture.
doc71	3	Typically, in vivo confocal microscopy enables us to diagnose mycotic keratitis non-invasively and atraumatically on the day of admission.
doc71	4	Herein we present a patient with an ulcer on a corneal graft, pronounced corneal endothelial epithelial decompensation and a retrocorneal fungal adhesion after repeat-keratoplasty 5 years ago - due to chronic graft rejection after keratoplasty for Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy.
doc71	5	Clinically there was a suspicion of fungal keratitis.
doc71	6	Conventional en face confocal microscopy, however, did not detect hyphae.
doc71	7	Due to the pronounced corneal endothelial epithelial decompensation, we were able to detect the fungal hyphae only after repeat penetrating keratoplasty by means of inverted in vitro confocal microscopy on the day of surgery.
doc71	8	Histology confirmed the diagnosis of keratomycosis.
doc72	1	[Successful intraductal radiofrequency ablation of residual adenoma tissue following endoscopic papillectomy].
doc72	2	Treatment of adenoma of the major duodenal papilla is often a challenge for the endoscopist.
doc72	3	We report about two patients with papillary adenoma who had residual adenoma in the center of the ductus hepatocholedochus papillary region after endoscopic papillectomy.
doc72	4	Due to missing possibility of further endoscopic resection we carried out endobiliary radiofrequency ablation instead of surgical treatment.
doc72	5	In follow-up examination, there where no macroscopic or histological relapse, therefore endobiliary radiofrequency ablation needs to be discussed as an alternative to surgical therapy option.
doc73	1	A hermeneutic study of integrating psychotherapist competence in postnatal Child Health Care: Parents' perspectives.
doc73	2	A child's emotional and social development depends on the parents' provision of optimal support.
doc73	3	Many parents with perinatal distress experience difficulties in mastering parenthood and seek help from professionals within primary healthcare.
doc73	4	A clinical project was launched in Stockholm, where psychodynamic psychotherapists provided short-term consultations at Child Health Centers.
doc73	5	This study qualitatively explored parents' experiences of perinatal distress and of receiving help by nurses and therapists in the project.
doc73	6	Thirteen parents were interviewed, and their responses were analyzed with a hermeneutical method.
doc73	7	Three main themes crystallized; accessibility of psychological help and detection of emotional problems; experiences of therapy at the Child Health Center; and the therapists' technique.
doc73	8	Parents were also clustered into three so-called ideal types: the insecure; parents in crisis; and parents with lifelong psychological problems.
doc73	9	Parents experienced obstacles in accessing psychological care within primary healthcare.
doc73	10	Psychotherapists with a holistic family perspective and who managed to oscillate between insight-promoting and supportive interventions were especially appreciated.
doc73	11	Patient categories who benefitted from insight promotion and support, respectively, were identified.
doc78	1	[Mediators of Problematic Social Media Use in Adolescence as Possible Mechanisms of Change in Psychotherapy].
doc78	2	Mediators of Problematic Social Media Use in Adolescence as Possible Mechanisms of Change in Psychotherapy Social media are omnipresent in the lives of adolescents.
doc78	3	Problematic use of social media has been linked to adverse mental health outcomes including depression, anxiety, suicidality, self-harm, body dissatisfaction and eating pathology.
doc78	4	Preliminary evidence suggests that interventions aiming at reducing the amount of time spent in social media and changing dysfunctional beliefs about social media use are promising.
doc78	5	However, the mechanisms of change of these interventions with regard to mental health remain unclear.
doc78	6	Therefore, this review first provides an overview of the association between social media and mental health and then identifies mediators of this relationship as potential mechanisms of change of interventions targeting problematic media use in adolescents.
doc78	7	The identified mediators encompass social comparison, decreased self-esteem, fear of missing out, sleep problems and increased rumination.
doc78	8	Future studies should apply a longitudinal design, should investigate additional confounding variables (e. g. age, level of psychopathology) and should also focus on positive effects of social media use on mental health.
doc78	9	Thereby, this line of research has the potential to improve our understanding how social media use exerts its effects and based thereupon to develop new or optimize current interventions on problematic social media use to improve mental health in adolescents by targeting the identified mediators.

doc80	1	[The Future of Vascular Medicine - Role of 3D Printing].
doc80	2	Digitalisation is one of the key challenges in current surgery and will impact the future of surgical care as well as upcoming generations of surgeons.
doc80	3	3D printing is a technology that has recently been transferred from industrial prototyping into cardiovascular medicine.
doc80	4	The digital model of the anatomical structure which needs to be engineered represents the inherent link of 3D printing to digital medicine.
doc80	5	3D printing technology is able to provide the surgeon with patient-specific models of anatomy and disease for surgical planning and patient informed consent as well as training templates for students and residents, surgical templates and even ready-to-use surgical implants.
doc80	6	In our service, we have established a full-inhouse workflow for 3D printing and we currently use this technology for the generation of patient-specific models, training templates and for patient education, as will be presented in this article.
doc80	7	Future advances in software solutions, printing polymers and easy-to-handle printers will further propagate and expand the applicability of this technology in cardiovascular medicine.
doc81	1	[Expert Recommendation for the Implementation of Hyperthermic Intrathoracic Chemotherapy (HITOC) in Germany].
doc81	2	INTRODUCTION
doc81	3	During the last few years, hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy (HITOC) has been performed in several departments for thoracic surgery in Germany.
doc81	4	The objective of this expert recommendation is to provide elementary recommendations for a standardised HITOC treatment, which are based on clinical experiences and research data.
doc81	5	METHODS
doc81	6	Between October and December 2018, a group of experts for thoracic surgery in five departments of thoracic surgery developed recommendations for the HITOC procedure in Germany.
doc81	7	These experts were selected by the latest national survey for HITOC and had the most clinical experience with HITOC.
doc81	8	All recommendations are based on clinical experience, the experts' research data and recent literature.
doc81	9	RESULTS
doc81	10	All recommendations were evaluated by all participating departments in one consensus survey.
doc81	11	Finally, a total of six main conclusions including a total of 17 recommendations were developed.
doc81	12	For each recommendation, the strength of the consensus is presented in percentages. 100% agreement was established for nomenclature, technique, the chemotherapeutic agent, the perioperative management, the safety measures and the indications for HITOC.
doc81	13	All experts recommended cisplatin as the first choice chemotherapeutic agent for HITOC.
doc81	14	The dosage of cisplatin is specified in mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) and should be between 150 and 175 mg/m2 BSA.
doc81	15	The volume of the perfusion fluid (approximately 4 - 5 l) seems to play a role for the concentration gradient of cisplatin and should therefore also be taken into account.
doc81	16	CONCLUSIONS
doc81	17	These expert recommendations provide a standardised and consistent implementation of the HITOC procedure.
doc81	18	On this basis, postoperative complications associated to HITOC should be reduced and comparison of the results should be improved.
doc82	1	Parenting self-efficacy in the context of poverty and HIV in Eastern Uganda: A qualitative study.
doc82	2	We sought to understand social representations of effective parenting and parenting self-efficacy among female HIV-affected caregivers in rural Eastern Uganda.
doc82	3	We conducted in-depth interviews (n = 21) to describe parenting experiences and caregivers' perceptions of their own parenting abilities and to create vignettes for use in directed focus groups.
doc82	4	We carried out open focus groups (n = 2) to gain social perspectives on parenting, and directed focus groups (n = 2) concentrated on parenting self-efficacy.
doc82	5	Analysis involved memoing and inductive and deductive coding of transcripts.
doc82	6	Caregivers' perceptions of their own parenting were grounded in parenting values such as providing children with basic needs, having well-behaved children, and having good relationships with children.
doc82	7	Caregivers' perceptions were influenced by challenges, including single parenthood, living with HIV, limited family resources, and mental health problems.
doc82	8	When facing challenges, caregivers relied on social support and faith as well as their own parenting confidence.
doc82	9	Caregivers' perceptions of their parenting abilities were influenced by how they felt others perceived them, their satisfaction in the parenting role, their perseverance despite challenges, and the extent to which they had a vision for their family.
doc82	10	Our findings contextualize parenting self-efficacy within parenting values, challenges, and social perceptions among HIV-affected caregivers in rural Uganda.
doc89	1	Air quality in the operating room: Surgical site infections, HVAC systems and discipline - position paper of the German Society of Hospital Hygiene (DGKH).
doc89	2	In recent years, there has been an ongoing discussion about the value of laminar airflow (LAF=low turbulence displacement ventilation) in the operating room for prevention of surgical site infections (SSI).
doc89	3	Some publications, e.g., from the WHO, issued the demand to no longer build LAF ceilings in operating rooms.
doc89	4	The present statement deals critically with this position and justifies the use of LAF ceilings in different ways: Many of the papers cited by the WHO and others for the case against LAF do not provide reliable data.
doc89	5	The remaining studies which might be used for answering the question give quite different results, also in favor of LAF.The size of the LAF ceiling in many studies is not given or mostly too small in comparison to actual technical requirements.LAF in different countries can mean quite different techniques (e.g., the US in comparison to Germany) so that the results of studies that do not take this into account may not be comparable.LAF has positive effects in terms of reducing particulate and bacterial load, associated with increased airflow in the surgical working area.
doc89	6	A reduction of carcinogenic substances in the air may also be assumed, which would increase workers' safety.
doc89	7	Thus, this paper recommends building LAF ceilings in the future as well, depending on the operations intended.
doc89	8	Further, this paper gives an overview of possible reasons for surgical site infections and highlights the importance of discipline in the operating theatre.
doc9	1	Comparison of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound as Diagnostic Options for Unclear Cystic Renal Lesions: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.
doc9	2	PURPOSE
doc9	3	Correct differentiation between malignant and benign incidentally found cystic renal lesions has critical implications for patient management.
doc9	4	In several studies contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) showed higher sensitivity with respect to the accurate characterization of these lesions compared to MRI, but the cost-effectiveness of CEUS has yet to be investigated.
doc9	5	The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of CEUS as an alternative imaging method to MRI for the characterization of incidentally found cystic renal lesions.
doc9	6	MATERIALS AND METHODS
doc9	7	A decision model including the diagnostic modalities MRI and CEUS was created based on Markov simulations estimating lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
doc9	8	The recent literature was reviewed to obtain model input parameters.
doc9	9	The deterministic sensitivity of diagnostic parameters and costs was determined and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte-Carlo Modelling was applied.
doc9	10	Willingness-to-pay (WTP) was assumed to be $ 100 000/QALY.
doc9	11	RESULTS
doc9	12	In the base-case scenario, the total costs for CEUS were $9654.43, whereas the total costs for MRI were $9675.03. CEUS resulted in an expected effectiveness of 8.06 QALYs versus 8.06 QALYs for MRI.
doc9	13	Therefore, from an economic point of view, CEUS was identified as an adequate diagnostic alternative to MRI.
doc9	14	Sensitivity analysis showed that results may vary if CEUS costs increase or those of MRI decrease.
doc9	15	CONCLUSION
doc9	16	Based on the results of the analysis, the use of CEUS was identified as a cost-effective diagnostic strategy for the characterization of incidentally found cystic renal lesions.
doc90	1	[Preperitoneal Umbilical Hernia Mesh Plasty (PUMP): Indications, Technique and Results].
doc90	2	BACKGROUND
doc90	3	The principle of the preperitoneal umbilical mesh plasty (PUMP) technique is placement of the prosthesis in the extraperitoneal space, posterior to the rectus muscles, followed by ventral fascia closure.
doc90	4	Difficulties can arise from preperitoneal dissection, mesh insertion, deployment, and positioning.
doc90	5	METHODS
doc90	6	81 elective patients underwent preperitoneal repair of primary umbilical or epigastric hernias sized from 2 - 4 cm between January 2015 and March 2018 and were prospectively collected in the Herniamed database and retrospectively analysed.
doc90	7	The same general technique was applied, but over time three different types of mesh devices were used.
doc90	8	The experience from these cases and the gradual change between the implants during the observation period is described in this study.
doc90	9	RESULTS
doc90	10	No intraoperative complications were recorded.
doc90	11	Postoperative complications occurred in 6 of 81 patients (7.4%) with the need for unplanned re-operation in 3 cases.
doc90	12	Seventy-six of 81 patients (93.8%) attended the one year follow-up evaluation.
doc90	13	Three of 76 patients (3.9%) suffered recurrence and five patients (6.6%) requires treatment for chronic pain.
doc90	14	CONCLUSION
doc90	15	Surgeons must work with the implant that best suits their patients' needs and that also provides good results and adequate working comfort.
doc90	16	The PUMP technique performs well for ventral hernias sized between 2 and 4 cm without the need of midline reconstruction due to diastasis of the rectus muscles.
doc90	17	It enables a local extraperitoneal mesh augmentation without the risk of intraperitoneal complications.
doc90	18	PUMP repair lowers the risk of recurrence in comparison with suture repair without increasing the risk of complications.
doc94	1	[Horizon Scanning in Health Care: A German Perspective].
doc94	2	BACKGROUND
doc94	3	Decision makers in health care act in an area in which expectations increase to make beneficial new technologies available as soon as possible, to protect patients from unsafe or ineffective technologies, and to expedite or decelerate technology diffusion.
doc94	4	Horizon Scanning (HS) is a process to identify early new and emerging technologies and to inform about their potential consequences concerning the health care system.
doc94	5	OBJECTIVES
doc94	6	Methods of HS, worldwide existing activities and the status quo in Germany are described.
doc94	7	METHODS
doc94	8	In April 2015, a systematic electronic search was conducted which was supplemented by hand searching.
doc94	9	Additionally, a qualitative acquisition of German expert knowledge in health care was realized.
doc94	10	RESULTS
doc94	11	27 formal HS systems (HSS) worldwide were identified of which 18 are current members of the "International Information Network on New and Emerging Health Technologies".
doc94	12	Essentially, the same process steps are applied but there may be differences in methods due to different structures and interests of the health care systems.
doc94	13	There is no official HSS in Germany.
doc94	14	The survey of experts revealed a lack of knowledge and a varying understanding of HS, but basically there seems to be a need for this.
doc94	15	CONCLUSIONS
doc94	16	The systematic process of HS can be adapted to current circumstances and objectives of a specific health care system and has international acceptance.
doc94	17	In Germany, it could enable decision makers and other stakeholders to have information early and thus support them in their decisions.
