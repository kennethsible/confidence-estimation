Food is to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the inflation rate measured in the euro area is the soaring food prices.
In the 13 countries in the euro area, the inflation rate in November was higher than expected - after the 2.6% in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1% was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were based on only 3%, and bloomberg was reported.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key rate and it is their opinion that interest rate reductions would encourage rising commodity prices and a slight reduction in unemployment to lead to inflation spiralling.
The ECB is trying to keep inflation below 2%, or at least close to the 2% mark.
According to an analysts, the ECB is in the trick of 'avoiding inflation' in order to prevent further action.
At 3.3%, inflation in Germany reached 12% per year in November; in Spain, the rate was between 3.6% and 4.1%.
The increase in inflation in the euro area is due to the increase in food and energy prices.
MATIF-wheat censuses increased by 88% and the rate for soya beans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in the price of oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world price of crude oil rose this year by 52% - last month the price per band of the black gold reached almost USD 100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1% to 2.5% in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9% in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months analysts are working on a 3% rate of inflation, but the average annual rate is 2.1%.
Experts expect the ECB to lower interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup against a government crisis
After a long stamping, the number of Fidesz sympathisers increased considerably by the beginning of December, and for the first time since 2002 the party has had the largest base camp, while the Socialist Group's vote, according to Gallup, reached an unprecedented low of 13%.
The difference is clear among the party leaders, thanks to the strong determination of those in favour of the opposition: more than two thirds (71%) are in favour of a fifth (20%) MSZP.
MDF and SDZ are, according to the survey, below the parliamentary entry barrier: they reach 2% of the population as a whole.
The number of party members has increased by 1% in both camps.
Compared with the last low, the general economic climate has deteriorated even further - never before has the proportion of those who regard the country's economic situation as' extremely poor 'been so high (41%), while a further 46% consider it to be' quite bad '.
After more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about changing their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population expect the situation to deteriorate further; only a tenth expect it to improve.
A Gallupat survey in December showed that 71% of those questioned - a historical hook - considered the work of the Prime Minister to be 'rather poor than wrong'.
Thirteen per cent of those questioned have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the 'yes' vote for Viktor Orbán is 38%.
Around 54% do not trust the Head of Government at all, compared with 27% of the government's party leader, in distrust of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of people who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be overcome even without a change of government.
If, after the unrest last October, 35% had declared themselves in favour of the government and the Heads of Government remaining, this figure now stands at only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
If asked for their interest in the referendum, 60% replied that they would 'certainly' participate and a further 20% would 'probably' vote.
By way of comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55% would go to the ballot boxes' with certainty ', and a further 15% would consider their participation' likely ', and in view of these trends the referendum would have a predictable result.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practical fee and 84% against the hospital allowance.
If the group of 'certainly' participants in the referendum were to be included, the proportion of those who oppose study, practical and hospital fees would be as high as 81, 84 or 89%.
Auchan the most expensive, Tesco the size of almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörser trading area have this year also maintained the average increase in the price of 16% last year, with the difference that there has been no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser Triangle, the price of the Napi's normal Christmas basin has increased by 16% this year as well, but in all hypermarkets price increases of over 1 000 HUF have been recorded.
After the 'davongalkali' prices on the food markets last December, the price rate has not been very high in percentage terms compared with the already high, earlier level.
However, it is a deterrent to consumers that what they had paid for in the last year, well below FUF 9 000, is not available even for HUF 10 000 this year.
The price of the 'Napi' grades of goods exceeds the magic 100-HUF border by at least 91 HUF in the markets under examination.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800, the price was at 6800 HUF)
The prices of Unicum and living fish were close to last year's level, but the prices of turf-break fillets, fos and poppies have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread were in line with data from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, but in Auchan there were 1 kg of bread arches for 139 forints.
There was no competitive fall in prices to less than 200 pints.
Also surprising was the price of two litres of Coca-Cola Pfandflasche under 200 forint, so the beverage, including deposits, only cost 257 HUF.
However, this year's most expensive difference was the Auchan product's' Napi 'comparison, and Cora.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the Napi basket by 15% compared with the Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have each increased by 18%.
The difference between last year's cheapest basket and today's most expensive one was 12%, while the increase between last year's cheapest basket and the most expensive one was 21% for the current year.
The average price increase was 1 480.00 HUF.
Last year's average price increase was 1 206.00 Forint, but the VAT increase at last Christmas prices was noticeable.
This is exactly what has hit the trade hard: it seems that the stores have not been able to decide quite clearly what price margin they should apply to the various articles, since the impact of the price increase on consumer behaviour was incalculable.
(If the trader does not plan the circulation speed of a product well, he may fall within the bounds of the road traffic intensity by making substantial profits)
The MDM tax rate inflation last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the 2006 value by 1720 forint, while the price differential in the cheapest basket was only 844.
This year, extremes of this kind were not observed, as the most expensive body cost 1.630.00 more than last year, and even the cheapest one had an increase in prices of 1.284.00.
Compared with the two last Christmas seasons, prices rose dramatically, and the price of everyday consumer goods in hypermarkets rose by more than 30% in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data from the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office established a more than 30% increase over 12 months.
So in more or less the same way as meal, for eggs.)
However, when you look at the 'napi' basket, it seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the product, which was already expensive last year, has even risen by barely more than 10% at worst.
It is clear that pole-keepers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - they were able to pass the drastic price increase on to the multinationals.
In the golden trade triangle, hypermarkets do not complain; good years are constantly being reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three stores no longer look at prices.
Large quantities are being purchased, and durable food goes through the counter in palette.
On Wednesday morning morning, there were endless queues at Kassa in all three product centres, when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, the country reports a lower number of customers, so many multinationals complain to opinion scientists that they cannot even achieve the planned turnover, not only in food but also in sustainable consumer goods.
In many places disinfectants are saved.
Today, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals, which were due to incorrect use of antibiotics.
Hygiene conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overburdening of staff - all factors which do not help to contain the infections - are the leading doctor of the National Epidemiological Centre.
In many places, disinfectants are also being saved.
A MRSA infection was recently diagnosed in the János Hospital trauma department.
Bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was hospitalised after a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection here.
The injured person in a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly afterwards the man had to return with an MRSA infection, and an important operation has not yet been carried out since then because of the bacterium that is still in the patient's body.
By 10 December this year, 1094 infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the NCA Surveillance System from hospitals, such as the leading doctor of the National Epidemiological Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, but the number of unreported cases should be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by the MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus, which is resistant to methicillin-Oxacillin.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) carries about a third of the people in their noses without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as half-fling, almonium, skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are good for cure.
However, if the funds are overbudgeted or used improperly, the good correspondents of bacteria will result in antibiotic resistant genes, which will spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
In particular, for patients with weakened or permanently inefficient immune systems, but also in older or low body patients, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as gun-infections or blood poisoning, or Sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, MRSA infection is not special, such incidents are part of everyday sick leave.
We must not confuse infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned that MRSA does not exist only where it is not sought.
Resistance to antibiotics
'Such patients are isolated, the carers are wearing rubber shoes and masks in their care and we have the antibiotics needed to treat them '- Tibor Nyulasi.
When they are admitted to hospital, patients are examined on MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Surveys are too rare.
The majority of infections in hospitals caused by MRSA would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable to curbing the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant agent, says Karolina Börcz.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and old age homes, the sponsors should investigate the patients who have been sent in and immediately isolate those infected by MRSA.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not practised so often.
Not least because there is no subsidy from the state health insurance fund for this investigation.
Most cases would therefore only come to light when the patient has already had a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the doctor head of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has made strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but Hungary too has directives on the treatment of certain infections and pathologies.
Antibiotic treatments should be targeted, which means that microbiological tests are necessary to prevent resistance to the product, but this directive from hospitals is not always complied with.
Microbial sampling is even more rare among patients, or those on basic care, as Karolina Börcz puts it.
Disinfectious agents
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transferred from one patient to another by care staff.
This is precisely why handwashing, or the wearing of gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there are also major deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by cremation or contact, but in domestic hospitals there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, and beds are almost matured, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz continues to point out, even in hospitals with less financial resources, there are few depositors, many patients - all factors that actually encourage the emergence of infections.
It is evident that these infections are far less frequent in the country, or that the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are being observed, as Karolina Böröcz has said.
Government programme against MRSA
Tackling MRA infections is costing medical insurance a great deal, so they are being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, MRSA prevention, or halting it, has been included in the government programme.
The programme is successful at first sight - according to published data, the trend of MRSA infection in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has made prevention of multi-resistant resistants (including MRSA) and prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Carrod Chief of Death Penalty
In the case of a fatal car accident, which was caused by the chief of police of XXII, the official report is now available.
The now resigned police chief of XXII, counted on Tuesday who killed a pedestrian in a car accident, was neither alcoholic nor drug-driven, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor's Office, who was on Friday after the official opinion was presented on the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the chief of police did not use alcohol before he took the wheel.
The former chief of police bow his own car in XXII, wandering around the Kossuth Lajos Street, passing a 55-year-old man crossing the road in an unmarked place.
(According to the StVO, however, this is not a mitigating factor - the driver has a suitcase, even if pedestrians do not cross the road at the wheel's floor.)
The pedestrian has been injured after being admitted to hospital.
According to police reports, the driver was shocked, then withdrew his functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor has launched her investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Chief of Police has cooperated with the investigators from the outset.
A further EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements worth EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday, and this money is to be channelled into education, transport and environmental protection infrastructure and energy industry.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a EUR 300 million framework for financing transport and environmental projects carried out with grants from the Cohesion Fund, the credit contract of EUR 100 million having been signed earlier, the current agreement being about the use of the EUR 200 million lost.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also to be used for the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has allocated a total of EUR 300 million to Hungary for this purpose; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later on in the context of the extension of the credit contract.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be channelled into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The meeting also discussed the underground line 4.
It was agreed that once Hungary had clarified the details of the underground financing with the EU, the original Treaty and possible modifications would be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The interest rates are linked to EURIBOR, and the loan is made available by the EIB with an eight-year delay, without a provisional period.
Bulgaria, EU property paradise
The development of the Bulgarian property market is fantastic - the whole of Europe is looking carefully at the Balkan state, which was rarely mentioned earlier.
Where, and who buys the EU's still cheapest market, but it is becoming more expensive quickly?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re / Max Division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular asset for property purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap skiing and sea houses.
Between the mountains, the Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular; the sea is Albena, the 'gold coast', the 'sunflower', and the historic cities of Sozopol and Nessebar are the racers, but property around Kavarna and Balcik is increasingly needed.
According to the estimates of Re / Max analysts in Bulgaria, the country's internal investors will also, sooner or later, attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena and Triavna, and the very favourable region of Russe also has more buyers.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive offers - commercial and office areas offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive European gold paraes, and thus, in addition to the summer and winter seasons, it is also able to attract tourists in the other two seasons.
Preventing investors are therefore already buying in large quantities, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying property in Bulgaria also want to see a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while in the Black Sea and the ski areas there are mainly Russian buyers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, as Georgij Jankov says, regional director of Re / Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle either buy revitalised property by EUR 50 100 000, or ruined houses by EUR 5 15 000, which they themselves then renovate.
Good access, accessibility and communication are important, but proximity to a city, business and doctors are also crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those seeking a holiday bomb (Bulgaria was listed under the top ten German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is business people who invest with the aim of increasing value in the medium to long term.
Buildings in the capital are, however, constantly becoming more expensive, due to the constantly increasing demand.
In the EU, property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but over the past five years there has been a 21% increase in prices per year.
The increase in property prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As the Environment Minister Gábor Fodor has indicated, the meetings of experts will end on Tuesday and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali road map, which sets out the emission-reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
A heated debate is currently under way between developed and developing countries.
The US has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate on concrete figures, but it would be prepared to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared with 1990.
The other major question at the conference is whether the industrialised countries are prepared to support the developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement has also been reached on aid to developing countries.
The Adjustment Fund, which is subject to the Kyoto Protocol, is to be managed by a Council of 16 members, probably at the UN Global Environmental Facility (GEF), as is evident from the UN Piac és Profit.
Hungary's 6%
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for the Environment, Gábor Fodor, supports the EU's ambition to maintain its leading role in global climate protection measures and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (compared with 1990 levels), regardless of whether or not the post-2012 agreement was successfully achieved, and that the Union would be prepared to commit itself to a 30% reduction, as well as other major industrialised countries in the world, or developing countries, which are also prepared to honour their commitments as much as possible and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the EU, with its 15 Member States at the time, had already committed itself to a reduction of 8%.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with 1985-87, a target which the country will certainly meet, as the Environment Ministry press release indicates.
The commitment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be ready within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until after 2012, and in this case the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed by a new, international emissions reduction system, the importance of which was also highlighted in the recent report by the IPCC, the UN's international Climate Change Committee, which is excellent with the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay the reduction in emissions and increase the average temperature of the planet by more than 2 ° C would be unavoidable, with extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to the scientists.
British army is promoting YouTube
British army units have published records of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British air force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: special units stationed in Afghanistan have been filling videos on the Net against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The recordings carried on helmets are checked at the Chandahar air base and then sent to London, where they are posted on the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
Outside the air force, 139 have already contributed such recordings, and their 'Channel' has been seen more than 75 000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered in spring 2007 under the Defence Defence Thai City to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the Commonwealth Office and the international peace-keeping forces in Iraq also have their own YouTubet channels.
Action in Afghanistan
Originally, the air force has videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers and, as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of the foreign missions.
Such propaganda is almost free of charge compared with traditional television advertising, such defence experts Gordon Mackenzie on the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, since they confirm the raison d 'être of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
American advertising with gamble
However, the army must also fight against amateur takeovers which, in addition to the carefully processed, censored recordings, also create it on the Internet - such as those which show the deaths of soldiers: the rather hypocritical 'official' propaganda films only talk about the losses, but do not show the bloody sides of the war.
In fact, many videos used have already been put on the platform from the war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British have only recently discovered this' genesis' for themselves.
The Americans are advertising in a somewhat different way, with the 'American-Army' shootout free of charge, in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin in in the form of a more or less lively simulation.
Christmas celebration of Tombola and Pogatsche in ministries
The Minister for Labour, Mónika Lamperth, is not a soft man: instead of a Christmas parade, she is organising a working conference at which her staff can have coffee and pogatic spell out the year 2007.
Some ministries celebrate life music, others are prey to a Christmas mood of tombola or an aspiring to the official authorities.
Party, Christmas mood, concert and Buffet - that is how power is celebrated.
The Christmas fever has already grasped the offices.
The biggest Christmas parade of a ministry is being held in the defence portfolio today, but that is not what the Ministry's staff are expected to do.
At the Christmas festive of the orphans, children are being distracted by soldiers who have fallen, the 'missionary' group hits members of soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department provides around 25 million for the festivities.
Compared with other portfolios, the National Development Agency (NFCs) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport are overloading the waters.
The 432 million Christmas celebrations of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which are being held in the House of the future, are expected to be some 350 out of 600 employees.
The celebrations are focused on Christmas, but there will also be Live Acts and a tombola link.
The National Agency for Development (NFCT) held its 4.7 million World Forint Prizewinner on Wednesday in the House of the Council of State Justice (OIT), with concert and a festival.
The hall was 1 million Forint, and the rest was spent on the 400 visitors invited.
According to our information, a NFC department is also invited at another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MGG Clobe) from EU funds.
The celebration saw the sweetening of the building of the Lustasball theatre (Vígszínház).
The MGG has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the people responsible.
Why the train?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFC, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to OIT to use the premises.
Some 500 visitors arrived on the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a Minister's address, and after dinner there was a live music.
In response to a request from [origo], it was said that there was no obligation on the ball to dress or to train.
The health, work and self-government ministries are preparing for puritan celebrations.
The Ministry of Health is organising a ceremony for its own four walls for some 400 000 forints.
The Minister for Labour, Mónika Lamperth, officially invites her staff not to be a Christmas celebration but to attend the conference for the end of the year.
According to the press department, some 180 guests are being charged with coffee and pogatashes, and the celebration is estimated at 350 000.
The Minister for Self-Government, Gordon Bajnai, will be kicked in with his colleagues simply in the Ministry's Aula.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is holding a Christmas celebration in its own theatre, with 436 people expected to attend it.
The expenditure was calculated at 2 500 forints per head - there is a buffet reception for that money, followed by kick-starting.
Since János Veres began his term of office, the PM staff have been celebrating in this way every year.
However, there will be no real party-political mood, not only because of the official speech by the Minister, but also because the celebration has been scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites a New Year's reception on 20 January, and the Ministry's Christmas celebration is this time coming.
The one hundred guests in Vajdahunyad castle in the town park (Városliget) are being asked; according to the department, expenditure is estimated at 1 000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple staging, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions that are organised every year traditionally start with a brief address by the minister and sound with a modest toll.
As the relevant press points point out in [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebrations either at the Foreign Office or at the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the cost of Christmas celebrations, the Ministry of the Environment's press department was unable to provide any information.
In any case, over 400 guests have been invited to the ceremony organised in the art world.
More and more forces are being mobilised for huge strikes
On Friday, the League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation will form their coordinating committee for the indefinite strike that begins on Monday.
A protest assembly is to be held on Saturday, and on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the working time begins.
There are also strikes, significant traffic obstacles, as rail transport is almost completely discontinued, and the Budapest public transport companies (BCV) are also on strike until 13 p.m.
The details of Monday's strike will be jointly announced on Friday afternoon by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions.
A LIGA - MOSZ Strike Committee - is also being set up, which is responsible for coordinating action on Monday.
A protest assembly will be held on Saturday and, from Monday, all organisations that have joined the strike will stop work indefinitely unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike started on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act has not been defined.
Should the National Council not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss how to proceed.
On Monday's agenda, it is even conceivable that the vote on the Health Insurance Act will not be taken until later hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes starting on Monday will have to be expected to create significant obstacles to traffic: railway workers will be laid off indefinitely, the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán-type companies will be left silent on the morning.
At the same time, there will be a direction in many places in the motorway blocks.
Many trade unions and civil organisations have responded to the call for strike, and the list of participants is constantly updated on the league website.
Some organisations have announced strikes indefinitely, others are planning temporary work.
Until Thursday afternoon, agreement could not be reached on sufficient services between the Hungarian Railway Railway Railway MÁV and the Free Railway Union of the VDSZ, even though more and more people are travelling by rail around Christmas Day.
According to reports to date, the COBE is being attacked from the start to the night of 13, while Budapest Airport is being attacked from 7 to 9 a.m., the LIGA unions for electricity and heat power are working for four hours and the teachers' union, for example, has called for two or 2-8 hours strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association is striking at various times, alternatively, on a number of national occasions, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers, an underorganisation of the SZF, the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points requested by the League is that the government withdraw the draft health insurance reform and come up with a new concept for social discourse.
The second demand concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension scheme, which will be due from next year.
The third requirement is that the eligible professions be given access to the early pension system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZ, which is a member of the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer made by the Ministry of Transport concerning the secondary lines and is now calling for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases state risk
The Risk Analysis Division department of political Capital believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the 'Movement for a Better Hungary', have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's Risk Alert Report states, among other things, that, in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is' exacerbating the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-Gypsies in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term '.
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably intended to provoke such a dispute, according to the research institute.
As is reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of political leaders: 'Public figures have left discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups, who have now built their political strategy on the Roma Hungarian opposition'.
It is suspected that this would exacerbate the problem, make it impossible to have a proper dialogue, foster extremes and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The Research Institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention paid by the domestic and foreign media, 'have significantly damaged Hungary's image abroad, particularly as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity'.
We remember that since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been steadily on the increase, with the result that several 'national self-defence organisations' have been established since summer 2007.
'What these groups have in common is that they define themselves as civil organisations, while openly boasting about preparing their members for defence tasks - sometimes armed - (civil protection, defence, law enforcement), invoking the ineffectiveness of the police, the army, or the state itself '.
And, furthermore, all this is in line with the method of trying to disguise various political aspirations based on the disenchantment of the people, which are political and party in nature.
The emphasis on the civil nature and form of association is not just a way of circumventing the legal obstacles that might arise from registration in court - it is also a political strategy.
The analysis shows that the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a risky factor, including in relations with neighbouring countries.
'In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, while some ultranationalist politicians in certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as confirming its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region '.
From the point of view of the research institute, the foundation of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, and the political risk for the entire region has increased.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the extreme right-wing Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The emergence of the Bulgarian Guard has been the background to the mass Roma riots that have taken place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU immediately took the events as an opportunity to establish the National Guard, arguing that the aim of organising 'national protection' was.
In fact, they believe that, over the last 17 years, a veritable 'Gypsy terror' has been seen in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent - that is to say, political capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have sparked a heated debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that they will set up their own garden for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far been similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma are also responding to threats by organising their own protection, as stated in the Risk Alert Report by Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, the director of research into political capital, said at the request of the news office that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually and, if risk-changing trends were to be identified, public opinion would be informed, as in the case of the risk assessment report.
Forms are not all holiday days.
In Hungary, public holidays are regulated by law, so the practice of rescheduling working days around the festive season has now become established, but next year brings us fewer such days.
In the EU and America, too, we understand something different by 'festive day'.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state festivities and working days.
Working days are mostly church holidays or are linked to important historical events.
For example, we are celebrating New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are free days - the latter alone, so that the New Year celebrations can rest.
We have a total of 14 public holidays all year round.
The State Day is 15 March, which is reminiscent of the 1848 revolution, and 23 October, which was the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August, the founding of a state, the work of which will be celebrated on 1 May, will be commemorated on 1 and 2 November.
Moreover, there are two days of celebration for Easter, Pfinest, and Christmas.
As our national, national or religious holidays rarely reach one weekend, the practice of 'working day postponement' has proved its worth in cases where we would only work one day before or after the day of the festive season.
However, the price of extended weekends is that we do indeed have to work on the Saturday preceding that, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, will finally be over, has been laid down by the Employment Minister in a separate regulation for many years.
The legislation applies to all employers and customers, public servants and public servants alike.
Only firms and establishments that operate without interruption, including on public holidays, are excluded.
Today, the working order is only somewhat confused by the New Year's festive season: life will remain here from 24 December, since most people will take the holidays between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the holidays specially declared for them.
More public holidays are going to be held in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer rewards on working days than this year.
The calendar is first 'turned on its head' around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days at the same time.
Saturday, 26 April will be a working day so that Friday, 2 May can be a day of rest.
The second redeployment is linked to the public holiday of 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, we will have to complete the work in advance of Friday, 24 October.
However, the end of the year will be completely marked by a festive season, after everything has been and will remain as of 24 December, even if New Year falls on a Wednesday.
Six dissuasive minor matters to disappoint colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never get - innocent lies that no longer make us realise: they 'colour' in everyday life at work.
The question is simply whether we are used to these small inconveniences or whether we are better prepared to face the challenge and deliberately avoid them for other angry situations.
Tipps.
'Sorry, I forgot to explain that someone has called from the marketing department '- says a colleague.
That they have failed to produce a meeting?
At best, it is regretted and tries to make good it, perhaps by calling on the marketing department and by being remiss, by forgetting to send the message (that is the less common method).
In most cases, it is a matter of apology.
Before being bogged down in embarrassing excuses, we should consider what we can do to make unpleasant moments for our colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
What do you not have?
There is little more nervous than using a document, a courtyard or a telephone, but it is not there.
Yesterday, the hdog was still on the desk - this morning it has disappeared?
Or is the coined bogus trawler discovered on a colleague's desk?
There is no question about the Members borrowing, because they are rightly annoyed when they discover that something has gone away.
So, let us not put cake or post-it from the office in the pocket, because it could affect one: no more, if you need it urgently.
Is it about the private lives of colleagues?
There is no effective way of stopping a divisive situation that has already been created.
Who does what with whom?
Where and why?
If possible, we should not make the information (or guess) about the private lives of our colleagues binding on everyone!
And if someone is going to open up and tell us his inner secrets, we should not abuse that trust!
The best way to keep quiet is to keep quiet like a grave, rather than to target those who are not here at the moment, even if others know about the problems of the honourable Member.
Is it not for reasons that I have been notified ill?
When you call in the office to register ill because you feel uncomfortable or just want to rest, you should be clear about one thing: your own work, unstoppable commitments, fixed deadlines are now the responsibility of colleagues rather than of you.
So, do not play with colleagues unfairly!
If you know on the previous day that you will not get it into office the next day, or that something could happen, so that you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither colleagues nor the boss are suddenly faced with absenteeism.
Heaven, poisoning, telephone calls
We are in the process of deepening our work, but are the noisy poet of our colleagues suddenly disrupted?
Is it not deliberate to listen to a telephone call that it would have been better not to hear?
You should not induce colleagues to be nervous with sums, stars, talk (which is conducted over their heads), wheelchairs, endless shambles or bullets.
All this can be very disturbing, even if it is not exactly a task (written, planned, organised) to deepen.
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed within the deadline, we have forgotten to send an important letter or important offspring, and we should not seek the blame of one's own forgetfulness from others!
If possible, we should not talk about chaos in the office or the noisy Members!
The best way to admit their mistakes is to apologise if others have been affected.
The question of how to make up for the error or to make good the omission is all too relevant.
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training-shose and sleep: convenient for home, but lost nothing in the office!
Not even then should we be so cared for when the job actually allows!
But do not get too silly - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress in the office - if you want, be good and elegant!
Everyone is right to want to do it - or how is it not interesting for others?
Stop and go, the car in the middle of the mortal congestion.
There is a strange story from the radio: the whim of a vulge, coupled with electronic effects.
I would be more vociferous.
The pace is changing, the bass is on the table, and a female chorus is a real gem.
It is the song 'Wings of Love' from Zagar that is hanging on mr2.
The indigenous music cousin has not exactly got us into a habit of quality Electropop for a long time.
But now even the congestion is viewed differently, when you hear the new Album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting products from the domestic digital underground scene, is slowly changing the overall picture and, even if the garagenrock is back to 'in' with its gitarrenticeship, the domestic Electropop is proving that there are new things under the sun.
Balázs Zságer began in Pécs, simulated himself in the Band Yonderboi, before he started his own way, perhaps because a shouse does not carry two keys.
However, he did not make the breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which combines elements from Jazz, Electronic and Pop, until he was approached with a request to add the soundtrack to a film (for example)
Ferenc Török's' Szezon '.
The formations that had initially appeared in smaller clubs became public knowledge only when the magazine 'van2' counted its first album from 2002 under the top 50 indigenous algae and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, almost the only Trendure Sabbrew that can also be marketed in the West.
Doubtless Zagar and his band were 'trendy', but it was not interested whether they were happy to wear it.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better, album.
The new Album that has now been published, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, could open up new paths for them, but the title itself expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécare years.
The expression was in fact born when Balázs Zságer was still on a different path.
The lucid, avenging allusion would be fine, but apart from the atheral nature of music, the louder shittle, the rock 'n 'roll, which is in line with the spirit of the times and trends, is also striking.
These are the loved ones that the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band The Puzzle, presented to the first in the Millenáris.
A song from Album has even managed to reach the radio butcher - the mr2 Petőfi, which has been sent from early to late, has gradually put a deaf ear to the listeners with the number 'Wings of Love', which has been taken in with the participation of six indigenous singers (Underground Divas).
So, all right (?)
Hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
Hvg.hu: this new hate raises the question: to what extent do your music remain reserved for a certain section?
Balázs Zságer: the term 'historical music' does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two castles in the Popmusics, not mainstream and Underground, or alternative and post, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be easy and meaningless, but it can only be produced for sale, which makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also be created for an honest reason.
The listening attitude also works on this principle, regardless of languages and national borders.
Hgg.hu: do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign public to your music?
For example, Zs: abroad, and especially in the West of us, the pop music has a greater tradition.
It is not only teenagers or twens who are on concerts, but also the elderly public.
They are following the trends in the pop music that are going around them much more closely, because they consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: what role does the public have in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many of your music?
For two reasons: of course it is a good feeling to see more and more of our concert coming.
We have never, however, framed the market.
We do not have music to serve a purpose, but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is generally felt in concert, where there is already mutual interaction, but this is only the case in the unmatching changes of the moment.
However, one thing struck me: if you want to please everyone, you will no longer be interesting.
Hgg.hu: how far will you go in the way of the example of Yonderboi?
He is a soldier and has built his career more in the West.
Let me give you two examples: we are not really going down the road, quite apart from the constant attempts to interpret this in our music.
We see ourselves as a team player, relying on each other's musical presence and allowing it to develop.
At the outset, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us have gone out of our own way and gone down a different path.
Hvg.hu: in the Charts of mr2 Petőfi, 'Wings of Love' is the first.
Many people heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening up deliberately arranged with a somewhat more popular style towards a broader public?
For example, we had no plans to write a hit which would then be used as a train for the album.
There is more to it than that.
It was intended to be the end of the album, with which we wanted to break the cycle and the rather more difficult issues.
Hvg.hu: how did you choose the six scoundrels?
Why was it, what was the guiding principle?
The idea was to make a Gospel-like chorus.
Then came the idea of putting the chorus of talented soldiers from the local music couses.
The six-pie chorus has been created - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Juder Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then bought in the late Underground Divas.
Hgg.hu: did you have the song in the same way, or did the girls have a hand in shaping it?
The number was in the instrumental version long ago, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this number was' needed something '.
The order of the law has formally demanded a gestures.
I saved the meloden the same night, and later they learned the girls.
It all came almost at first and terrifyingly spontaneous.
I remember being fairly electrified then, but the divas was needed.
With my vote alone, the song would never have been so strong.
Hg.hu: on the record and on the concertation, however, it was felt that girls were in the background.
There is no Solo-part (apart from the short Solo of Judy Jay), they do not have their own role, they sing together completely and are not louder than music, so their song is not only accompanied by music.
They were also on the scene.
Is it intended?
B.Zs@@. that they were standing in the back was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them a role of colossus.
The number also involves forgetting his ego a little, forgetting who came from where and where, we are simply allowing these particular wings, the wings of love, to take us up.
I would like others to feel the euphoria that we felt when the song was born.
Hvg.hu: what was the most expensive song?
For example, there was no such thing as musical creature work, and rather more difficult tasks were involved in Mixing.
For example, in the case of Dorian Gray's dilemma, where I play four in a concert classroom, or in the case of Rock 'n 'Roll Goes to The Girls, where the Groove did not want to work for longer, but gradually everything has been merged, as in the case of a puzzle.
Hvg.hu: what is your favourite number from the new Album?
The second is that this is constantly changing with the concert and also now that I have the album 'relaxed'.
At present, it is' prophet is A Fool ',' Escape from The Earth 'and the number' Never The Same '.
Fraud brokers risked billions because of inferiority.
Soil fraudsters
For example, his former employee, Jerome KerMuch, is called the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Comerční banka.
It was almost EUR 5 billion in its wake.
It seems, however, that Kermass was only a great player who wanted to do the same to his colleagues, and was certainly not incapable of doing so.
To make a difference from all major banking establishments, he recognised the crisis on the US mortgage market in time.
'He is psychologically weak 'was heard from the mouths of his superiors, who denounced him in the police.
However, as Mr Kerviels's report, which was published by the French media, for example the newspaper Le Monde, shows, he was a man who made profits at the end of last year in his business, to the tune of EUR 1.6 billion.
Crisis not only in America
He said, 'Everything I wanted was money for my bank'.
In the summer he managed to earn half a billion euros, particularly in the wake of the American crisis.
He had already missed the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already the first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had previously had problems with paying out, would be in difficulty.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
That was not what we thought and was right.
At the end of the year, he had increased his profits to EUR 1.6 billion.
'Even when I earned the first half billion, I did not know how to explain it ', says Kerlot and goes on to say that he definitely did not hold anything for himself.
Throughout the hearings he admits that he has falsified documents so that he would not be treated as a villain.
He even managed to fool his bosses, even though the Eurexir exchange started to take an interest in his business.
Risk profit
Did he fear flying up?
I hardly think so.
'I thought it satisfied the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank '.
Why did he have the courage to risk so much?
He had to work his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after he had finished his study at the University of Lyon.
Its annual salary was around USD 5000.
After two years, he was already an assistant of a macabre and in 2005 he became a self-employed broker with an annual salary of USD 90.000.
However, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
'I knew at my first conversation in 2005 that I was being watched.
My training and also my professional and personal development 'explains the words of Kerlot to the investigative officers.
But soon after he came in, the first great success was achieved.
He earned a lot with the Alliance's shares by spending half a billion euros on this title's depreciation in the London bomb attacks.
And that was the starting point - now he wanted more.
If you make that profit, let us leave you.
'It is like a snow ', he said to the policeman.
But the leaders were supposed to know everything, or even know it.
'As long as I earned money, you closed your eyes'.
But then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
He wanted to make up for this at a weekend in mid-January.
When he came to work on Monday, he was not a bank employee.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion at that time.
And how did they find him ashamed?
He was suspected of having taken his leave.
'I took only four days from last year.
A broker who does not take a holiday is one who does not want to be seen in his maps', KerMuch said in conclusion.
The Czech Republic has the chance to get EUR 365 billion.
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will enable the Czech Republic to come to EUR 14 billion (approximately 365 billion kronor) over the next few years.
This is about half the amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007-2013.
Some 125 billion kronor come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech firms will be able to get around 100 billion kronor from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The greatest amount of money, some 150 billion, will go to the development of transport.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money is increased in line with the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have EUR 90.8 billion next year.
The 'Enterprise and Innovation' programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to attract funds for innovative undertakings.
This should give companies the financial means to introduce new technologies, to carry out business research, and also to introduce more effective organisational methods.
The Czech Republic has been one of the least successful of the new accession countries to date in the previous Geld-Aquisition of EU funds.
The Nicaraguan court confirms 20 years' imprisonment for ex-presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the 20-year prison sentence imposed on former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to 100 million dollars (almost SEK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hazienda at the Nicaraguan Metropole.
According to the news agency, AP, it is currently unclear whether the former head of state of Central America will be back in power (1997 to 2002).
According to Ileana Pérez, the President of the Court of Appeal, whether he is to be parted at home or be imprisoned will now depend on the officials.
A court ruled four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign firms in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money ended up in a fund that had been set up to finance its election campaign in 2001.
Budget has been implemented
Yes, it has been achieved.
The state budget has been approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has drafted and that was adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The one for this year was approved with the support of the ČSD (Social Democrats), because it was presented by Minister Lópeotka (from that party), and therefore the ČSD could not allow itself to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate prior to the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this law, which was traditionally unrespected but nevertheless extremely important, calmly.
This is somewhat paradoxical.
Governance starts and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more thankful subject for the media and they are therefore paying more attention to it.
A dispute between politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The national budgets of the previous socialist governments have suffered from three weaknesses that the 2008 budget cannot solve at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is legally binding, not only pensions, but also social expenditure, which was decided last year by the 'silent' coalition of ČSD and KSČM (Communists) prior to the elections.
The second is budgetary deficit, which is the result of the first weak point.
The third restriction is the deficits in public finances, in other words, the deficits of the local authorities.
However, the greatest risk is not the public budget deficit.
This budget is public and reasonably under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budgetary deficit of the local authorities.
Many mayors, in order to find other sources of investment, apart from tax, levies and bank credits, often issued bonds in an ill-considered manner, which caused them to incur excessive debt on their town hall.
In recent years they have managed to pay off this debt by selling mass shares from the energy and other supply networks that they had received from the state during the privatisation process.
Now that source has already disappeared.
As far as we are concerned, we are merely following official and verifiable facts, and we note that:
For several years now, like the rest of the world, our economy has been going through a period of growth, of which the ČSD is boasting.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments indebted the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more sensibly than our Republic.
This is a huge disgrace, which is largely due to the previous governments.
We are among those countries that, globally, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why we do not need massive social programmes, which have, unfortunately, been quite unnecessarily inflated to such an extent in recent years.
Even though we have managed to remove some of the senseless populist spending that was adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that, if there is no shift in the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, then practically any policy in this country will end and, no matter who is in power, it will remain nothing but mere administrators.
It is only a slight exaggeration to say that the leaders of politicians will then become officials who mechanically divide the majority of tax revenue into pensions and social expenditure.
This year's budget cannot therefore be a revolution, but can only stop the squeezing of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of SEK 70 billion, which is planned for 2008, would be completely superfluous if previous governments had not spent the last ten years, which was only possible.
If we do not want to see the situation really become a mere administrative officer from the top of the political spectrum, we must be patient and this coalition government, which is not too strong, but which is aware that the State can only spend as much as it can collect in terms of taxes and charges, can wish to be quiet in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these will allow a gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to overcome crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
More than USD 100 billion will be spent on the currency markets by auction.
At these auctions, banks are selling each other up interest rates, and they are prepared to lend each other money.
For example, the American Fed is sending USD 40 billion to auction, and another 24 is doing it more for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of the various states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to avert or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
'This step is intended to eliminate the greatest difficulties facing the economy, in other words the growing lack of free capital available that the banks can lend ', wrote in a report for its clients, Bernard Baumohl, from the Economic Outlook Group.
'The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the US from 65% to around 50% ', added Baumohl in his report.
The banks have already lost USD 60 billion on outstanding loans, particularly in the United States.
Analycians expect further billions to be lost.
'The chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies, said: 'The central banks must have been genuinely afraid of what can still be done when they decided to do this'.
'It looks as though the situation is really bad 'he went on to say.
The central banks fear that, if the banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, they will also find it more expensive to lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, possibly with repercussions on economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided to do so after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank Interchange Interchange rate, which is used in the bank deposit between banks.
This means that the banks have been constantly afraid of lending each other's money, despite the fact that the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain had lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
'This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates', said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Reuters Agency.
Some analysts believe that this step by the central banks will help to fuel the crisis by not resolving the fundamental problem, namely the case of the property market in the United States.
Klaus: debates by ecologists are incredible.
Global climate change is said to be the most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus has again spoken about the issue of global warming.
The criticism was now directed at the UN's international conference on climate change, which is now coming to an end in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book 'A blue planet, not a green planet', he said that the debates of ecologists were unbelievable.
Klaus said that not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric it was using and the reality.
'The debate there is unstructured, it is a piece of words that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems', said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed, when presenting his book, that his subject was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book was shown in German translation because 'I often meet in caricatures of my views'.
Now interested parties could read his position undistorted.
Klaus reminded us that he was not a climatologist, but he believed that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He is, after all, an academic who is able to understand and judge professional deals, has experience with statistics and is also economist.
He said that the main message of the book was that the climate is changing all the time and that its changes are normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not constitute a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
Furthermore, as someone who has experience of totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose other unproven views, and considers this to be a dangerous restriction on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he has repeatedly stated that he is not against 'sensible environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield'.
Klaus had already discussed the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek-Institute.
600,000 people have not been able to change their driving licence.
600,000 drivers missed the deadline for exchanging their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when we can apply for the change so that the authorities can get a new driving licence issued by the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that, after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will be taking to the streets without valid driving rights.
According to the authorities, the main ones not to have exchanged their driving licences were those who no longer want to drive.
While small locations are showing a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of fox notes, the offices of the capital are being flooded with applications, and interest in exchanging currency has increased this week.
The city council executes around 2 000 customers every day.
We have to wait about half an hour.
In Prague, around 140.000 drivers have not yet changed their driving licences.
The issuing of a new driving licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shorter deadline of five days.
In this case, however, the driver has to pay SEK 500.
Drivers who do not make the obligatory exchange by the end of the year and drive without a valid driving licence are threatened with fines from January.
The culprit pays not more than SEK 2 000.
The police can also leave it to a warning when they are being broken.
In the event of an offence, the penalty may rise to SEK 2500.
According to previous information, the local authority can impose a penalty on someone who does not drive at all.
He could be threatened with punishment, it was said, of as much as SEK 30,000.
The ministry has already called on the offices to show leniency and to impose a maximum punishment of SEK 1 000.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, nobody is facing a thousand krona sentence.
The driving licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not a personal identity card that everyone, and indeed a valid one, should have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driving licence.
All we need to do is to take him to the local authority responsible or send him to the local authority by letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalidated.
However, motorists are gradually having to change other types of driving licence.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 have three years to change.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
Hanzelka has said that this involves around 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court reduces penalties for detentions allied with Berdych
Former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, accused of sharing with David Berdych, were given 13 and 10 years in prison.
The decision was taken by the Prague Supreme Court in a final judgment, which reduced its sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detentions of the 'Office for the Fight against Organised Crime' were threatening 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no possibility of appeal against today's judgment, only a review by the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused of this, but he is awaiting the first judgment.
However, in other trials he had already received a total of 16 years' sentences.
He cannot be condemned to more.
In January, a district court found 19 people guilty mainly of involvement in robbery, and the Supreme State Court today negotiated the appointment of 16 of them.
Most of the accused have been contested from the outset on the grounds that this is a well-constructed case.
According to the Medibballistic District Court, police officers, in agreement with, among others, Berdych's criminals, supplied information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gangs to evade prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Koňařík 30% of the spoils for this.
The charge concerns crimes committed by gangs between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, robbery, the victims of which have often suffered serious injuries, but also occupation of authority and illicit possession of weapons.
In fact, during house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, steel munitions, a laser trading clock and a machine gun.
The gang has been charged with enriching itself by many millions of kroner in its robberies.
Apart from almost 20 men in this trial, Berdych and a number of others found guilty of further robbery.
Other men from Berdychs around have to answer for another trial, and other cases have not yet been brought to justice.
The main negotiation so far has escaped Tomáš Pρta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish jail awaiting the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Exchange of children - cocktail: 12 million
For the misrepresentation of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to ask for 12 million kroner compensation plus court costs from the Třebíč hospital.
For each of the mothers, three million each, for fathers, two million and for children one million.
The hospital provides a maximum of 200 000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is therefore totally opposed to the Veleba proposal.
'We reject this proposal, it is many times too high ', said Dostál after today's negotiations.
'However, in order to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the report which the other party has produced.
We will see whether it is worth anything at all.
However, we insist that this should be the area of hundreds of thousands for all together ', stressed Dostál.
He said that the amount was to be between 100 000 and 200 000 kronor for each of the four parents.
At the outset, the family of Jabloňov wanted a million kronor per month, which it had not brought up its biological daughter.
Veleba was the basis for compensation negotiations on the basis of a report prepared for him by the university hospital in Prague Motol.
Children's parents, according to psychology and psychiatric professionals, suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms at varying degrees of strength and depth.
Men have been better at the stress situation, even though they have been accused of preventing the newborn babies from being confused.
Women, on the other hand, are getting worse off the after-effects of the trauma that has been experienced, and Veleba, too, has been concerned with the content of what is going on right now.
Veronika and Nikola were abducted by maternity hospitals in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová after Jabloňov.
The Vysočina County Curtain (Bohemian Mutual) gave each family SEK 100.000 at the end of October as a substitute for expenditure incurred by the fault of the Třebíč hospital, which is under the county.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by the law on the grounds of liability.
If they have any doubts, they must use a reserve fund, but for once they can apply to the developer.
Up to now, the courts have allocated comparatively low compensation sums to those affected, the amounts have been determined by tables and have moved around hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came around its kingdom of whitea
Bolek Polívka lost the argument about the 'Kingdom of Walei' brand.
According to the Ostrava County Court judge, he was the first to use the term 'Walachchen King', but the project had, in many years' work, built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor.
Polívka did not take part in the negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, however, this is probably not the end of the matter and his client is likely to appeal.
'The dispute is about Mr Harabiš and his team wanting to share in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas on an equal footing ', said the lawyer after the Polívka trial.
All of them, when they said 'Walachh Kingdom', thought of this actor and comedian.
Harabiš also shares this view.
'We have been working for almost ten years.
He said 'fundraising and concepts of activity'.
He said that the cause of the dispute is money.
'After years, they have noticed that the project is successful and that they could also benefit from it.
He went on to say that he wanted to make our work more balanced '.
Lucrative business
According to the Court, Polívka was the first time that it was named 'Walachchen King' on one of its television programmes.
In 1993, the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý greeted him.
But that was not the intention at the time to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš was thinking of issuing Forestry Passes.
An initial crackdown on a crazy operation brought a business and business activity into being, to which Harabiš then went on to set up the Walachchen Kingdom.
In 1997 Polívka agreed to use his name and his signature in passports and even offered her owners reductions in visiting his farm and his theatre.
Who will be on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš used only the idea that Polívka had announced in the Manege programme for his entrepreneurial intentions.
'The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Foodland of Wales', the judge said.
It added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project and its team were intensively devoted to it.
Cooperation between the parties that are currently in conflict took place until the year 2000, when Harabiš organised the official culmination for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, Polívka and Harabiš have started to multiply the disputes that culminated in the removal of King Boleslavs I from office until Sankimmer Day.
The leadership then claimed to be Queen Mother at the instigation of Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková.
In 2002, Polívka brought a complaint against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could be brought by the Thron and half a Prince race, which Harabiš is preparing.
A new king should emerge from this.
He did not want to give out details and dates.
'We do not want to rush.
It should be like the Queen's withdrawal in whaling.
The king should be elected for a certain period.
Mr Polívka can also register himself in this', added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: vanishing trees
To tell the truth, I have never been a particular fan of Peugeot 206.
Its fences were not worth much, the quality of the switch, the management and even the processing could be described as rather lower than average.
Now, however, his successor, Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that is much better.
The compass known as the SW is still a long way off and all that remains for me to do is to revise my mind.
When I tested the classic toilet of 207, I had to complain about the lack of copyfreedom in the backbenches, for example.
These complaints are no longer there, because the Combi's carrot is designed in such a way that not even two men will suffer.
Rapid progress
I shall only go through the internal envelope briefly so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a very good design, and I have objections to it because of the meagre middle tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design, for otherwise the car would make such a elegant impression.
The seats are convenient and the time has passed when we may complain about too short seats or headscarves.
The sidelines have also improved considerably in comparison with 206.
As far as the space supply is concerned, here too we can see the increased dimensions of the Karosserie.
The lack of copy-free travel, which has already been mentioned, has also been removed in the Combi.
Suffer in the suitcase
The main thing about this car, however, is the space for the place.
I must describe it, not least because of the stretched window, as being very good and economical.
The areas are filled with halting belts, which are an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, they divide and they also contain more difficult items.
But we are talking about the volume of the cargo.
The table says that the basic content is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared with competition.
However, not in comparison with the Czech Republic, the most sold vehicle of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is lagging behind by a noticeable 52 litres.
This is already critical for foreign holidays or for loading children's cars.
However, to highlight the positive aspects, I must mention the very shallow space after the rear-depositing has been carried out, or even the very low chargers.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was fitted with a four-cycle engine with a cough of 1.6 litres and a service of 88 kWp.
And, to be honest, that should be a 1600-Kubic engine driving a family hate back.
It is quiet, low consumption and well away.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes acts as if his exhaust were capped with a rag, I can only be delighted with him.
The price list speaks volumes.
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
We must remember, however, that we tested a well-equipped car with a comfortable internal and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with its 1400-00-petrol engine of 329900 kronor is still in progress.
With our engine it costs as much as SEK 410900, which is quite a lot.
The equipping of prepositioning of the test car is yet again costing SEK 80.000 in addition to booking.
However, we had copying days, automatic air conditioning, automatic divorce triggering, electric window heaters back and...
In total, the car costs a mere SEK 531900.
That is a lot, but just add the extra equipment for a factory and you will get a very similar amount.
So the only decision remains as to which brand to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not successful.
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, which is causing local anxieties about the further development of the local education system.
The integration of Eastern Europe has so far come up against a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases of violent conflict between immigrants and children of the original inhabitants on the increase.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is a good illustration of the case of North Kent, where the clashes between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
The disputes, harassment and squabbles among pupils have been extended to the relationship between parents.
The situation has already developed to the point where the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year boy with a iron line.
The defendants defended themselves by the boy insulting them with racist insults.
The police had to intervene in a Slovak immigrant even after an attack by two underage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw him with stones.
'When we went home, a boy cared on a bus's head and spilled on us.
When I told him he should stop, he threw us with apples and pears and then he dipped his bags', a mother of Slovak pupils in The Times newspaper wrote another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the local people even described the dispute with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a fight for survival.
The cases cited show that the mood between local people and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In Britain, 70.000 Slovaks have been registered, coming here to seek work.
Approximately 30 000 Slovak pupils are therefore attending British schools.
Cuba - Classification of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will be true if you only choose the right one.
Gulf and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is calm like a pond.
Palmen and all the inclusive with waitresses offering on the beach and pizza, ice and dry cocktails.
Kitesurfing, Gulf and Roulette.
You find that to a greater extent in the Caribbean islands.
But you can find much more on one island, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great West Indies.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for conquering America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever to have a human eye.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was born at the end of the 20th century.
It was a leader of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, who built it, because everything that was considered to be a crime in the United States (especially during prohibition) was readily seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were:
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high houses, over the broad tabloids, were flying over cars that were one of the cultural symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a plant in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his boys.
Stars of Showbusiness and politicians from all over America were left behind by Bodeguita del Medio.
And today?
You too can leave your car programme on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
You are being nipped in cocktails at the Bar in the Nacional Hotel.
The culprits of the 1950s are still travelling around Havana because the Sigulis and Fiats, once imported, fell long ago in the obese and wet air.
Mag Havana, especially the oldest part of the country, has come down a long way, and nowhere in the world are there so many wonderful colonial sensibilities as we have just seen here.
Other places are being exploited, such as Trinidad.
With regard to tourism providing much-needed money, there was the green light for this development.
Over the last fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, along the coast of the province of Holguín and also in islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a brand that is unique in the world and, above all, attracts rail lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought slimmed-spagons powered by vapour and diesel to the sugar factories.
Their car fleet has not been renewed for decades, and that is how you see courageous and fully functioning locomotives whose ancestors have long been in museum elsewhere.
Elimination targets
The most important places are not out of the majority of visitors to Cuba.
We do not need to go into the details of Varadero or Havana.
The only thing that remains to mention is that, in the Hemingway, which has already been mentioned, there is a museum whose visit should not be missed by those who like this writer.
The Viñales-Tal in the west of the island is one of Cuba's most maleral windows.
The abundant vegetation is growing on a cold soil.
Mogotas, calf hens and fields, are rapidly starting to crumble, and fertile soil has been found in their mogotas, covering even crazy fields of land with divine admiration.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of the cigarrene factories in Havana.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean sequence of the television series Major Zeman has been turned there.
Trinidad
An ancient town was founded shortly after the Spaniards colonised the island.
Their glory and wealth were brought by the trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by the later French settlers, has changed little for four hundred years.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road linking the area to the rest of the country even in the 1950s.
This isolation contributed to its failure to take account of it.
Nothing was built there, but nothing was taken away from it, and everyone was glad that they had a roof over their heads.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places around you, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Fabricane.
The evening should be taken to the Casa de la Música, which is revived after the dark, and where music is not silent until tomorrow.
Baracoa
Some people call this urban area the most beautiful of the island.
Certainly, this view is also influenced by the way in which it is conducted.
Both roads leading from Guantánamo to that end have to overcome high and shattered mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern Cuban poster was included in its World Environment List by UNESCO thanks to its untouched nature.
It is there that the best chocolate is produced, it is the church that shows the cross of Columbus (which was in fact about a hundred years after the trip to Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current hotel El Castillo, is located, several table mountains are to be seen, of which El Yunque is the most well-known.
There are many pages to write about coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra-mountains, the pig boot and the Isla de Pinos island, the Tropicana Kabaret, the Holy Holy of the Cuban Patronin Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves are are committed.
But, as they say, look at it better with their own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, according to the Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, is influencing the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Robert Gates, the defence minister, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not in accordance with its own ideas, as was agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland by the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing opposition from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of State Robert Gates, called for more activity from NATO units, Britain sees the priority as strengthening the authority of the Afghan Government and intensifying development aid.
'Afghanistan is experiencing a move forward, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants themselves to start developing the economy and security ', according to the British Minister for Exchange, the BBC Browne.
90%
According to the American army, the Afghan insurgents' activity has reached its highest level for five years.
The number of acts of violence has risen by 27% compared with last year, and even 60% in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have deployed some 40.000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of which are in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit as regards the organisation and equipment of units.
In concrete terms, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
'We will have to think seriously about the concrete targets for the next period and how we can achieve them ', said Gates.
The Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, has said the same thing today.
'I am not pleased with what we have in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about 90% of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is too little, 'said De Hoop of Reuters, the agency, to conclude tripartite talks with the Japanese Government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been a dispute among the countries involved over the last few months as to whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, was criticised for being passive.
'The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
However, they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and where the fighting requirements are not as high for them as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country ', Gates said.
The British tabloid newspaper Sun this week called the German soldiers a lap.
'Afghan non-students disguised: the Germans play games while our boys fight ', the' Sun 'wrote in a speech supplemented by photographs of German soldiers playing a narcotic name.
The German pictures newspaper ran into a counter-attack and printed a picture of British unity in a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Public debt will be up to a trillion in 2009.
In every Czech, a state debt is SEK 84000.
The overall damage rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to take up debt this year with 159.2 billion accounts.
However, at the beginning of December, thanks to the better development of public budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to EUR 152.8 billion.
The sovereign debt of the Czech Republic rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
So within the first nine months of this year they rose by 40.2 billion.
However, since June, they have decreased by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its state debt figures from the beginning of October.
In any Czech case, SEK 84000 is to blame.
Over the past year the state has been in debt for more than SEK 111 billion.
'So far, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we may not exceed the limit of one trillion kronor until 2009.
Next year, the debt was to be between 900 billion and one trillion kroner, 'said David Marek, Patria Finance analysts, Server iHNed.cet@@.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, an analysis of the Next Finance: 'We could exceed a trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it transpired that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be prepared to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I do not expect such a change ', he said.
Debt growth
The state debt stems from the government's debt and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt is financed by treasury bonds, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic public debt has now risen to SEK 719.4 billion this year.
The foreign debt of the state has now risen by SEK 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 83.3 billion kroner at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of sovereign debt rose to 6.5 years.
'The overall credit rose by 13% over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is a really great deal, given how well the economy is going.
It is interesting that the increase is particularly in the area of bonds, where the growth is 20%.
It is bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that something can be done even before pension reform is introduced ', reported Pikora the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the way in which the public debt is handled for 2007 show that the government had planned to absorb SEK 159.2 billion this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry, thanks to the better development of public budgetary policy, reduced the plan to SEK 152.8 billion.
This amount is mainly due to the public budget deficit, which this year will apparently reach SEK 76 billion instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum of appropriations earmarked for the Consolidation Agency, which is costing SEK 13.3 billion, a 10-billion reserve to pay pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion and the payment of 1.8 billion for loans to the European Investment Bank.
She was brought before a court in Khartoum today for giving a name to a teddy.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who was accused of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days' imprisonment and subsequent expulsion.
The bride has been accused of allowing six-seven-year pupils to give the name of Mahomet to a tendybor, even though any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
It deserves to have been flogged.
After parents of schoolchildren complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Education on several occasions, the 54-year-old primary school teacher who was working on the Unity High School of Khartoum was taken to his home on Sunday and, pursuant to Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, accused of insulting Islam.
In fact, this matter started in September, when the teacher called on her six-seven-year pupils to choose a name for the class teddy.
Children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, and Robert Boules, head of school, report.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favourite name.
Mohammed is certainly the name of the Islamic prophet, but it is also, and above all, a very frequent preface in Sudan.
Then children produced a class book, with the bear photograph and the pictorial copy followed by Mohammed.
The bear himself did not wear a sign bearing that name, but the problem is quite simply that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered to be an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons's Muslim colleagues, who is teaching at the same school in Sudan, has said that he knows them well and that she would never have done anything to make them believe in a religious faith, but I regret that she has asked the children to vote for a name, which in his opinion is just a joke of innocence.
This is an opinion shared by many of the pupils of the teacher, who considers them to be extremely attentive to their pupils and as a person who never speaks of religion in class.
It should be noted that the first name Mohammed is also the second most commonly used in Britain, for which 14 different desks exist in English.
This pre-name, often selected by Muslim families, is considered to be a kind of honorary to the prophets (it is often given to the first mother of a family).
But what are the rules on the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
Final of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo ended a sixth and last session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their disputes over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach agreement on the status of the party, as the European mediator, Wolfgang Ischinger, stated at a press conference in Vienna.
While emphasising that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner called on Belgrade and Pristina to honour their obligations to maintain peace and continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
There is no expectation of violence in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, and he indicated that there are clearly significant tensions.
Closure of the mediation on 10 December
The troika intermediaries, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province, which is 90% Albanian speakers, could be clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The Baden talks, near Vienna, have been the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika last August, which has been mandated by the UN to re-engage in mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, are insisting on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
Russia was and remains the advocate of a negotiated solution, of a consensual solution, said Botsane-Khartko.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of being under UN administration, the West considers independence, under EU supervision, to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in favour of it.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, as the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced in the Bavaria hotel, where since Monday these negotiations have been held at the last chance.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, shared his regrets.
He added, however, that the plan for autonomy proposed by Belgrade was a past that led to murders and deportations.
ρDomino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, believed that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority of Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence for the province.
Belgrade thinks it is particularly 'domino effect' in a region that is so weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken solely and exclusively in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto.
The parliament of Kosovo will have the last word.
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, as the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has said.
These negotiations have taken two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
The journalist Fatmir Sejdiu replied that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word on the status of Kosovo and added that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian speaking population would be conducted in consultation with the Western countries.
Bush is disenchanted by an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which was held on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, under his leadership, President Bush said that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He went on to say that the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, and the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, had agreed to start negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive solution to the 60 year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything possible to help them reach a peace agreement before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must continue to destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonisation work, as Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitment to the Roadmap 'Peace', which they agreed to in 2003.
The White House's leader stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas ultimately seek a peace agreement that will resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the central issues.
This name includes the three serious problems that the Israeli-Palestinian quarrels mainly revolve around: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who, in the wake of the 1948 conflict, were expelled from their homeland, which is now the State of Israel.
Following the American President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations should be conducted in a comprehensive and thorough manner and that they should be regulated on all points, including Jerusalem, which listed refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, for his part, took the floor, he committed himself to ensuring that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to bring them to an end before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, which are in harmony, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it received an assurance from Bush in this regard before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan accepted by all Arab countries, offering peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially since it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects, the Saudi Arabian Prince says in his interview with the Arab-language daily newspaper funded by Saudi money.
The prosecutors do not believe that the police are responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumours are on the brink.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the National Police Service (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 o 'clock, a police vehicle on the Rue Louise Michel went to Villiers-le-Bel.
He did not use it, but he was on strike and he was driving 40-50 km / h without blue lights, a police spokesman says.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, fitted without authorisation, in other words, not released for public road transport (see down), was driven by two young people without a helm, and proceeded at a very high speed.
He then went on to tell the left side of the police force, after ignoring the lead of the right, and a policeman went on.
The alcohol control carried out by passengers on vehicles is very negative.
The condition of the car (versed cock poultry, fragmented windscreen, run-off peak) is testament to the strength of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the State Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigative body on the 'facts of involuntary murder and lack of assistance to persons in danger', in agreement with the main management of the public security of Val-d 'Oise.
On the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she ruled out the IGPN being investigated at this stage of the proceedings.
According to the Magistratin, three witnesses to the accident that was heard on Sunday evening confirmed the version of the police, namely that this petty trail was relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, a sort of rental, certainly due to the irritation of the footballs on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained interconnected until the police managed to slow down.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be the subject of a technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were beaten yesterday.
What happened afterwards?
Yesterday, a rumour was circulating in Villiers-le-Bel that the police had left the scene very quickly, without providing help to the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious error concerning this matter.
According to one source of police cooperation, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires further investigation, and one that must be handled very carefully.
Libération has hit a witness of these few moments just after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct look at the scene.
We immediately went out with my own kusine, who was hospitalised nurses, to try to reinvigorate it, he tells us.
There was nothing to be done.
Then he saw a completely disrupted policeman who was lying behind.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth on the telephone.
In view of the tension which had quickly arisen around what happened and which it seems was due to the certainty of the people present about the unhoped-for situation of young people, the police were taken in by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Even according to this testimony, the rescue workers arrived around twenty minutes after the policemen left.
They have also used heart mills, but in vain.
I will not allow people to claim that the police have not helped the young.
They have been given the first aid.
The fire brigade arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, and the prosecutor herself stressed this.
Tension is rising in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police attacked the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
Evidence has shown that in the town of Lahore in the east of the country, around 2 000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken against the emergency zones were injured by tear-gas grenades appointed by the police forces.
Those people then threw stones with which they wounded the police.
At least 350 lawyers have been temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios have occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked lawyers and injured them.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court's legal profession have called for a general strike and have announced demonstrations following a wave of around 500 arrests of opposition figures, human rights defenders and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked in order to prevent the Assembly.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (mid-@@) and Peshawar (north-east).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement received the support of religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose President called on the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the emergency and to those who laid an oath before Musharraf.
There is no longer any room for Musharraf's promises.
Pakistan's Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
He had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct ballot on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been dismissed and replaced.
The Magistrate of The News newspaper declared that it was damaging everything that we represent illegally, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court.
Pervez Musharraf's promises to hand over the army's command and to appoint a civilian president are no longer being worn since the emergency was declared on Monday by the Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would give his military uniform by 15 November, the date on which his first term of office as President would end.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the elections could be postponed from January.
Furthermore, the Pakistani Government denied the country's persistent rumours that President Musharraf would have been given a place of residence by his deputy chief chief.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unplanned
This calculation takes account of unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the New Year Act, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes account of unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Committee estimates that the various contraceptives, such as the pill or the spiral, still have a benefit rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pumping users between 20 and 40 years of use of the pill has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless made it possible to improve control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned today.
One in five couples is even calculated accurately in the month and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems that it is most attractive to have a child.
Stage spectacular repairs
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the International Space Agency (ISS) crew will have taken more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repairs of a failed solar panel, which is essential for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A risky withdrawal which, due to its duration, the distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was organised and the tools fitted by astronauts, which are fitted to repair, has achieved several records.
The problem arose on Wednesday when astronauts had discharged the modul Harmony from the Discovery Pass, a large part of the cynical element that is soon to be taken up by European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of bridge for the Module laboratories.
But they must be able to be supplied with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17.5 tonnes of heavy modules for electricity production from solar panels, which was already on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After it had made it possible, the crew went on to restructure the Moduls solar panels, which range from 76 metres.
And it has happened that one of the collectors that can be seen as ackordeone has been damaged by a restricted cable for approximately one metre length.
The restructuring process was stopped so as not to further damage the college.
The astronauts who originally went out of the Discovery space ferry for a check and were then to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was flawed were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around the 30 metre distance controlled arms of the spatial ferry at the station to carry out repairs.
He is one of the best spaceforesters (weather-jage-guzzlers) of NASA.
Big, resistant, very clever, he has a well-developed head and a long arm.
The 46-year old doctor has therefore been selected to run the battered sun panel.
After examining the damage closely, he took the wrong cable and forged a kind of avenue at the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who was close to the sludge and, within and by the other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey scoundler, with solitary confinement, to prevent an electric blow from the solar panels that produce several hundred people, had been thought up and moved on the astronauts on board the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the College was fully developed before he was cancelling his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day's relaxation before seven astronauts returned today to Discovery, in order to probably catch the ground on Wednesday.
EADS on the stock exchange
After the aviation and defence group announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to counteract the A400M residues, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decline in the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently, EADS 4% is losing EUR 21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007, in relation to the delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delay the plane's young flight.
The cost announced in October to offset the delay in supplying its military transport aircraft amounts to between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion, of which more than a billion is taken for Airbus, announced by the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Because of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, without further details.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six months' delay.
As a reminder, EADS's business performance fell from 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs involved in delaying another programme, the very large carrier A380.
Originally, the group had planned an initial delivery of A400M to the French army for October 2009.
Election of status quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting when the ballot boxes are counted: the majority of Russians will choose President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very threadbare election campaign, it confirms its desire for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending out a message to the voters on the public channels, which has already been recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the leading candidate of the United Nations, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is being announced.
Yesterday, the President did not let anything go by when he received foreign ambassadors and was content with providing a new starting point against the Western powers, which are accused of interference - his favourite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and we hope to have honest elections, very transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the opposition's point of view, they have lost their way.
They are denouncing an election campaign, which is stained by repression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there have never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
Following the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, ex-Chachéchworldmaster Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days' imprisonment for illegal demonstrators, according to his lawyer, a ban on visits continues.
The Russians have maintained the Homo Sovieticus mentality.
After these parliamentary elections, there are two far further-reaching questions:
Who will follow Putin's lead?
Yesterday, the newspaper announced the date of the first round of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make their mark.
As he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third mandate in a row.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Will the President of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party of the United Russia, the government and President be selected?
Whatever the situation, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the power that has been vested in the past will triumph.
That is tradition.
The Russians have maintained the Homo Sovieticus mentality, they are not Mr James's Goudkov, the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of Saint Petersburg is even further behind: civil society has only progressed very slowly in this country, which has been Christian for five centuries in Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has realigned himself with the paternalistic model of a state, which was fully accepted by the people, all the more so because this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman of the Carnegian Foundation.
Today, the Russians are freely avoiding the personal responsibility which they have short-lived since the break-up of the USSR.
Is there much to be done about it?
This phenomenon affects all levels of society, including business.
And the administrative elite is able to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional chairs) are running the United Nations' local electoral lists.
New freedoms from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public favours stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Tamara Tcherednitchenko's conclusion, a 54-year-old professor: does he think too long?
Those in power are not so bad as to replace them?
A difficult thought
Having been treated in confidence for more than 60 years, the Bad Arolsen Nazi archives, which reveal the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million archives' documents, which are in Bad Arolsen for a total length of 27 km, have not yet been seen, unless with a starving humanitarian purpose, that is to say, individually and in terms of names, that is, after a former victim or his family has been consulted.
The 11 states responsible for administering them - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been in place since yesterday.
Healthy information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to investigate, specifically the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the state of health of forced labour, explains Reto Meisters, head of these archives administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these namese-related documents accessible to the public, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental obstruction of some of the victims of deportation.
The detention lists of concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo were gathered for a practical reason after the war: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and perhaps to provide them with evidence of their arrest, thus paving the way for their compensation.
Even today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are still working on tens of thousands of personal enquiries.
However, some of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
It was Pr who said that Wolfgang Benz, head of the Centre for Research into Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, was in 2006.
The EU and India want to have a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Trade Minister, Peter Mandelson, and his inverse counterpart, Kamal Nath, said that the European Union and India hoped to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean), and mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission's figures, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will take the two economies a great deal further and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed by Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most products exported by India, the European Commissioner went on to say that the Asian and European giants exchange goods worth EUR 47 billion annually and offer services worth EUR 10 billion, this week, had said Daniéle Smadja, Chairman of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, and regretted that mutual trade had not yet reached its potential, and that the EU and India met on Friday in New Delhi, where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durao Barrosso, will be present.
(Report of AFP)
The Bank of England takes note of the concern and provides GBP 10 billion for five weeks.
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed its concern about the current recurrent concern about credit conditions and announced an offer of GBP 10 billion, with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an extraordinary ten-year offer.
In order to mitigate the fears that financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year and to give greater certainty to banks about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions during this period, the bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its savings during the conservation phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, it makes provision for it in a communication.
The bank continues to state that, on 6 December, at 12.15 GMT, 10 billion pounds (EUR 14 billion) will be brought into circulation, on the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE has been circulating liquidity operations for five weeks in an open market operation.
This is normally done for one week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it is willing to take further measures to maintain the intergovernmentalism of intermittent charges with their basic interest rates, which vary from day to day.
The inter-state interest rate, which varies from day to day, was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate has increased to 6.6%, a little higher since 18 September.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been linked to penalties that have prevented the banks from using them.
According to some rumours, reinforced by the development of the deposit rate as opposed to the euro, many people preferred to sign up to the sums that were circulated by the European Central Bank, at more favourable interest rates and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review the PS proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is tantamount to rejecting the text.
The text, which was produced as part of a socialist gathering (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group), gave rise to approximately ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, the majority of which were flown on the employment supplement, the reintroduction of the TIPP, a transport check or the delimitation of tenders.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the sitting was closed after the main discussion, which gave rise to sometimes violent exchanges between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS member, Jean Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would present all of its proposals as an amendment to the draft bill for the correction of finances, which was examined last week by the problem of asbestos.
A new festival will be born
Following numerous rumours about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the Promoter / Producer is announcing the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in cooperation with the festival of the British producer, Melvin Benn.
It is an honour for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a model for the current American festival movement, Charlie Jones has been brought in from C3 to Bilboard.com.
C3 is hosting the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping leave.
The festival is likely to take place on 8-10 August, on a 500 Acre in a large private farm, around 40 minutes away from Philadelphia.
The head of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989 he took over the reading festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80 000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and then, in 2006, the Latitude Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, has also been concerned about production, licensing concessions and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which has now been able to take up up to 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones von C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever been in, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn are working side by side in order to offer the area a European-style festival.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and we are working with the Fair Trade Park Commission to create a festival in the centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We had negotiations looming in the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have stayed stuck in political debates on the current administration, and Charlie Jones continues.
'Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population '.
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 in the Grand Park Chicago after it showed itself in 2002 together with the late City Limits Music Festival in the World Festival.
The two events in 2007 have managed to achieve USD 9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax revenue.
These two festivals are held in an urban environment.
'The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas our own is more likely to be in green urban areas' says Charlie Jones.
'The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, in order to give the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban way in the American way '.
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
'The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is happy to take on the burden of this event 'says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but it acknowledges that 'they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to take on a festival that will hopefully have a long life'.
Charlie Jones says that the festival's absorption capacity is' very great ', in line with about 80 000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but nothing has been confirmed when they were printed.
'Vineland will offer a deafening rock, but music will be very diverse, in the hope of attracting all kinds of viewers' says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Prize of the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is the terminator.
It is not easy to get the main platform for hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the terminator does not oppose it.
These attempts at relaxation are delegated tasks.
A politically 'delicate mandate' because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the 'Runaway Productions'.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the 'Gouvernator'?
'We must be careful, because it is industry that decides where it goes.
If she thinks that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are considered to be best 'he says.
The call for festivals.
However, for Denis Turcotte the top priority at the moment is to move the cinema there forward.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
All the festivals on the west coast, although Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about presenting the films from Quebec, assessing them and ensuring that the producers give interviews.
The dark era had a successful idea on 30 Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented in January at the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake account with the Devil is on the placard in Santa Monica and will be presented on 30 Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films on the American film institute Fest.
Is the stock exchange about to be a finite year rally?
With just under five weeks to the annual accounts on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands with the prospect of the next finality year rally.
However, experts cannot make any firm forecasts in this respect.
It is a commonly held belief that, in purely statistical terms, December's exchange rate will normally be accompanied by positive market developments.
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make short-term forecasts based only on statistics, especially when serious tensions determine current market events.
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong rate increase in recent weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the price of stock exchange rates is determined by the liquidity of the market and market players, who, due to the lack of secure equity funds, invest mainly in pension funds, which are severely affected by the trend towards accumulating wealth.
These experts therefore believe that the stock market will be more of a collateral trend, influenced by market fluctuations, especially as we are not yet in a position to estimate the extent of the possible fall in the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve, a uncertainty caused mainly by the increased price of crude oil and the risk of the rate of inflation rising.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the BPI sales department in Spain, agrees that it is a risky time to announce an imminent market rally.
The expert assures us that opportunities are not very well grasped.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has lost 4% since its peak mark on 8 November of 15 945.7 points.
Not all the experts share the same negative view.
According to Juan Solana, analyst of Intermoney, Ibex 35, due to the restructuring of investment funds and the traditional pension fund subsidies which are paid at this time each year, could be successfully concluded with almost 16 000 points.
However, the expert points out that things could change slightly this year, particularly because of the final session that is already taking place in the second week of December, and therefore immediately after the bridge day on the Constitution day.
According to the analysts, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at the Bank Inversis, has estimated that the market assessments to date are at almost technical levels, which could lead to a deviation from the index values being noticeable in the near future, the scale of which is far removed from the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst is confident that these are positive.
Analysis is unanimous in the selection of values to promote the Ibex with new maximum levels.
Solana, in his own name, tells us that this year is the turn of great values.
Among the winners of the prize would be the expert on the two major banks and some property companies, since the electricity sector will be too expensive at the appropriate time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha from the Bank Inversis assures us that the increases will be accompanied by the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the property companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on a catching-up course in recent months and we hope that other property companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, so he is doing.
As regards the increased consumption of Christmas days, during the last half of the year, the market will be dominated by regular consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that even if the technology is represented on the Spanish market in a small number, it will also yield positive results.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has had only two falling courses.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, it led the stock exchange out of its crisis and, at the same time, launched the last real annual rallye so far.
This year, when Ibex grew 35 by 28.17 points, December had a 6.68% rate increase.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and will also show a final round of the year, will be apparent.
Popular will have opened its 200 lending institutions from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically viable regions of Spain.
These branches are a major milestone for the institute, which operates under the name of Popular Max.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes, since Popular is the first banking group to take the risk of extending the opening times of its branches until 20: 30 per day and to increase from 10h to 20.30h on Saturday.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeated the renewal of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The Bank's current negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aiming at an agreement that will close 75% of all branches in the middle of the week and open them up to them on a weekly day, albeit not for the customer.
Whether other banks will join the new initiative, which will adapt to the opening hours, will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention of the Popular project.
The aim is to extend the opening times of those branches which, because of their situation, can cover the purchasing clienteles of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large purchasing houses.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, because these are not new opening times, but changes.
To this end, the Bank will reorganise the premises of those branches that are already in commercial zones and, at the same time, bring them into line with the individual customer profile of the various zones.
Thus, the extension of opening hours is linked to a new design of branches, which is more up-to-date and more colourful.
The relevant banking representative, Ángel Rivera, is assuring us that restructuring does not require greater investment, but would involve an increase in recruitment, since a branch would no longer need six but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even have extra rooms for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried its approach on nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as Ángel Rivero said.
The sites in the streets of Bravo Murillo, O 'Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for this, which seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular is currently running around 2 500 branches.
And another 60, which are called Mundocredit, are specialised in immigrants and also have extended opening times, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of popularMax, the BBVA model is not being used, since most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete with our customers, says Rivero.
They have provisionally agreed with Telefonica to sell mobile phones using external bank personnel.
The Spanish private channel Telecinco is doubling its stock market value for the first time, and is thus overtaking its third rival Antena.
We have managed to do it.
With this sentence, the Telecinco Managing Director, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the stock exchange, which had increased its value by two times his rival Antena 3.
However, one aspect dashed his joy: that is precisely what I am hurt by; he said that we were not in a situation of higher growth, but that we had reduced losses.
He stressed that they did not sink too low despite the weak market.
Telecinco ended yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66% this year.
According to the information provided by Bloomberg, the company's value now reaches EUR 4.48.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the majority of capital (52%) and Vocento being involved only with 13%.
Antena 3 rival lost 1.52% yesterday and has registered a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value stands at half, with 2.193.46 million.
The market value of other listed communication companies is, however, rising to 3 571 million in the case of Sogecable, 2 518.53 million in Prisa (editor of the magazine Cinco Días) and 1 779 million in the case of Vocento.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that it involves two similar companies, such as Vasile.
The question remains as to how far we can actually act on stock exchange technology, at what price and how we can make it profitable at customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago that he would be the first television station this year with over 1 000 million gross profits from advertising revenue, a guiseppe Tringali, the Telecinco and Publiespaña director, the group's advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the channel would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared with the 965.4 million from last year.
In the case of Antena 3, the net rate rose by 1.6% in the first nine stock exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while net revenue from the television business only increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor in the Telecinco stock exchange, compared with the better, is seen by analysts in the high payment ratio that the company has had up to now: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría set up a 100% dividends.
Vasile, however, assures us that the ratio could still vary after the 33% purchase of Endemol's shares, with Mediaset as a parent company, even if it is too early to make an official announcement.
We are obliged to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always given much more.
I hope that this year we can satisfy our shareholders, whose share values we have already increased by purchasing 33% of the end pool.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing certain signs of loss.
Letter Brothers recently reduced his speculation on Telecinco by 4% this year and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1%.
This has also reduced the anticipated revenue calculation of Antena 3% for 2008 by 4.5% and 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high efficiency yield and its sustainable potential, and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: measured Telecinco (buy) as a result of the many incentives applied and maintained a more favourable position for the prosperous market than Antena 3.

JPMorgan: in view of similar threats (a cut-off market and a poorer economic climate), recommends that expectations in both cases be lowered.
Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which came into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary process which has ended today with the Congressional Decision in the Senate on the supplementary amendments attached to the project, the government published the provisions arising from the new law with the aim of allowing both regulations to enter into force by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously applauded the efforts of congressmen and senate members, who, in their negotiations and votes, sought to establish the best possible regulation, which would guarantee the safety of investors and regulate the various activities of employers, in order to guarantee a generally efficient market.
The MIFID, which redefines the investment services system, is pursuing, in addition to modernising the financial markets, an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the control requirement of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new directive will make it possible to offer financial advice to both specialised firms and to natural or legal persons and will also contribute to the creation of new financial services (ESIS), consultants, which will join forces with investment and intermediaries in securities.
It also extends the number of systems for executing financial transactions so that the regulated circulation markets are supplemented by multilateral systems of transactions and systems for internationalising trade contracts, which would eventually compete with current economic operators.
The law requires investment firms to make known the priorities of their business profiling, the confrontation and ways of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV's supervisory role.
The Congress Economic Commission made further subsequent changes, with the decision that the titling of the debt must now be considered complex financial resources, given the high risk level for the investor, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis.
Furthermore, the entry into force of the directive on the legal limitation of the work of qualified economists was used; 30 years after 1977, the regulation was adopted restricting the areas reserved for economists.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the economic mediator who works on foreign accounts, does not need authorisation from CNMV and can offer his services for the commercialisation of products and for after-sales, at the same time, several investment firms.
The harmonised consumer price index (VPI) increased by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess inflation within the European Union provides the average price development that took place in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which, by publishing the data, are seeking to compare the sites and the quality of US products.
The forecast of the indicator can be made early by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, while at the same time using various other statistical modulation methods to assess the lack of information at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the prematurely identified indicator would only serve as a guideline and therefore would not have to be consistent with the final result that will be announced on 14 December next.
The consumer price index (VPI) will continue to be relatively high.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Economic and Financial Minister, Pedro Solbes, the increase in the VPI in November was a marked temporary development, while at the same time he promised that the price index would continue to be at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Commissioner Solbes stated in the halls of the Congress building that, even if the current figure is not good, Spain's difference in inflation with the other members of the monetary union in recent years has remained more or less unchanged.
He also said that in November there were fewer surprises than last month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
When we expected a figure of around 4%, the Economic and Finance Minister announced that it would be in line with the forecast published today.
Virgin accounts for over EUR 42 billion in the next three years with Northern Rock
Northern Rock's assets have fallen by more than half since the bank, in mid-September last year, asked the UK Federal Reserve for an emergency loan, and now they have dropped to just GBP 12 000 (that is EUR 16.800 million).
At that time, the bank's assets were a record of £25.000 million, a sum which has fallen considerably in two and a half months due to the loss of confidence of customers and which, despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money would be safe, will continue to fall by the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would continue the group after it was taken over under the name of Virgin Money, will have to make up about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be based on the facilities of the next three years, to acquire the GBP 18 billion that is still needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The Multimillionaire Richard Branson group, known by its notable publicity campaigns in the UK, intends to channel GBP 50 000 million (approximately EUR 70 million) annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its objective.
This week Northern Rock called the Virgin Corporation, which has three more companies involved, its preferred tenderer to lead it out of bankruptcy.
The Mayor of Totana has been arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in municipal corruption.
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) town of Murcia, because of the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the local council and the head of the local police have been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo took over from Juan Morales last May, now a Member of the Partido Popular and then Chairman of the Totana City Council, and according to information from the Cadena SER radio station, he could be the original organiser of the plot.
Officials continue to search for the administrative documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales's lawyer has been accused of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information from Cadena SER, the lawyer of the printing man was appointed and, as a result, privileged MEP Juan Morales was arrested when leaving his client for important and sensitive documents relating to the plot.
Other sources of information are also being provided from the alleged housekeeping payments to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of a urban contract in which the construction of a 200 hectares of land was decided.
At present, eight people are being held in custody.
Bono agreed to accept the candidature of the PSOE in Toledo and, if elected, in Congress.
Former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer made by the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who will then lead the list of PSOE candidates in the forthcoming general elections in Toledo and, if the Socialists win the elections, will take over the position of Congressional President.
José Blanco, the Minister for the Coordination of the PSOE, and Bono announced this at the press conference, following a meeting with Zapatero in the party's headquarters today.
The Prime Minister believes that the offer to the former Minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Furthermore, if the Socialists won the forthcoming elections, the Mancha politician would appear to be standing as President of Congress for the Party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as President of Congress, who announced on 15 November that he would no longer be attending the next general election, that he would cease his career in public politics and that he would instead be fighting for climate protection in the university area.
The former minister had to admit that the President of the Government had been continually pressing for his return to political life since his resignation two years ago.
He also pointed out that, as in the case of the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to deprive the citizens of who would take over the position of President of Congress if the election were to be successful, and he said that this was a flaw of transparency.
If he takes over, he hopes to transform the Chamber into a despotic house of respect, not of insult or fuss, in order to make it increasingly more similar to the citizens who are worn.
Unfortunately, from time to time, one gets the impression that the only place where we cannot speak calmly and calmly in Madrid is the Congress, with the President of the Senate being cut off by up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President, Manuel Martín, and commended his good work, suggesting that he did not want to appear to have taken over, otherwise his political opponents would describe this as conjuring arrogance.
Climate propaganda
As the climate debate is subject to ruthless criticism both of the sceptics of climate change and of those who are highlighting social and political debate on this, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero of the Government, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal brings it in a need for clarification on the action or otherwise of its government, which has played a decisive role in ensuring that Spain is at the top of the EU's list of countries that have least complied with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for failing to meet the targets, which sectors are responsible for this, and why did his government, which proposed the Treaty with the planet, not stop this development.
It is also now obliged to explain to the Spanish citizens without any hesitation what measures it intends to take to combat climate change.
What companies will be affected by this, what will be the behaviour of the citizens, what individual and collective austerity measures will have to be implemented and what will be the economic consequences of this?
To be more specific, who will have to sacrifice and pay to save the planet.
However, there have been no such declarations and there will be no such statements in the future.
Precisely because it is a matter of sacrifice and payment.
The measures that can be taken to combat climate change in real terms are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening for the accounts of firms and citizens.
Even the benzine cent proposed by PSOE appeared so dangerous in terms of the elections that it was forced to withdraw the proposal again.
Accordingly, we must now save the planet with nothing, in other words with pure propaganda and empty slogans, without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, Commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
With its agreements with the planet, the politicians who are otherwise so suitable for election campaigns must neither talk nor denounce, but instead do the demanding expense of tidying up the meetings and, with his sanctity and goodness, inspiring others.
However, this can only happen if the Treaty does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future, or that we can only refresh ourselves with a single subject.
The Mayor and Chief of Police of Totana, due to an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, which is part of Murcia, the popular attorney of José Martínez Andreo, and the local chief of police, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel firm, who were detained on suspicion of urban infringements, as was said today in the investigative circles.
The town council was arrested in its place of residence, from where it was taken to the municipal authority and in the premises it is in until now, surrounded by a large number of agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal management management of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are linked to the visits already made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which showed that more than 2 million hectares of unfinished land for urban projects under the leadership of the Galician construction company, Nuaria, should be transformed into a property of 4000 homes after the illegal revisions that the local administration carried out during the last parliamentary term.
In addition, two other people were not directly arrested, but were subject to an investigation, which was initiated and carried out by the first Totonas court.
The first six detainees have been brought before the judge today.
According to investigation teams, the former Mayor of Totana and the current independent JPA member Juan Morales are also being investigated.
His enquiry, the holder of a property company registered in Totana, and his current friend, who is in Murcia, are also under suspicion.
The leader and owner of the group Nuaria, the Vigrán lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A@@., was arrested in the town of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was the Managing Director of the company of SvenSuelo de Inmonuar тPablo José M.G@@., whose company is alleged to have been treated as a subgroup of unsafe nuclear shells and has been given bribes.
The investigation is being carried out by the local authority against urban offences, under the supervision of the Guardia Civil central unit, whose representatives have carried out 11 further searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farming industry, who was supposed to have acted as a mediator.
The Nuaria building group was instructed to build the largest residential complex of the town of Murcia, which should have more than 5 000 homes, a golf and two Spam hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres in Totana, which had to be rebuilt, with the aim of implementing a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25 000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of property; Conyase, which is operating in Vigo on the parking sites of the Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activities are limited to the direct marketing sector and Preizconiza, specialising in the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.
Things that may happen
1.
If you agree, we will move away from the expression based on the written book of the month and instead try to invent a price name for another name with appropriate competence.
I have a proposal already.
People, life means change.
You are, of course, most welcome to put forward your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment made yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, the Helsinki St Somat (Finland is, incidentally, at the head of the PISA study), which takes a position on the comment published in the same newspaper on 18 November; incidentally, on that day, the edition of which contained the criticism of the Book Blackburn.
Following the tragedy at Jokela School, the content of the subject of the simple philosophy has become a subject of public debate.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a Abiturient who, in his news, quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The chairman of the Committee on Education for the Fach Philosophy, Pekka Elo, in an interview of the Elgin Sanomat newspaper, called on the teachers to adopt a more critical stance towards Platon and proposed that the Platon's apprenticeship should be deleted from the Study Study for the Fach Philoxenia of Gymnasia.

One Member informs of the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the penal code:
Oh a lift downloading would be a breach of the law, which would be considered to be six months' imprisonment.
But if you go back to the business of music below EUR 400, it is only a simple infringement (Article 623 (1)).
For example, if you shut the shop up to a value of EUR 1 000, the theft is indeed a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than for a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
Indeed, if you change a car and recapitulate it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than that for a download (Article 244.1).
It is not so serious to participate in a script as to take part in a music exchange.
To engage in a rebellious dispute entails a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 Criminal Code), while data exchange results in a deprivation of liberty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 Criminal Code)
In fact, Article 184.2 of the Penal Code states that sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
. Failure to trade in copyright films, which has not been authorised by the creators, will be subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague is right, someone has made a fine job of overstating his demands.

My own home doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: 'If money is used, it leads to the activation of certain brains, especially if the others get more of it'.
So the feelings raised by the monthly salary are dependent on colleagues' salaries.
The study was carried out by means of a tomographical reference analysis at Bonn University, and the results were published in the latest edition of the scientific journal Science.
Bernd Webers, the author of the study and director of the Bonn HirnResearch Centre, Life & Brain, said that the activation was strongest when the participant gave the right answers and his actor failed.
Researchers have been able to see that brain activity has always been very moderate when both participants were right in their response and received the same salary, but when one of them was given double, there was also a greater brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it will take so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Balkan public prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly trampling for eight years on the criminals of the Balkan wars, and is in the public prosecutor's office of the former Yugoslavia court, based in La Haya.
Their mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave office with a wearisome and laughable eye, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims died - are still at large, namely ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic.
Their names are on the list, which is made up of the Swiss director Marcel Schüssel, who is on the list of his documentaries' La List de Carla (2006, not yet in Spain); a film which, at the rate of a Politburo, is following the Swiss public prosecutor from Belgrade to New York for her project to track down the escaped criminals and to put pressure on the respective governments to close their networks.
What kind of insurance is best for me?
CHP insurance, which covers a possible accident caused by drivers, involves a high cost, the level of which relies on various factors, including age, sex, the time when the driving licence is to be issued, the family status of the car to be covered and the use thereof, and so on.
Having a car is only the beginning.
It is even more difficult to find the appropriate car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, one must be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance policyholder.
This agreement is set out in writing by means of an insurance contract which stipulates that the company will receive the insurance premium it has agreed and that it will be obliged to submit the corresponding amount of compensation in the event of a claim.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance which is made up of several factors, including age, sex, the time when the driving licence is being produced, the level of the family, the type of vehicle to be covered or the use of it.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so higher contributions are also required if the risk of accidents increases.
For this reason, both over 25 and women will have to pay less, because statistics show that, thanks to their caution, these groups have a lower accident rate.
The same applies to married people, who, according to the statistics and therefore also the conviction of companies, tend to be less affected than single people.
The benefits attached to the vehicle affect the frequency of the vehicle and, therefore, the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage is.
In the process of drawing up the premium, insurance companies must take a whole range of points into account.
For this reason, drivers too must study the situation thoroughly in order to choose precisely the car safety that best meets their personal needs.
We are now listing the most important points that should be taken into account when choosing insurance, so that we can make not only a choice based on performance but also a price.
Those under 25 years of age encounter many obstacles in choosing low-cost insurance, such as low driving practice and the fitted young driving licence.
Even if it is best for an ideal insurance scheme to take full debt insurance, there are cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full cascade with their own participation, so that the benefits of full insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract means that the customer will have to pay part of the amount of the damage.
The amount is fixed before the contract is concluded and according to the level of the insurance premium, which is higher than the amount paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain's main representative at First Europe, a company that provides online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance scheme, which will provide customers with insurance against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused to their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and car losses.
Here is a Council.
When you are under 25, it is in your hands to reduce insurance costs; that is how your credentials are increased by trying to be careful and to avoid accidents.
A credit is given to reducing the base tariff in the insurance company concerned.
On the contrary, a fine payment involves an increase in the tariff in question.
The amount of credits and fines paid depends on society and on its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments, explain Noguera.
Once the 25th anniversary mark has been exceeded, it will be easier for drivers to conclude a contract, because, with increasing driving practice, the number of accidents will fall.
The best way to go about this is to opt for full insurance with self-participation.
Young people are not normally able to benefit from their past experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of their journey, explained by the Spanish head of the European company, and added that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of operation, after the anchor fear of the anchor has been reduced.
However, it is more sensible for a married customer who does not have children to have full insurance; of course, only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
Insurers consider couples with children to be the least accident customers, and their contributions are accordingly low.
In this case, full insurance with self-participation (for EUR 300) would be the best option, and in the event of a high certificate being obtained, it is recommended that insurance be extended to cover the third year of the vehicle.
On the whole, they relax and have greater purchasing power, allowing them to make a higher contribution, Luis Noguera notes.
Pensioners are offered full insurance with their own participation (of the EUR 150) or extended insurance, which only takes place with a sufficiently high level of credit.
Finally, it must be said that car safety is a very important issue, not only because it protects drivers against possible accident damage, but also because it involves high costs, which require a thorough selection to be made that is in line with our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes for the eight-line final in Milan
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will be fighting in San Siro next Tuesday for the point they lack to achieve their respective objectives before the completion of the Champions-Governing Pre-round, which the Italians need to get to the top of their group while deciding on their participation in the Scots.
The Italian team has already five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with a decision in Portugal, while the Glasgow Celtic has another nine points to make sure that FC Shakhtar does not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with six points.
The two D matches will take place one week before the end of the sixth round of the round, as Milan will have to compete at the FIFA Klub World Cup in Japan, where on the 13th in the middle of the final, he will be fighting for the first time to enter the final, which will take place on the 16th.
This group will be closed before anyone else and the decision in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadion will be the result we all expect, even if both teams try to win, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home on the Celtic Glasgow, which they would have if there were a victory group first and therefore a better starting position in the eight-line finale.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be sufficient to qualify for defeat in a FC sleep at Shakhtar, but it should not be too reliant on such circumstances, because on nine points the Ukrainians are entitled to participate; they lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but they won at the second match (2-0).
So the mailors will try to lump the Scots in the evening and they again hope to reach the eighth end of the reformed championsleague for the second time in a row after being defeated by a caccoa gateway during the previous season in the same round, with a zero zero zero zero zero zero zero in the aftermath.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for the victory of Rossoneri оi, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the achievement of the eight-line finale and its membership of UEFA depend on its victory and a defeat for Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon, despite its lower profile and without the prospect of continuing to take part in the largest European championship, could gain third place by winning and thus play a part in UEFA.
Twenty thousand people are visiting the first Fice Girls Tour concert in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls in Vancouver in Canada gave the go-ahead to their first tour after the band was dissolved in 2000, in front of 20 000 viewers.
'Posh Spice '(Victoria Beckham),' Scary Spice '(Melanie Brown),' Baby Spice '(Emma Bunton),' Sports y Spice '(Melanie Chisholm) y' Ginger Spice '(Geri Halliwell) said just before the start of their concert in the stadion GM Place de Vancouver that the mood in the reunited band was marvellous.
Around 20 000 people were able to witness the concert in the stadion sold, where a video was shown on the history of the band, which was a furore at the end of the 1990s.
Reunification and world tourism are being duplicated with the publication of a new album, which includes its greatest hits and two other new songs, вHeadlines, and which appears in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wearing golden armies on the stage, which the husband of ¡Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham, previously gave them.
The sportsman was among the public fraternity who gave the blessing to GM Palace, even though his wife's nerves, Victoria, had banned him in the previous days.
As Victoria Beckham, while preparing for the fence, said that the British Sar has not seen our garderobe once, and I am therefore very curious as to what he will think about his appearance.
Her departure from the group in 1998, which, due to internal disagreements, led to the group being dissolved two years later, expressed her nervousness at a press meeting two hours before the concert.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of world public opinion had changed, that feelings had changed over the Spice Girls.
And that is why I did not really think so, so I am glad to have made this decision, Chisholm has made the distinction that made it nine years ago.
The seller also said that the disputes had been resolved and that everyone has now been happy to make changes.
However, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in Vancouver, following the report of the television station CTV, in a special Virgin Airlines aircraft.
On arrival at the airport, the bus was received by a army of nautical surgeons.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will be next in California, in San José (on 44th December) and in Los Angeles (on 5th and 7th December).
In Madrid, they will be on the stage on 23 December.
New concerns over the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of damaging Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are channelled through Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for gas, it will charge higher transit charges from Russia.
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is taking place at a time when the Ukrainian Government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine must be charged more, as the company has agreed to pay up to 50% more for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analyses say that this could mean that Ukraine would have to pay 40% more for Gazprom's imports.
'It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important host states in talks', said the Ukrainian Minister for Economic Affairs, Anatoli Kinakh, to the Reuters news agency.
'The changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments on the level of transit charges [to Western Europe] via Ukraine '.
During the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a case of exports to Western Europe, which has dramatically increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of them are underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supplies of gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS 'must control foreign workers'
The Scottish Public Health Service has to improve controls on the pre-judicial register of workers from outside Europe, a member of the control body outside Europe said.
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctorate in Scotland was brought into contact with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also raised concerns that the Scottish state health service had no precise ideas about the number of its foreign workers.
However, his report pointed out that other important controls were correctly carried out on a sample by five health authorities.
The main financial controller, recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area, went into the Glasgow airport as a result of the attack.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a commercial aircraft was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmissions in Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
It is expected that the state health service will carry out checks in advance of employing foreign personnel to ensure that they have the skills, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities in Disclosure Scotland use Scotland to check forgery registers, the Agency does not have competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main auditor's report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should take on board guidelines for the withdrawal of criminal records, which helps employers to carry out checks in different countries.
'Although we have found evidence of these controls in some of the documents on staff, they have not been carried out routinely '.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities were following their enquiry directives very closely before recruitment, but added: 'Our report identifies areas where the system could be improved to ensure accurate information about the number of foreign health services'.
BMA Scots Chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was' extremely unlikely 'that investigations prior to the recruitment of potential NHS personnel would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
'The report states that current NHS screening tests are working well for Scotland and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide ', he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1 161 foreign workers, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the Financial Controller warned that the number was probably higher, partly because the board of directors would have difficulty identifying those staff who were temporarily under review.
The inquiry also found that the established control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were mostly respected.
These include passport, work permit and qualification controls.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines for controls before the start of employment for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The Secretary of State for Health, Nicola Sturgeon, said: 'I was concerned about carrying out this work in the light of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport'.
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take account of the report's recommendations and would ensure that best practice would be reflected in updated guidelines on pre-employment monitoring examinations by all staff - including those from abroad - which are scheduled to be published next month.
Joy Division dominates the award of film prize
Control, film life over late Joy Division Sger Ian Curtis has classified five prices for the British Independent Film Scots, including the best film.
Prices have also been awarded to the main characters Sam Riley, who worked in a camp before being awarded the role of Curtis gecastet, the director Anton Corbijn, and the co-author Toby Kebbell.
Mrs Judi Dench was awarded the best possible job as chief Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond performers Daniel Craig won the fad for bringing British film to the world stage.
Prices were handed over at a ceremony in the Roundhouse of London.
Control follows Curtis's rise to glory with Joy Division to its suicide in 1980 at 23 years.
The Black Scots film - the soundtrack The Killers, David BoLike and New Order - has been turned for only GBP 3 million.
Nevertheless, he has brought two prices to the Dutch photographer Corbijn, who is the most well-known for the cultural Cover of the U2 Album Joshua Tree, as the best director and the best governor.
Rockmusics was the focus of another winner of the ceremony - Julian Temple's film on the Clash-Sver Joe Strummer was awarded the prize for the best documentary.
The prize for the best performer was Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia firm in David Cronenberg in London, Thriller Easter, who was playing.
Ray Winstone, who is in the reputation of playing hard candles, has won the prize for his outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old, whose film includes Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indian Jones Respiration The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said that he was proud to receive the prize named in honour of the Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
'It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me 'he said.
'I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He is my kind of man, a great actor of his time, I am truly honoured '.
Independent film prices, known as bifas, are selected by a group of film-makers, actors and festival organisers.

208 arrests in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist combustion system
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells, which had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant and on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle in missiles.
Friends of al-Qaeda have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 55,000 strong rapid reaction force to protect plant after a failed Al-Qaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to a statement by the Minister of the Interior, states that 18 of the detainees were part of a cell led by a 'missile expert' who entered the country illegally.
He reports that the military had planned to smuggle eight project tips into the Kingdom.
A further 22 of the detainees were reported to have been attempting to murder clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergy to do more to stop Saudi Arabia, which is seeking to join forces with al-Qaeda militias, which the Allied forces and the US-supported Shia Muslim Government are trying to combat, which the Hardliners consider to be heretical among Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias see many clergy in Saudi Arabia as working in cooperation with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda born in Saudi Arabia, to target it at the pro-Western Saudi government - are targeting foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
'This was a very great effort by the security forces over the last five months', a spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior informed state television.
The arrests also concerned a media cell from 16 Medina Ortega, which was aimed at promoting 'tactical thinking' - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims, which supports violence against Muslims branded as infidels and breakers.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could give us a glimpse of the world's future.
Venus was perhaps a pleasant place to live, according to scientists yesterday.
Data from a European naval cabinet on a runway show that the planet is even more like a shuttled tariff on the planet than was previously known.
Venus is the planet's nest planetary neighbour.
The two worlds are roughly the same in size and have similar planetary lines, but the sun's Venus is a little closer.
Billions of years ago, on Venus, conditions were very similar to those on earth and could even have been habitable, according to scientists today.
But because of the unbridled carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere from solar radiation and a slower rate of rotation, Venus proposed a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a superficial temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is being devastated by stormy winds and flash storms.
The findings of the Space sonde Venus Express of the European Space Agency, which has investigated the plans for one year, offer a sobering view of how the earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Physik department at Oxford University, one of the head of the Venus Express Mission, said: 'It is clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of the planet, whereas otherwise the planet is rather similar'.
'Our new data will enable us to construct a scenario in which the Venus started billions of years ago like the earth, possibly with an habitable environment '.
'enriched uranium 'confiscated by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said that three people were arrested and that the material was being tested.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but he said that it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (GBP 4080.000).
Everything still remains to be done.
Mr President, Mr Romey said that he does not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be consulted by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency ultimately agreed to take a debate on YouTube, where ordinary voters put questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, 28 November, were as ridiculous as the snow who questioned democrats about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions and the answers this time reflect exactly the state of the Republican Party that is going to go to the elections next year.
It is not known, just like CNN producers who supported the debate, who chose YouTube Clips, the candidate to be nominated.
However, during the first half hour of the debate, which was the longest devoted to a single issue, immigration was the focus.
This is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to serve a voter when they heard things they liked: the television station noted head of the consent when the candidates spoke strictly about borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who pushed ahead in the crucial polls in Iova and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation that he was soft on illegal immigration when he was Mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former Governor of Massachusetts of having hired illegal immigrants for work in his home.
The two were particularly controversial as they were asking whether one of the candidates would support an 'amnesty' (which would give illegal immigrants a regular status and the opportunity to citizenship).
Unimportant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, an Califor-Israeli Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Congressman from Colorado, managed to catch up on this subject.
Neither of the two men has any serious chance of nominating them, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have been more and more hardened than others in the immigration fence.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates broadly share the same views: tougher borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimise the differences between Liberals and Christian Conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether musty drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani's position that, although the Bible was its preferred book, it might not literally believe the history of Jonah and the Wal.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, contrary to expectations, at first place in a recent survey in Iova, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to support it, Jesus laughed at it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabees's rise in Iova coincides with Ron Pauls's recent donation and his adventitious storms in Wednesday's debate.
These two have been shot up from scratch because the two sides of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate party joined the party from the outset and convincingly with a winning message about the size of America and a winker on both sides.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour Party pain
Gordon Brown has found another glory to fall; his way out of it remains the same.
This is not particularly relevant to British scandals.
No avalanche bells appear to be sold, no politician in Paris pays for hotel bills, no out-of-marital visits.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has concealed donations to the British governing Labour Party over GBP 650 000 (USD 1, 3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report it, has been a good thing without the combative Gordon Brown.
When, two months ago, the Prime Minister withdrew the call for an election, insulting the British intelligence by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly vocal leader of Liberal Democrats, put it, the former feared Brown has developed from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a failing bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change tax laws have upset the government.
The loss of personal data by 25 million people by the authorities revealed unimaginable administrative rubbish.
A Trio of generals in retirement launched a uprising in the House of Lords in protest at cuts in military spending: they claimed to be a part-time job to be a minister of the armed forces.
Now there is David Abrahams's multiple donations; Peter Watt, Labour Secretary-General (and her former chief of compliance) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is going down the road of irrevocably.
However, governments can reach a turning point where they feel it is impossible to govern.
Neither like nor trust politicians, but normally they withhold their scepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation and he will not even have to be there for a long time, this delay is over: the public service is beginning to be intact; the cabinet ministers are beginning to loom; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and unfocused.
In one way, the position of Brown is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new Best.
However much he would deny Tony Blair, he was his legend.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax liability documents, for example, are related to decisions taken by Brown as Chancellor of the Treasury.
Even if it was not directly involved in Blair's misrepresentation - as in the long 'money for adelsticks' investigation of political party funding - the voters may well assume it was.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not as bad as it looks.
The wrongdoing is not as terrible as the Conservatives describe it.
As in Mr Bean, no one died or was completely deceived.
The remedy, painful as it may be, must be delivered on what Brown has always promised Stalinist tendencies, of course: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.
The new political posturing is a good example.
The garboesque Abrahams, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition of his goodwill.
That may be the case, but it was not up to him to decide.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for one clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about the Abraham agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask some questions; just as Jon Mendlesohn, the chief financial importer of laboratory money, was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far, Brown has not been involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about this confusion, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the law by his party, but he watered down that determination by walking towards a known instrument, a committee of inquiry into the subject, to take the measure, from a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the 'lessons to be learnt' are not very complicated.
When the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent committee on standards in public life, which has been vacant for six months, and moving forward with a radical reform of political party funding.
This would require Labour hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly to abandon the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party colleague like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have clear leadership in the polls; they have two years to win back voters; and the only way they can win is through indisputable honesty and sound competence.
Kartenhie
Is America's credit card market relevant?
When blood is in water, it is only natural that the discards of the back are stirred up.
Now that America's property market is shaking, predators are targeting the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach USD 99 billion if the risk of infection from underfunded loans spread to other forms of consumer credit.
Evidence of tension is clear.
There are increases both in the area of bookings and in the rates of default, which measure the proportion of the loans, which are neither recoverable nor more than 30 days too late.
Last month, the HSBC announced that it had deducted USD 1.4 billion from its US consumer financing, partly because of the weakness of credit-card providers.
It is too early to panic, however.
Losses and delays are still low.
According to the Moody credit rating agency, the third party default rate of 3% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in US private insolvency law in 2005 resulted in an abrupt case of bankruptcy claims, which in turn represent a large proportion of the loss of the Ceditcard; the number of applications (and thus default fees) would increase again, whether or not the general conditions for borrowers would deteriorate.
Industry also reports sound payment rates showing how much of its debt consumers pay each month.
and confidence in credit-card securities is fairly strong, despite the stalemate in other parts of structured funding.
Dennis Moroney from the Towergroup, a research company, calculates that the spending levels for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection between the property credit crisis and the credit card market are certainly available: it is more likely that consumers will take credit card debts, now that domestic loans are drying up.
However, cardholders look at the flow of money rather than at capital values, so falling skin prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
They can even be beneficial to the card manufacturers.
Incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates will fall if the property is less valuable than the loan; as a result, cartel debt among the repayment priorities will become more important.
Carpathians can also respond much more quickly and flexibly to the more stormy conditions as lenders by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid re-evaluation of the assets.
'We will not one day wake up and reassess the loans', says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones's main financial unit.
Even if a sudden crisis of collateral in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower skin prices and a reduction in credit force America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more pernicious future.
They are still looking for those shark fins.
British bankers are guilty in the Enron case.
Three British bankers, who were to be tried for their role in the fraudulent system with the former chief financial manager of Enron, Andrew Fastov, changed their pleas on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally pleaded innocent for seven cases of telecom fraud, allegedly colluding with Fastov in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was scheduled for January.
But during a hearing in court in the US dissident, Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone was guilty of a case of fraud involving the use of telecommunications equipment.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a Royal Bank of Scotland's Group PLC, were known in Britain during the two-year extradition process.
In the United States, their case is the end of an inquiry launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally levelled at them in 2002 were drawn to the attention of Fastov, who was the target of a government investigation into the Enron's downfall.
The charge against the bankers - called the NatWest Three - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to bail out a fraudulent plot with Fastov and his former chief adviser, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest invested in a subsidiary of Enron's partnership, controlled by Fastov, which was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron machinations that helped to drag the company into the bankrupt order.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its participation in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it was of considerable value in reality.
A company under control received the bank's share of the subsidiary for USD 1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper 250 000 dollars to take part in this company.
According to the charge, Fastov wrongly accused Enron of paying USD 20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact the USD 20 million went to British bankers, Fastov and others.
The bankers were given USD 7.3 million, while Fastov, Kopper and others were dumping USD 12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastov was known to be guilty of conspiracy in two charges for his role in Enron Pleite.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastov is serving a 6-year prison sentence in the federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free to bail out on the basis of a USD 1 million which required them to live in the United States pending trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the nation, collapsed in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks no longer allowed the debts of billions to be concealed or the weaker undertakings to appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than USD 2 billion pension plans.
The Enron-founder, Kenneth Lay, and former Chief Executive, Jeffrey Skilling, were sentenced last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lays sentences of conspiracy, fraud and other charges have been invalidated after he died last year for heart disease.
Not right down the ground in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, with a wheels-roy-engine engine and sufficient scope to fly without a name from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that is small money for some of the rich Russians.
'There is room for up to 18 passengers', as Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative said.
'But none of you ask for so many seats because it is for a private family or a business president '.
On Friday last, the company was at the Gulfstream stage at the millionaire exhibition, a four-day orgy of premeditated consumption, organised in a missing exhibition centre on the capital's outskirts.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibitions, hoping to interest newly-recovered Russians in everything, from mahagoni-getted yachs to excessive diamond grills, which would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firms carefully targeted a shining orange pork at the next measurement destination.
'This is a nice car, but it is a small amount compared with us', he said.
'After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft '.
Amid an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be flooded with money like Dallas in its belongings.
'We went through the same period in the 1890s when some Americans made huge profits and went to Europe in droves, where they were considered materialistic ', said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Centre for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
Like the 1970s Saudi Arabian overflights and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear to be the world's most visible freelance bankers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold exchange.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the Chair of LVMH, has attracted ideas on how to sell high-priced goods on markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organised by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company)
Russia has 53 billion dollars, a total of USD 282 billion, according to the forest list of the richest people.
In addition, 103.000 Russian millionaires are second class, costing USD 670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economists from the Economic and Financial Research Centre, a panel of experts here.
(The World Bank said that in 2005 15.8% of Russians were living below subsistence level)
'There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - that is why we are all here 'said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jewelier.
She had visited mass for the first time, together with the Russian trademark trader, Soho Jewelry's group.
'Women are all well cared for and men are all worth a fortune '.
While they are dragging through the halls on Sunday night night, two real estate mothers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millions.
'I looked at the cars and I try to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche ', said Mrs Yumatova, who gave the design clothes she wedged like a Rot Teppich-Veteran with Joan Rivers.
The mass seemed to be primarily aimed at the new entrants, the type of mark-conscious Russian buyers who would be prepared to spend several hours in a prison to visit a convenient storage room, which parochial Cadillac Escalades, pocket diameter made from Platin, furvenge icekrem, tailor-made low-cost, parking apparatus in Dubai and Geddybausals.
The public was able to buy tickets for EUR 30 (44457 dollars).
'The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best ', said Mr Gijrath, who was patriotic at a checkpoint of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft, in a relative imitate of a hand-rolling blue mosaic stunt.
'Of course, Russians are more interested in climate clients'.
Indeed, traders here are saying that with old money, Russians (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from grand logos to the kind of sober brand with limited unit numbers that would not be marketed in a commercial show.
Yet several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, were pressing through the hall every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the Show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, King Koil Betten's General Manager here, said that he had sold two 70 000 dollars of matratzensets made from Seide, Kashmir and cotton, with their stolen gold bands.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company providing the high-end cars with high-alerts systems, said that his company sold the greyorange orange pork to a Russian millionaire for USD 170.000.
Until Sunday afternoon Andrei Karapetian, the President of L.A@@. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to clients' wishes, said that he had sold three car freezers for a wheels-Royce Phantom, the interconnected tachograph, for a USD 55.000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tyre developed for a Russian casino owner, with snags he overrun with colourful Swarovski Kristalle, so it looked like a rouletterad.
The cost: USD 22 000 for a four-replacement.
'The Russian millionaire, the Old Rhine or the image of his wife's face from Cuban circuses will not necessarily travel on those wheels', said Mr Karapetian.
'He will keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage '.
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase 'Russian-millionaires' does not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in domestic property prices.
'If you bought a home in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash ', he said.
'There are more of them than you believe '.
Those who were not able to pretend to be rich at least in the situation of Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had four red telephone companies, modelled on the British model, packaged with mountains of false million-dollar banknotes.
Azad Karryev, the company's director of the marketing market, said his staff printed 500 000 false notes for the millionaire interest.
Passists stopped letting their friends bag in to throw the money, their mobile photos while sitting back in the middle of the spare wealth, or simply to pour in a few million.
'Look, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire ', said Mr Karryev.
Prevented operation in New Jersey is suspected of being killed
It was the day before the harvest ceremony that Ronald Livingston saw through the big glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and saw an ambulance on the white Cape Cod holding two doors further down the West Scott Avenue.
Soon after that there was a police car there.
Then there was another.
'Then I saw the catering car of the medical bodymaker ', said Livingston, a guest of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
'That was the point when I knew somebody had died '.
The authorities were told that the dead Mrs Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant of the Director of the Near Police Council.
Now the investigators are trying to establish whether they died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorised, cosmetic surgeons that the police did not identify and which worked in the House on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet established what caused the death of Mrs Arroyos and are hopeful that toxoological investigations, the results of which could not be available for weeks to come, will help to shed light on a mysterious death, which has been expressed by the leaders of the Near Police.
Mrs Arroyo has been an assistant of the Police Director, Garry F@@. McCarthy, since September 2006, and many of her voices were known in the department.
'She was loyal, hard working and stubborn ', said Mr McCarthy about Mrs Arroyo in a telephoninterview on Wednesday.
'It was my Pitbull.
She protected me '.
McCarthy said that Mrs Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for alcohol control composting, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a bull daughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for the Union County Public Prosecutor, Theodore J@@. Romankov, said that investigators would try to establish whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorised, surgical treatment.
'That is one of the options', said Mrs Walsh.
'It is an ongoing investigation '.
The authorities said that they had arrived at the House at around 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the ground.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have given little information about their investigation or about the brigade of the House, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs Castro was being consulted by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to establish whether part of the House has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs Castros's house, where a cloud rosenger is in the doorstep and a Dalmatine sheds behind the house.
A blue passport is written with 'Ethyl Vanillin' - used as a substitute for Vanille in food and perfumes - sitting next to a door that was knocked into the underground.
Two mountain bikes lying down of hake on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years of police département with New York, Mrs Arroyo was invaluable and helped him to find his way into the provincial and harsh political culture in his new town.
'She said, 'you must be careful of one thing or another', he said.
'She was always here when I arrived, and she was always here when I went.
It was embarrassing '.
Hopes which the Central Bank will lower interest rates will lead to an increase in world market markets
The shares yesterday ran aground on both sides of the Atlantic, following market expectations that the Central Bank will try to calm the credit markets by further cuts in interest rates, with reassuring comments from the US Central Bank's Vice-Chairman.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and the whole of Europe after Donald Kahn, Ben Bernanke's number 2, the President of the Central Bank, said that the policy must respond 'flexibly and pragmatically' to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure fragile markets, in the face of signs of emerging credit reassurances, Kohn said that the recent turbulence 'partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late in September and October'.
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the Central Bank is prepared to intervene and stabilise credit conditions with new injections of capital into the US markets and possible further reductions in interest rates.
The remarks also helped to reassure Wall Street, faced with further bad news from the US economy, now that sales of US property reached a record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence have been underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that they will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4% of their global workers, in a cost-cutting measure to offset heavy losses from their lost betting in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these posts will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1 500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industry Code was raised by 331 points, or 2.55% to close at 1.289.40, while the broadly-based S & P 500 index was increased by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE rose 100 indexes by 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6306.2, adding more than GBP 39 billion to the value of UK standard values.
Germany's index Dax rose by 2.6% and France's CAC40 rose by 2.3%.
Previously, the resurgence of credit pressure on the markets was highlighted, following the considerable demand for an auction of three months' guarantee guarantees from the European Central Bank granted to European commercial banks, which was a considerable 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to inject further capital into the money markets in London increased when credit outlay increased by three months of libor between UK banks, with 6.59% on their height since late September, following a steady increase since 21 November.
England faces a decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who is to score 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electoral president, is here, at the request of this particular title at least, to help the chief trainer Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan to decide on this, and because the table of High Morries, the English Managing Director, is gradually filling with applications for national electoral offices, if not for those in part-time time.
Anyone who does not get the sixth position of sludge will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to pinch exactly what enables a person to reach the top of his professional life, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of happiness rather than capacity.
It is not only in the crèche that it is difficult to choose, where judgments are needed, and these are always subjective in the end.
Is it the time to raise Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
The same question may also be asked in another area, for example whether John Edward or Tubby Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good qualifications who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player, unless they are given the opportunity to swim or go under?
Of course, figures have a major influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the neighbour's eye at the right time if he can take a game and a plaintiff must be given regular chances in order to make himself feel like a one-day cricket player.
It is more difficult to catch the eyes of the selectors.
There were many who were better than last season, for example, when James Anderson seemed to be playing in the first test, even though Stephen Harmison himself declared himself to be healthy and the wind is pouring into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wires each of 33 Rus to earn a position in that tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their fingers and they are hoping for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara is playing at the Asgiriya stage can only be a question of a view.
The choice could choose the careers of both men, or it may make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty was playing every test and successfully in the first, with five pitches and 40 useful rings, but it was Paul Collingwood who was still fighting to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough into a major test rioter and who, although he was a double hundred against Australia, is perhaps still underestimated.
It is likely that, following further discussion in the course of today's network meeting in Asgiriya, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, will be followed by their conservative instincts and feeling of building for Shahs with greater experience of Boparas's youth enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
Shah speaks for his funeral and valuable 88 Test Debate Institutes in Mumbay, 43 first-rate hundreds and only six of Bopara, 22 years younger, and an excellent balance against cured bullets.
But Shah only made ten Rus in his two intervals in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a Middlesex player, and that, plus his immediate refusal to accept the voter as a vaughan, was healthy to withdraw his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his jungle, which was still apparent in Mumbai.
On the other hand, the Essex all-crazy is a staggering lifeline.
He is not impressed by anything in a crèche and his attitude was put to the point where he recently overthrew a four-wheeled vehicle in an exhibition for England SpSponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his voice out of his mouth (which was also, of course, the scene) and to call his team colleague Alastair Cook to see that from the distance and to say with enthusiasm: 'Have you seen that?'
Bopara is a much better field player, he clicks his tempo of funds with some effect here on the fields of game, which seems to suit him and beats with confidence and skill.
To choose the right man is one thing, to choose the right time is another.
Perhaps that is the real art of choice.
I am inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be well off if, as the Ceylon Teesrate suggests, he is the one who will be playing here this weekend.
Businesses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Qaeda
The first Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose money or visa has run out, and others hoping that the city will return to normality.
Some even came back to fight the rebels who had expelled them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people from Damascus arrived in an official convoir of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
'I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad 'said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
'I came back today, because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad and how it would now be safe '.
You say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people ', he said that, in relation to the Shi 'ite militia of the militant clerical, Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be returned at this point in time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shi 'ite teacher from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime of Iraqis was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbours in Amariyah appealed to him to tell him that a local militia supported by the USA helped to drive al-Qaeda out of their bastion in the west of the capital and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite monster who had been driven from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with handgrenades after having asked his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
'Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they need my support and that of my boys.
That is why I returned today 'said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62nd.
Many people have said that they have been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the US troop increase and the growth of local 'groups', armed and defending their neighbourhoods in cooperation with the American military.
But more was said about being forced home by visa problems and the seeping funds in Damascus, to which more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed widespread suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian Government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled the sectarian death squads in the country.
'We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government stopped issuing visas to Iraqis to force them to return to Iraq 'said the Sunni pensioner.
'I cannot trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left '.
Part of the basic cause of the fall in violence is that Sunnis were driven out of Shi 'ite areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions had soared.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will fuel sectarian tensions and that there will be conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest Federal Republic leads the field in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in an educational field does the Saarcountries have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
'I 'declared yesterday, for the 50th time, to a non-Saaronian country that we are not French' - this slogan is the self-indulgent depiction of the smallest federal state on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which is fifth in the training survey of the Institute of the German Economics of Cologne (IW).
In this way, universities already cooperate closely with neighbouring countries from a tradition.
The University of SaarBrian was founded by the French in 1948.
To date, students here can complete their studies with a double or even three degree degree.
Accordingly, foreign students account for 15.6%.
However, national children also bring Saarland to higher education in more than average numbers - many of them without a degree at secondary school.
'In Saarland, you use the vocational education system ', says Axel Plünnecke, educational experts at the IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their study entitlement to a vocational school, which means that Saarland is more than seven percentage points higher than the federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training is also very much developed.
In terms of population, dual courses are the second best in Germany.
Despite the fact that training is close to practice and that demand is rising, the number of engineers has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education in Saint Saint Areas has now committed universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
'We have launched a number of reforms in general education schools following the first Pisa study ', says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
The government has introduced comparative tests at national level.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that other federal states are now copying with.
Only future comparative studies will show whether pupils' performance is improving in the long term.
In the case of Pisa 2003, the percentage of risk pupils fell from 29% to 20%.
Overall, however, the Saarland has not increased as much as other federal states.
The Bavaria is better off.
And, to the fun of the Saarcountries, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - otherwise we could have a few points in this area.
The language of neighbours is an obligation to Gymnasia, even if the Saarcountries are not French.
Chávez is stopping the watches
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon be ticking differently from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will have his time cake and eat it in South America by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez is becoming a laughing stock.
As the Venezuelan Official Journal said, according to a new law, the watches are closed for world time minus four and a half hours.
This will give the South American State a time zone which does not exist in any other country in the world.
The anti-US Chávez justified his decision by, among other things, the fact that the United States had imposed a full time division on the world.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with neighbouring Colombia due to a ghost affair.
The left national said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he would not have relations with either the Head of State or the Colombian Government.
'I cannot do this simply because of my dignity ', said Chávez, who is pushing ahead with constitutional reform, which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With reform, he would greatly increase his power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was Uribes' decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia with a view to releasing hostages.
Uribe 'turned a blind eye' to Venezuela's decision, criticised Chávez on Sunday.
Chávez is also on everyone's lips in Spain.
A new mobile bell blast in the country is making a furore: 'Por qué no te callas' (Why do you not stop your mouth) is the sentence that has already been downloaded from the Internet by more than half a million people.
His actions were taken by King Juan Carlos, Spain, who was free at the recent Ibero-American Summit from the constant interjections of the left-wing populist and who was drowned at his mouth.
Germans are threatened with a reduction in wages in 2007.
Despite the strong economic climate, German workers are likely to lose their real wages this year, according to a forecast.
Experts have given us a whole range of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to an estimate by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees could in real terms expect less pay in 2007 than they did last year.
'The fault lies with the modest wage trend, the increase in VAT and the price hikes in food and energy ', said Gustav Horn of the Institute for macro-economics and economic research in the' Bila 'newspaper.
Employees could also be subject to new burdens in the area of unemployment insurance.
The Finance Minister, Peer Steinbrück, said in the New Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance to 3.3% per annum is right and proper in the present situation.
However, the SPD politician was quoted as saying that the Federal Agency for Labour should not be put in a bad position again, having to ask for credit or subsidies when it was being formed.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the soaring food and oil prices had led to the highest inflation rate for 13 years.
Prices rose overall by 3.0% per year compared.
Venus is the world's hellish twin.
The Venus, despite its anti-life atmosphere on earth, is more similar than it was thought up to now: the European space song Venus Express has discovered Blitze in the atmosphere and wind fist to the Poles, as they are also appearing on earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it was on Venus St.
Now the Venus Express has produced the proof - it is felt electromagnetic waves on the margins of the atmosphere: the spectators on Venus are shooting around 56 kilometres from Wolke to Wolke, Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine.
According to the famous' priest theory ', Blitze has made life on earth: witter is said to have inspired reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so much on Venus: 'If ever there was life there, it must have been in the very early history', says Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly any living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times more dense than on earth, sometimes with temperatures of 500 degrees.
'Venus may be the earth's vicious circle, but it is a twin ', said Russel.
The basic issue of the Esai mission is why Venus, which is so similar to the planet in terms of quantity and size, has taken such a completely different turn.
The launch of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the early 1990s, no sun had been specifically deployed to research this planet.
The latest research results, which are now presented in various articles' Nature ', are not only, according to researchers, indicative of the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
'They also show that the common ground of our neighbouring planet is greater than it was initially thought ',' tells the essa.
Thus, in addition to the already known verbiage on the North Pole, researchers found a cloud bullet on the southern Pole that is turning much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air flows in the Irish winter hemisphere, according to a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second most internal planet of the solar system is almost the same mass as the earth and is almost as big, with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres.
The planet, also known as mortem or aboard, will be surrounded by the sun in less than 225 days.
But it is slower about itself: a Venice Day takes 243 days of earth.
Although Venus, with 460 degrees of celsius and 92 degrees of pressure, hardly ever reminds the world, scientists estimate that both planets have been created under very similar conditions.
Both of them brought together water which was still in oceans on the planet but lost in Venus.
While carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbonus confessions, it is on Venus that the majority of the atmosphere is.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
President Köhler is calling for an end to the party dispute for the Dalai Lama to be received by the Chancellor.
He implicitly criticised the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the September meeting.
President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's standing and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
'We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue ', said Köhler in the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, the Köhler showed understanding for the reception given by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September to the Dalai Lama.
'Human rights are universal for me, although I respect the diversity of cultures', said Köhler.
Everyone knew that Germany had to maintain delicate balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but protected Merkel from the accusation that she had a new China policy.
'The Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too, 'said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from within the Union.
One of the things that Mr Steinmeier complained about was the Union's' policy of slapping the wheels' in foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there was intense irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
The Chinese leadership not only invited the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to information from the SPIEGEL, frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
China's leader Wen Jiabao has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China refuses to accept official European politicians welcoming the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the wider Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns against riots, as in France
street battles involving the police, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots, as in France.
Every effort should be made to prevent social discontent in Germany from degenerating into violence on the streets, as the Federal Minister of the Interior has requested.
Barrique hoots burned the police with hooligans shot at the police with scrappage liners: following the severe youth riots in France, the Federal Minister for the Interior, Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU), feared a similar development in Germany.
'We must ensure that we do not also build up social explosives in our own countries and that we do not expose them to violence.
We must take it seriously, as he said in the New Press that appeared in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
Bands, countries and local authorities have already worked hard to reduce problems, as the Schäuble has said.
This is not only about the integration of migrants.
'From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, this is already beginning to show signs of success'.
However, it is too early to give a warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that there were no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs, as in France.
Young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Cars and public buildings were also burnt in Toulouse.
However, the Federal Government's President of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts.
In the face of the riots in France, colat warned of 'imitation effects'.
The situation in Germany is not as critical as in France.
However, we still need to act.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people of a migrant background under 25 was' above average '.
More training places should be provided.
Mr Kolat said: 'We must give young people a future'.
The President of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany, more than in France, 'social control in the family takes place'.
Many young people of a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents built up here.
Kolat warned: 'but we must be careful'.
We must 'give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training'.
Meanwhile, during the night, the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel in Paris remained largely quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were in operation, a helicopter overflying the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests and a few burning rubbish dustbin and cars.
Since the previous day, a rental of around 1 000 security forces has brought peace.
The police will take action as long as necessary, the Home Secretary Michelle Alliot-Marie announced that she would go to the suburb.
During the night of Tuesday, some 80 police officers were injured at riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The consequence was the unrest in Toulouse.
The riots broke out in a road accident in which two young people died on Sunday.
According to the preliminary findings of the Public Prosecutor, the police are not to blame for the deaths of young people.
Angela Wolke Empire
The Chancellor's unrealistic performance demonstrates that the coalition is at the end of the day in terms of content - and that nothing can be expected of it.
Which country does this Chancellor actually live in?
After her dismal appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was both muddled and poor in content, it has to be said that it is not here - not in the country that it should finally govern.
The accusation that it focuses too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with a somewhat arrogant phrase.
That is a parochial state, she said, and it showed that she did not want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Bundestag, it showed everyone how true their accusations are.
There was no concrete interest, nor any feeling at all, of the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke stood up: a deposed politician who is fleeing foreign policy and who is remaining in the safe environment even there.
Take the example of climate protection: it is openly praising the decisions of Heiligendamm, but it does not say how far the climate targets should be achieved.
In fact, self-praise - so much modesty would have been the failure of the CDU leaders two years ago.
Now it is clinging to the rhetoric that the people are starting to recover.
In so doing, she is damaging her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of making the world look good.
But in Angela Wolke's empire, domestic problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low earners?
She has a few additional points for this.
It is significant how much it promises to do with the addition of children.
Chancellor Merkel needs three courses of action to get a half-way sentence.
It will stumbling as if it were on a foreign level when it comes to concrete action.
Attacke section
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two Faites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough battle - and are now afraid of an outsider's data.
The tense of the candidates is already apparent from the first topic.
He has made New York a 'refuge for illegal immigrants', and Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
He, for his part, has been full of serious accusations: 'I would say his own house was a port for illegal immigrants', he has said Giuliani and accuses the former Governor of Massachusetts of having employed privately undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are blaming: because the Republican base still does not have a clear fait, the eight presidential candidates are using the CNN debate mainly to discredit its opponents.
The self-manipulated 30-hour videos sent by Internet users via YouTube are hardly more than picking pools.
'We have allowed Hitler to power with this kind of isolationism ', John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, the only person in the round who is demanding immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, is heavily reading the levitas from the Vietnamese veteran, refusing to condemn as torture what is known as' waterboarding ', a method of interrogation that simulates drowning.
However, the reactions of the Saalysts in St Petersburg in Florida show that the campaign's important issues are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are extolled and future tax increases rejected, there is applause in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two flaws lie.
'I was wrong then ', Romney sneaked in tears and makes a plea to the public at grassroots level for being one of the pro-abortion supporters in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is a fool when he is asked his opinion on the sacrosanct interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf is in princess for the first time.
The day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani leader, Mr Musharraf, was sworn in as President.
This will put an end to eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television passed the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad live.
Musharraf hailed to respect the Constitution and to act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as army chief to his confidants Ashfaq Kiyani, thereby yielding to international pressure, particularly from the USA.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former General now governs for the first time as a civilian head of state.
In his resignation as the army's chief commander, Musharraf had met a core demand from the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his sworn, General Musharraf, according to Public Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, will lift the state of emergency and thus satisfy another Western demand.
Last week, the Supreme Court of the country occupied by Musharraf's legal advisors following the declaration of a state of emergency at the beginning of November had rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers have been killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of the heat-trock are returning.
Germany's 1970s super-group is again muzzling: the three Bandys of Harmonia were again faced with their bankruptcies at a concert in Berlin.
As far as the Revival is concerned, a halfway through its great time, Live 1974.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The sensationation that is to be held will take place in the form of three legislative gentlemen at the evening board.
Everyone has his cage, his cables and, above all, his buttons in front of him.
Dieter Moebius thront in the white shirt in the breadth of the city, at 63 years.
Links are accompanied by Michael Rother, 57 years of age, and with Laptop and Gitarre.
Right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is concentrated in the console.
Everyone is noise, and sometimes even a commandment.
And sometimes it accidentally adds up to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves much.
The fact that the band Harmonia is musizing again has caused a certain amount of excitement among Krautrock songs.
What we can reveal here is that targeted enquiries showed that the name was muddling through collective pop scorning, but not so sustainable, in order to make this band painfully missing for 32 years.
Why, though, should Germans not be allowed to celebrate their living legend from the seventies?
This is all the more true in England and America, which is misleading Krautrock, as it is in their own country.
When the music industry passed the Echo-Price for Life's work to the survivors of the Cologne Group in 2003, people in the Chamber saw in the German pop valley in question.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the Bands La Düsseldorf and Neu in Laudatio, the surprise was beyond bounds.
In concert Michael Rother later hosted the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the scene like an old rubber.
The problem of ignorance at home and of declaration in the foreign is one.
Harmonia's memory is too much to remember, because the trio only existed for two years and during that period it also had a much less powerful effect than others have subsequently allocated to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had already been musized with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name of cluster.
First of all, they were playing in the cellar under the Berlin display.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, for a label held by the Church.
Rother had helped the power station for a short time and then became a Gitarrist with New! The German group, which was perhaps the most radical at the time, was known to be.
However, in 1973 Rother followed the cluster music music in exile to the West Minster.
They lived there, in the Old West, a ruins from the 16th century, as local local lords who were deafed.
Less ideologically than in the municipality I, where Roedelius was still allowed to be a nanny.
It is in the peak art's dawn.
It is said that a mockery of the Geshange Association Harmonia Ottenstein and the art were found in the sperm waste.
Some people have said Harmonia is wrong.
The first Album was called 'Harmonia Music' and the following 'De Luxe'.
For music was so calm and humble that the band suffered material hardship.
Travel gathering was not just about self-invention.
The now published CD 'Live 1974' was cut off at a giant in Griessem, before a record cake of almost 50 members, as some people think they can recall.
Rother then wanted to force Harmonia and occasionally to practise it.
Roedelius and Moebius are immoral in their demands.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in Esoter-Spharsher and secured its existence with alpes like flame hearts.
Clusters have been revived in the eighties and have since been more successful than Harmonia ever has been.
The flu Livealbum is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland set itself the objective of nurturing the hewer trock as a supreme German contribution to living music.
New, it has already been buried like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurgence of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of Cultures of the world.
Public subsidies, in the context of the festival Woldtronic.
Julian Cope is here, the Briton, Altpunk and the author of the handbook 'Krautrock Sampler'.
There is also Dr Motte, the local parademy.
Womit would have outlined the whole range of the influence of the helicopter on the subsequent pop music.
Harmonia is filling the supergroup leather supergroup.
Brian Eno's phrase is hanging with the most bizarre shounds in the Chamber: 'The only true music, you have the future'.
There are images that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm.
Legenics serve as further black photographs of hardware sold.
Before that, the three veterans are again working on improvisation.
No longer by using microphones to coax the orange and the boxes to extract an unheard tone from the instruments on self-stamped efficiency devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three technical filters.
The House's chorus does not change that either.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgensten, people are cooked and shouted, and sung in a beautiful place with the empire of Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never a rock.
The roots were sought less in the blue than in music colleges (Can), technologies (power stations) or the flight from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Those who call '68!' are not completely wrong, and Harmonia is not now allowed to be released from this.
The most obvious of these is the matter being thoroughly reconsidered on the stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can take a nerve or a fudge.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
The Hunting Party and the 'Murder Peace' are two more films on the Balkan war.
Neither of them are convincing, however.
Either the concepts focus too much on action and on mountains, or they are too rebuffing.
Richard Gere in The Hunting Party cannot help here either.
The good news first is that, although war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, it is precisely there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because too many naked roles in friendly films for women and too many press conferences on Buddhism are a cause for concern.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument for 'The Hunting Party - when the hunters become a poisoned' (Why, in fact, do filters have to be as long and muddled as train wage agreements?).
He is a shining illustration of the fact that his warmonger Simon Hunt is basically what could have become of his gift if fate and the film industry were not so charming: a man who has long been through his best times but who, even as a ruthless monument to his death, has still saved considerable remains of the former charm.
But despite this gamble, 'The Hunting Party', together with the German production of 'murderous peace', which is also starting this week, is continuing only the endless series of failed Balkan warfare films.
'Murder peace 'can be used in a short trial: the film is made by two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who are saving a Serb from Kosovar hedgerows, on which one person soon loves himself.
Although it is good that the Serbs are not being presented as the sole cause of all evil, the TV flavour is too quickly losing in the mountain and in action.
It remains a kind of 'warning for Cobra 11', but war on it without a motorway.
On the other hand, the Hunting Party can be an example of why there has never really been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three US war reporters who set out to trace the Serbian supreme war-breaker 'of the fox' could have become a new 'Apocalypse Now' at another time with another director and another hysterical bookkeeper (both in Richard Shepard's Staff Union).
The stories are remarkably similar: both small teams go to the forest to carry out something that the military cannot do, and both these times it will be a journey to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of the Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not simply left with the heart of the sinister cynic as he was presented to us at the beginning.
No, the Script has to contend with a romantic affair involving a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
The Hunting Party will end up going down the drain if, within the last five minutes of the time pile, the reporters manage what Nato, CIA and all the world's head-moneys failed in five years: catch the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslim Bosnians to a fair vengeance.
This is so bad that it is intended to bring the International Court of Justice in The Hague to court for crimes against cinematographic companies.
The film has a profoundly human purpose.
He wants to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still freely in circulation, and he does not suspect the Americans and the French (here they should be in agreement for once) of being too heavily involved in persecution for the sake of secret political agreements.
But the good sense and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian dawn in the poet: 'Complete the descended flavours, implicit: how tiring it is to be evil'.
Films such as The Hunting Party have just such threshold brains, but they indicate how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan warmongering.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraqi films Hollywood were big floops.
One might add that there has never been a good South African film.
It almost always seems that, when a bar drives on the world's trouble spots or minefields, it is as if it were a Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, 'Beyond all borders' with Angelina Jolie or 'blood diamonds' with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all the conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, it took decades for Hollywood to turn a good film on the Holocaust with a 'Sindler List'.
Some film will probably still mature - the Vietnam works now classed as' The Deer Hunter ',' Apocalypse Now 'or' Full Metal Jackett 'were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps we know too much today about the conflicts in the world, when every mass murder in real time comes at home on two screens.
And that takes away from the hull bookshop operators the thoughtlessness they need to tell good stories.
'Project or non-existence 'or' the great dictator 'have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaвdid not know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Perhaps we should not want to be good if we want to make good films.
Perhaps we need to have the strangely distanced artistic sight of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historic novel 'Lemprières Wörter' and the Balkan war, he replied: 'This is only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way and war will always be waged in Yugoslavia. '
Criticism of Olympia is received with bated breath.
The departure of the mayor from Hamburg's bid for summer Olympic Games has been severely criticised by politicians and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the water games.
But we are calling for realism in assessing the opportunities.
On Wednesday, the chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described renunciation as' not good for the business location '.
No other project has recently developed as many motivating forces in the city as the Olympic ideal.
'Without this objective, the impetus to sports policy would not be able to be maintained to the same extent '.
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to burial the project but to find a new long-term approach 'based on a changed time frame'.
Mayor Ole von ust stayed on Wednesday with previous statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic, at least until 2028.
'It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Union ', said by ust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports College, expected at the beginning of December, to apply for Munich for the winter games 2018.
'This preference means that we will not have any realistic chances in the period up to 2028 that we have been considering so far '.
Yet the dream was not dreamt of for ever, as was said by pleasure.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) lamented the testimonies of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer be competing for the Olympic Games over the next 25 years.
'It is too early to deny an opportunity by already buying the plans at that point ', said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
Abolishing the application also contradicts the statement made by the head of the Senate on a reception to the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
There, by popular taste, the application by Hamburg for Universiade 2015 did not refer to the 'replacement' of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association only last week nominated Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD Civil Society Group accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
'The development of the small Grasbrook was delayed by the Senate for years because it took the Olympia card and excluded housing ', said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the small Grasbrook to have integrated planning for Olympia and later housing, the CDU has unilaterally opted for the 'contingent factor'.
Application for the 2012 Olympic Games had aroused great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, failed on Leipzig.
These are not Warhols Kists.
Those who combine the concepts of Sweden and the wood tapes think of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or is that?
At present, wood carrots manufactured in Sweden are casting dark shadows on the Warsaw's work register.
A large proportion of the 440-strong boxes of Stockholm that are listed there are counterfeit ones.
After the Swedish newspaper 'Expressions' a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxen in 1968, internal investigations in Moderna Museet in Stockholm are now reaching a sobering conclusion: the six 'Brillo-Boxes', which the former Museum Director Pontus Hultén has made available to Mona Museet in 1995, are copies - and perhaps the majority of the hundreds or so other 'Brillo-Boxes' of the type Stockholm 'that are circulating on the international art market.
The background is muddled, a confusing set of artistic and Kurdish productions.
Warhol created its first 'Brillo-Boxes' in New York in 1964, weaned wood whistleblowers based on the red blue white design of the 'Brillo' cardboard cardboard cardboard.
An exhibition of his work in Moderna Museet in 1968, with Warhols' agreement, included hundreds of brillo-Kists from Pappe: they did not come from Warhol (for reasons of cost), but were delivered directly from the Brillo-Cartono factory.
They were not works of art, but their role models, they were just exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol probably allowed a few brillo-wood whistles to be produced in Sweden in 1968, but they were not issued in Mona Museet.
Timorese are now talking about around 15 Kists, who were then authorised original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes called 'Type Stockholm', and rightly entered the history of art and auction.
Some of them have earned more than USD 100 000 at auction.
The problem is that the legendary Museum director Pontus Hultén later wrongly claimed that some 100 timber timber timber timber products had been produced and issued in Sweden in 1968 and was then left to Warhol.
In fact, Hultén 105 Kists were not produced in Malmö until 1990 for an exhibition in St Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol was dead three years ago.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator on Moderna Museet, has also examined three of the museum-constituted Brillo-Boxes from Swedish private property, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press galleries were first cleared and closed, and then white oil colours were burnt with a pile.
The structure of copies, on the other hand, in 1990 betrays the fact that the paint with a paint was placed directly on the press plate without any basic authorisation - and it is not oil but flavour.
'These cists were not authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes', the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, says: 'If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, Mona Museet will classify the six Kists in its collection as copies / exhibitions'.
However, as early as July, the Authenation Board announced that it would investigate the 'serious accusations' that have been made about the 'soap powder Curricula'.
Since then, however, they have remained implacable.
Reading soldiers in Manila are giving up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have given up, sheltered in a Manila hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot be responsible for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused President of corruption and electoral fraud, who was reporters in the hotel.
Governmental soldiers previously stormed the hotel under tear-gas operations.
The two or so soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them were on Thursday in court - among them Trillanes - for a failed coup attempt in 2003.
He used the negotiation to suddenly put up with some 30 sympathisers.
The military police officers who were supposed to be monitoring him were apparently overrun to him and followed his muttery.
They have been dragging into the Peninsula-Hotel and demanding the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyalist government troops closed the district around the hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the security cabinet.
The national security adviser, Norberto González, condemned the actions of the soldiers.
'People have enough 'said Trillanes.
'We call on people to join us'.
General Danilo Lim, who previously ruled the elite unit of the Scout Range, said that other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Critics of the government had called for major demonstrations against the President on Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for months.
Manilas Financial district was the main scene in 2003 of the attempted mutiny of around 200 soldiers against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after less than 24 hours because of the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986, at least seven attempted coup d 'état has been carried out against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in the publishing sector
The Internet has secured a share of more than 20% of the company in the telecommunications sector.
The average price per share is EUR 14.46, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
We are now living on 20.05% of the basic capital.
There was prior speculation about a takeover.
The option is still open of increasing the proportion of the waste.
The move is to consolidate the German DSL-market, with United Internet.
Previously, on Wednesday, there were already suspicions of a take-off, after the Berenberg Bank increased its participation in the decot of network operators by a further 5% to 15.1%.
The House of Money considers the shares to be only a third party, as it was called in the financial market.
The day before that, the United Internet had already been involved in the Drillisch mobile phone company with just under 10%.
In the context of an increase in capital, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
5.15 million shares of this kind have been purchased by the United Internet for EUR 31.4 million.
Companies have also started talks on marketing cooperation for SLs and mobile telephony products.
'We are strengthening our partnership 'was explained by a United-Internet spokesman.
The two companies have set up the Community company MSP to take over the rival Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with a share of over 10% of freenet and do not want to make use of their right to take on another 18.49% of freenet, United Internet joined on Thursday.
However, both companies remained open to all options, particularly to further increase their participation in Freenet AG, as they were told.
Talks between the Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had been concluded in mid-November.
The Freenet poker, which has been going on for months and has been difficult to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile phone contract customers at the end of the third quarter and 1.27 million DSLs and Complete TSG customers.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch has so far kept 6.01% of the freenet shares directly.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring a further 4% or so.
The right to purchase 18.49% from Vatas, the investment company, was agreed back in August.
