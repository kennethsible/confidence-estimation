doc100	1	In emergency medicine and intensive care the key to control active bleeding - besides definitive therapy (endoscopy, therapeutic angiography or operation) - often is to improve the patients clotting and thrombus formation.
doc100	2	Knowledge about routine laboratory testing, their strength and weaknesses as well as indications and dosing of pro-coagulants and blood products remains pivotal in these situations.
doc100	3	Achieving hemostasis can be especially challenging in patients with liver cirrhosis, innate or acquired coagulation disorders.
doc100	4	This review summarizes the principles of hemostasis diagnostics and management in acute bleeding for gastroenterologists and hepatologists including novel available antidotes and innovative tools for patients with advanced liver disease such as thromboelastometry.
doc12	1	COVID-19 represents a clinical situation that lacks precedence and clinical experience.
doc12	2	It introduces a number of pitfalls in well-established clinical routines and poses unique challenges to diagnostic pathways.
doc12	3	This review discusses the current evidence on the thromboembolic risk of COVID-19 patients, the recommendations for thromboprophylaxis and the relevance of abnormal coagulation tests.
doc12	4	Pathophysiological concepts are discussed and practical solutions and current guidance recommendations are presented.
doc13	1	It is the aim of the Medical Informatics Funding Scheme and other national and local projects for digital networking in healthcare to facilitate the exchange and use of patient data between institutions in compliance with data protection regulations.
doc13	2	This requires the integration of data from various sources-such as digital workplace systems, laboratory systems, picture archiving and communication (PAC) systems or tumor boards-into a data warehouse or research databases.
doc13	3	Digital networking of service providers and research institutions will open access to high-performance and precision medicine (e.g., virtual molecular tumor boards) for even more patients, thereby providing data for basic and care research.
doc13	4	Network medicine will establish the translational link between basic research (e.g., genome research) and patient care.
doc13	5	Digitally integrated "real world" patient data will also facilitate a detailed analysis of health care and the quality of treatments.
doc14	1	In the last decade, artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have been more and more established for the screening and detection of diseases and pathologies, as well as for describing interactions between measures where classical methods are too complex or fail.
doc14	2	The purpose of this paper is to model the measured postoperative position of an intraocular lens implant after cataract surgery, based on preoperatively assessed biometric effect sizes using techniques of machine learning.
doc14	3	In this study, we enrolled 249 eyes of patients who underwent elective cataract surgery at Augenklinik Castrop-Rauxel.
doc14	4	Eyes were measured preoperatively with the IOLMaster 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec), as well as preoperatively and postoperatively with the Casia 2 OCT (Tomey).
doc14	5	Based on preoperative effect sizes axial length, corneal thickness, internal anterior chamber depth, thickness of the crystalline lens, mean corneal radius and corneal diameter a selection of 17 machine learning algorithms were tested for prediction performance for calculation of internal anterior chamber depth (AQD_post) and axial position of equatorial plane of the lens in the pseudophakic eye (LEQ_post).
doc14	6	The 17 machine learning algorithms (out of 4 families) varied in root mean squared/mean absolute prediction error between 0.187/0.139 mm and 0.255/0.204 mm (AQD_post) and 0.183/0.135 mm and 0.253/0.206 mm (LEQ_post), using 5-fold cross validation techniques.
doc14	7	The Gaussian Process Regression Model using an exponential kernel showed the best performance in terms of root mean squared error for prediction of AQDpost and LEQpost.
doc14	8	If the entire dataset is used (without splitting for training and validation data), comparison of a simple multivariate linear regression model vs. the algorithm with the best performance showed a root mean squared prediction error for AQD_post/LEQ_post with 0.188/0.187 mm vs. the best performance Gaussian Process Regression Model with 0.166/0.159 mm.
doc14	9	In this paper we wanted to show the principles of supervised machine learning applied to prediction of the measured physical postoperative axial position of the intraocular lenses.
doc14	10	Based on our limited data pool and the algorithms used in our setting, the benefit of machine learning algorithms seems to be limited compared to a standard multivariate regression model.
doc2	1	The recently updated 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias set new, ambitious goals for lipid lowering based on recently generated evidence from large outcome trials.
doc2	2	Noninvasive imaging as well as measurement of lipoprotein(a) as a non-traditional risk factor is advocated for the refinement of risk stratification.
doc2	3	A highly potent statin - defined as a drug that lowers LDL-cholesterol by 50 % from baseline - is recommended as the standard choice of treatment, whenever medical lipid lowering is indicated.
doc2	4	Combining different therapeutic strategies such as a statin with ezetimibe and/or a Proproteinkonvertase Subtilisin Kexin Type 9 inhibitor allows to achieve the new treatment targets.
doc2	5	If needed, lipid apheresis can complement the medical armamentarium.
doc2	6	Moreover, lipid apheresis remains the only approved treatment modality for lowering lipoprotein(a), however medical treatments are under current investigation.
doc20	1	Large, persistent or chronic macular holes still represent a surgical challenge, which can be addressed using the presented surgical technique.
doc20	2	A subretinal injection of balanced salt solution (BSS) at the posterior pole of the macular region is performed during transconjunctival pars plana vitrectomy in order to induce an elevation of the neurosensory retina in the macular region.
doc20	3	The hole is then attenuated during fluid-air exchange, followed by a gas or silicone oil tamponade.
doc20	4	The presented technique appears to be useful for large and persistent macular holes, which are not suitable for conventional macular hole surgery.
doc20	5	The exact patient information on the potential outcome of surgery in this specific group of patients seems particularly important.
doc27	1	Despite the high effectiveness of direct-acting antivirals for the treatment of hepatitis C, a small proportion of patients do not respond to approved regimens.
doc27	2	The combination regimen of SOF/VEL/VOX was recently approved for patients with failure to prior NS5A-based treatment.
doc27	3	In this German real-world cohort including patients with cirrhosis
doc27	4	(27.3 %) and previous decompensation events, 12 weeks of SOF/VEL/VOX resulted in high virologic response rates irrespective of disease severity and prior DAA regimen.
doc27	5	Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate and comparable to those seen in the approval studies.
doc3	1	We compared the natural multicomponent, multitarget therapy SUC (Solidago compositum ad us. vet., Ubichinon compositum and Coenzyme compositum, Heel GmbH, Baden-Baden, Germany) to the well-known angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril in a prospective, observational, nonrandomized, two-arm cohort study of cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
doc3	2	The objective was to assess the tolerability and the effectiveness of SUC in cats with CKD.
doc3	3	One hundred thirty-six cats were screened for CKD, and 70 cats were eligible for the study.
doc3	4	Thirty-three cats were assigned to the SUC treatment, and 35 cats received benazepril.
doc3	5	All cats were diagnosed with CKD.
doc3	6	The follow-up period was 168 days.
doc3	7	Response was assessed as an improved or stable serum creatinine from baseline to the end of the study.
doc3	8	Additionally, a clinical summary score, as measure of quality of life, was evaluated.
doc3	9	Serum creatinine remained close to baseline in both study groups with slightly improved values in the SUC group.
doc3	10	The clinical summary score improved significantly in the SUC group on days 3, 7, 28, 56 and 112, but not on day 168.
doc3	11	Within the limitations of the study, the results carry implications for the usefulness of SUC as an interesting new treatment option for feline CKD.
doc3	12	The results indicate that SUC might be more effective if given at least twice weekly.
doc30	1	The pathogenesis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a complex and multistage process which results from the interaction of exogenous and endogenous cellular processes.
doc30	2	Each of these processes leaves a characteristic pattern of mutations on the tumor genome, a so-called mutational signature.
doc30	3	The subject of current studies is to decipher specific signatures of mutational processes operating during HNSCC pathogenesis and to address their prognostic value.
doc30	4	Computational analysis of genomic sequencing data by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed mutational signatures 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 13 as the main players in HNSCC pathogenesis.
doc30	5	Signature 16 was first discovered in human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative oral and oropharyngeal tumors.
doc30	6	In many studies, an association of signature 16 with alcohol and tobacco consumption as well as with an unfavorable prognosis was described.
doc34	1	Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is produced in the liver and binds to different complex receptor/coreceptor systems.
doc34	2	Besides many other processes, FGF21 regulates the intake of simple sugars and alcohol.
doc34	3	Increased levels of FGF21 decrease harmful alcohol intake in mice.
doc34	4	To increase our understanding on the relationship between FGF21 and alcohol intake in humans, we aimed to measure FGF21 levels in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) in comparison to patients with nonalcoholic liver cirrhosis (NALC) and healthy persons based on their present alcohol consumption.
doc34	5	Alcohol intake was verified by urinary ethyl glucuronide (uETG) levels, eating and drinking behaviour by a Food Frequency Questionnaire and FGF 21 plasma levels were determined by ELISA in 96 persons (ALC n = 41; NALC n = 34; healthy n = 21).
doc34	6	Both ALC and NALC patients with elevated ETG levels (≥0.5 μg/ml; indicating alcohol consumption in the last 12-72 h) showed significantly higher FGF21 plasma levels in comparison to patients with negative ETG levels.
doc34	7	Eating behaviour did not have an impact on FGF21 plasma levels.
doc34	8	Increased FGF21 levels in patients with recent alcohol consumption (verified by ETG) confirmed the first part of the liver-brain endocrine axis: alcohol consumption was associated with increased FGF21 levels.
doc34	9	We could not confirm that elevated FGF21 levels were associated with reduced alcohol intake as a result.
doc34	10	That points towards a pathology in this pathway, which might be caused by a malfunction of β‑Klotho or FGF receptors according to other studies and chronic alcohol dependency.
doc34	11	Further research is required to clarify these pathologies, which may open new pharmacological treatment for patients with alcohol use disorder and alcohol dependence.
doc38	1	Canine atopic dermatitis (cAD) is a common inflammatory and pruritic skin disease, with various treatment options.
doc38	2	The use of topical products containing natural ingredients has proven increasingly popular.

doc38	4	Ten privately owned, mildly affected, nonseasonally atopic dogs.
doc38	5	The spray was applied to the ventrum every 24 h for 28 days.
doc38	6	Clinical scores, skin barrier function and owner assessment were evaluated on day (D)0, D14, D28 and D42.
doc38	7	The cutaneous microbiota was analysed on D0 and D28.
doc38	8	A reduction in the total clinical score was seen at each time point (D14, P = 0.03; D28, P = 0.04; D42, P = 0.001).
doc38	9	A reduction in the regional clinical scores was seen after D28 (P = 0.01) and D42 (P = 0.003).
doc38	10	A significant reduction in the pruritus score was seen on D42 (P = 0.01).
doc38	11	A lower hydration value was seen on D28 (P = 0.02) and D42 (P = 0.02) on the pinnae.
doc38	12	A good-to-excellent response and an easy-to-use administration was reported by owners.
doc38	13	There were no significant changes in the cutaneous microbiota after 28 days.
doc38	14	There was a significant and rapid decrease in the clinical signs associated with cAD after use of the spray.
doc38	15	Future larger, randomized, controlled studies are needed to confirm these results and to assess the effects on the cutaneous immunity and microflora of atopic dogs.
doc39	1	of the study is to research the epidemiological aspects of maternal alloimmunization against erythrocyte antigens of fetuses (AB0, Rhesus, Lewis, Kell, Duffy and others) and to identify the most common types of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in the West Herzegovina region.
doc39	2	The 20-year retrospective epidemiological study includes all pregnant women who had been immunologically tested and newborn treated for HDN.
doc39	3	The indirect antiglobulin (IAT) detected antibodies against antigens in 545 (1.8%) pregnant women of the 29 663 who were tested at the Department of Transfusion Medicine.
doc39	4	During the 20-year-long study 310 (1.0%) newborn with HDN were treated.
doc39	5	Our results indicate that 42% (230/545) of the pregnant women had AB0 immunization.
doc39	6	The most common form of HDN is AB0 HDN 64% (199/310), whereas RhD HDN was treated in 19% (59/310) of the newborn infants.
doc39	7	ETR was performed on 29 (19%) infants, 21 (72.4%) with AB0 HDN, and 7 (26%) with RhD HDN.
doc39	8	This 20-year-long study concludes that, even though there has been significant progress in the prevention of immunization and proactive treatment of HDN, precautionary measures are still required as is the need for gynecologists and obstetricians to be active.
doc39	9	The reasons for this are the non-existence of preventive measures for non-RhD immunization, the irregular immunological screening of RhD positive women in pregnancy in the region encompassed by the study in the past few years.
doc39	10	The above raises new questions and recommends further research and monitoring of immunization and HDN treatment worldwide.
doc41	1	Work-related medical rehabilitation is a multimodal interdisciplinary approach to reduce health-related discrepancies between work capacity and job demands in order to achieve work participation, especially for patients with severely more restricted work ability.
doc41	2	The study tested the effects of a work-related medical rehabilitation program, implemented in routine care, compared with common medical rehabilitation in patients with musculoskeletal disorders.
doc41	3	Data were assessed in 2014 and 2015 and were analyzed by an as-treated analysis.
doc41	4	By means of propensity-score-matching, participants of work-related medical rehabilitation (intervention group, IG) were compared with similar participants of common medical rehabilitation (control group, CG).

doc47	1	To determine, whether in case of abdominal emergencies, complete abdominal ultrasound scans offer advantages over a goal-directed strategy in regard to problem-solving and detection of relevant pathologies.
doc47	2	Retrospective analysis of consecutive emergency exams that were ordered by the ER in our gastroenterological sonography unit from 06/2012 to 06/2013.
doc47	3	All patients got an ultrasound of the complete abdomen.
doc47	4	We compared the findings of the complete abdomen study with the findings of a hypothetical focused sonography.
doc47	5	The scope of the focused sonography depended on the presenting problem.
doc47	6	An ultrasound finding was classified as relevant, if it triggered diagnostic or therapeutic consequences.
doc47	7	Sensitivity and negative predictive value of the goal-directed strategy were calculated with the full abdominal scan as reference. 629 patients (53 % female), with an average age of 59 years (18-97) had emergency sonographies.

doc49	1	Salivary gland carcinomas (SGCs) are rare tumors which represent a challenge for diagnosis and therapy due to their histological diversity and the different disease courses depending on the respective subtype.
doc49	2	Little is known about the composition of the tumor microenvironment in SGCs.
doc49	3	A more comprehensive understanding of the relevant molecular changes and immunological processes of the tumor and surrounding stroma could help to improve therapeutic efficiency, for example by adjuvant immunomodulation.
doc49	4	This manuscript highlights recent studies analyzing the composition of the tumor microenvironment in salivary gland carcinomas.
doc49	5	The tumor microenvironment displays a significant diversity in the composition of immune cells among different tumor entities.
doc49	6	In one third of the SGCs, an expression of cell surface molecule LAG3 on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes could be observed.
doc49	7	LAG3-similar to CTLA‑4 and PD-1-inhibits cellular proliferation, activation, and homeostasis of antitumor-effective T cells.

doc5	3	There is no cure for this genetic disease and evidence-based treatment is limited.
doc5	4	Until recently, there were no randomized controlled trials performed in PCD, but this year, data of the first placebo-controlled trial on pharmacotherapy in PCD were published.
doc5	5	This cornerstone in the management of PCD was decisive for reviewing currently used treatment strategies.
doc5	6	This article is a consensus of patient representatives and clinicians, which are highly experienced in care of PCD-patients and provides an overview of the management of PCD.
doc5	7	Treatments are mainly based on expert opinions, personal experiences, or are deduced from other lung diseases, notably cystic fibrosis (CF), COPD or bronchiectasis.
doc5	8	Most strategies focus on routine airway clearance and treatment of recurrent respiratory tract infections.

doc50	1	Since its first appearance in December 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread all over the world at a rapid pace causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
doc50	2	Originating from the Chinese province Hubei, more than 29.4 million people globally have now been confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus and more than 930,000 patients have died so far from COVID-19 (situation as of 15 September 2020).
doc50	3	The virus is mainly spread during close contact by small droplets and aerosols.
doc50	4	During the close contact in medical examinations, such as echocardiography, the risk of contracting the virus is increased.

doc51	1	Electrical accidents and particularly subsequent compartment syndromes are challenging injuries for clinical treatment.
doc51	2	Creatinine kinase (CK) and myoglobin are known lab parameters to detect a compartment syndrome.
doc51	3	We followed up patients with electrical injuries between the years 2006 and 2016 at our burn unit.
doc51	4	We aimed to analyse the role of myostatin as marker for compartment syndrome through serum measurements within 48 hours after injury.
doc51	5	We collected data from 24 patients hospitalised with high-voltage electrical injury.
doc51	6	All patients were male.
doc51	7	We measured myostatin in 14 of these patients.
doc51	8	While CK-MB (creatinine kinase muscle-brain type [MB]) showed no significant correlation to compartment syndrome, CK and myostatin gave highly significant increases.
doc51	9	Interestingly, myostatin was significantly increased in electrical injuries but not burn injuries, while CK did not show a significant difference.
doc51	10	Thus, besides CK, myostatin can serve as reliable early marker for compartment syndrome in electrical injuries.

doc59	1	Chest pain is a common symptom for which patients present to their primary care provider.
doc59	2	Patients with acute chest pain pose a diagnostic challenge for the general practitioner since a wide range of diagnoses are possible, ranging from life-threatening acute myocardial infarction and pulmonary artery embolism to the far more frequent and harmless muscular tension belonging to the group of chest wall syndromes, as well as gastrointestinal causes such as gastroesophageal reflux disease.
doc59	3	The clinical evaluation of patients with acute chest pain is based on a thorough clinical assessment by the physician, including a physical examination and medical history, irrespective of the location of the examination.
doc59	4	This is followed by further technical examinations, such as a 12-lead electrocardiogram, and targeted laboratory diagnostics with point-of-care tests, including troponin and D‑dimer tests.
doc59	5	Diagnostic pathways and score systems, such as the Marburg Heart Score, have been specially developed to enable patient assessment and provide orientation in the primary care setting.

doc64	1	Thermal ablation of saphenous vein varicosis has developed into a standard procedure for treatment of varicose veins.
doc64	2	The clinical success of the endovenous thermal procedure is comparable to high ligation and stripping operations and a significant difference between these groups could not be detected in long-term analyses.
doc64	3	The only difference is in the genesis of saphenofemoral recurrence detected by duplex ultrasound: neoangiogenesis occurs after high ligation and stripping operation and after endovenous ablation of the great saphenous vein a recurrence occurs predominantly via a residual anterior accessory saphenous vein (AASV).
doc64	4	Reduction of costs by an increase in endovenous procedures carried out in an outpatient setting in comparison to stripping operations, which are still frequently carried out in Germany (in comparison to other countries) as an inpatient procedure, have meanwhile been confirmed.
doc64	5	An endovenous crossectomy (i.e., high ligation) should be strived for.
doc64	6	Nonthermal endoluminal catheter procedures are predominantly reserved for treatment of the short saphenous vein.
doc7	1	Natriuretic peptide serum levels (NP) are the most robust predictors of heart failure (HF) diagnosis and prognosis.
doc7	2	Therefore, international HF guidelines give highest evidence and recommendation on their clinical usage, particular in patients with dyspnea.
doc7	3	Key message of this review is to inform about the concept of sequential NP measurements as quantifiable plasma biomarker to objectify sodium-water-dynamics and clinical therapy response during recompensation of HF patients.
doc7	4	Essentially, three clinical scenarios result of sequential NP measurements and might have a valuable role in HF risk stratification, prognosis and need of therapy optimization of in- and outpatient care.

doc70	7	Have modern forms of osteosynthesis become established?
doc70	8	What are the most important complications?
doc70	9	The members of the German Society for Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery and the German Knee Society were asked to participate in an online survey.
doc70	10	A total of 511 completed questionnaires were evaluated.
doc70	11	Most of the respondents are specialized in trauma surgery (51.5%), have many years of professional experience and work in trauma centers.

doc71	2	The existing evidence shows that the German rehabilitation model is not effective for all target groups.
doc71	3	In addition to intensified measures for patients with a high risk of failed return to work, a less intense rehabilitation form could be useful for patients with moderate disabilities.
doc71	4	Therefore, in this study the feasibility of a part-time medical rehabilitation (German abbreviation: BbR) was examined.
doc71	5	The BbR was designed as a closed group program with a therapy duration of 48 hours (2 appointments per week over 12 weeks).
doc71	6	Furthermore, different access paths to BbR as well as the effects were focused.
doc71	7	Twelve groups with 6 to 12 participants each were planned in 3 outpatient rehabilitation centers.
doc71	8	In addition to the regular application process, insured persons were recruited via the network of rehabilitation centers as well as the company service of the German Pension Insurance.
doc71	9	The BbR focused on employed patients who were not on sick-leave and had the need for rehabilitation due to back pain.
doc71	10	The evaluation was multi-perspective and multi-methodical.
doc71	11	All participants completed questionnaires at admission, while and at discharge of the BbR.
doc71	12	In addition, discussions in groups were conducted with representatives of the rehabilitation centers, the pension insurance and employers.
doc71	13	In total, 7 groups with 56 participants could be realized in 2 rehabilitation centers.
doc71	14	The typical BbR-participant was female, married, without children, 48 years old and working full for medium-sizes enterprise without shift work.
doc71	15	The majority had no or minor no time of sick-leave in the year prior to rehabilitation.
doc71	16	59% of them were recruited by the rehabilitation centers; only few persons were assigned by the pension insurance.
doc71	17	Two thirds would not have applied for a medical rehabilitation without the offer of BbR. Overall, the participants were very satisfied with the BbR.
doc71	18	However, the compatibility of the BbR with the job and everyday life was perceived as a challenge.
doc71	19	A pre-post comparison showed moderate to strong differences in self-rated health, pain, functional status and work ability.
doc71	20	The BbR seems to be a useful additional concept in the German rehabilitation system for patients with moderate disabilities.
doc71	21	Before dissemination, the identified challenges should be solved.
doc71	22	This applies in particular to the recruitment and compatibility of rehabilitation with work and everyday life.
doc72	1	Hypoglossal nerve stimulation for obstructive sleep apnea - Updated position paper of the German Society of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, Head and Neck Surgery.
doc72	2	Since the first statement of the German Society of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS) is meanwhile an established treatment option for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
doc72	3	There are three HNS systems available in Germany which differ in their technical details of the underlying comparable basic principle.
doc72	4	For the unilateral HNS with respiratory sensing, several comparative studies, high-volume register analysis and long-term reports exist.
doc72	5	The continuous HNS without respiratory sensing does not require a sleep endoscopy for indication.
doc72	6	For the bilateral continuous HNS as the single partially implantable device, a feasibility study exists.
doc72	7	For indication, the assessment of positive airway pressure failure by sleep medicine is crucial, and the decision for HNS should be made in discussion of other treatment options for at least moderate OSA.
doc72	8	The implantation center holds primarily responsibility among the interdisciplinary sleep team and is primary contact for the patient in problems.
doc72	9	This depicts why structural processes are required to secure outcome quality and minimize complications.
doc72	10	The aftercare of HNS patients can be provided interdisciplinary and by different medical institutions whereat minimal reporting standards to document outcome and usage are recommended.
doc76	1	Ruptures of the pectoralis major (PM) tendon are rare but have increased in recent years, especially during fitness exercising, such as bench pressing.
doc76	2	The pathomechanism is an eccentric load under pretension of the PM (falling onto the outstretched arm, injuries during ground combat, boxing and during downward movement when bench pressing).
doc76	3	The rupture sequence starts from superior to inferior at the insertion site with initial rupture of the most inferior muscle parts, followed by the sternal part and the clavicular part.
doc76	4	Most classifications are based on rupture location, extent and time of injury.
doc76	5	In addition to clinical presentation and sonography, magnetic resonance imaging is now established as the gold standard in diagnosing PM pathologies.
doc76	6	Surgical management is indicated for all lateral PM ruptures with relevant strength deficits.
doc76	7	Treatment in the acute interval (<3 weeks) is the primary goal; however, even in chronic cases or after failed conservative management a secondary operative approach enables notable clinical improvement.
doc76	8	Conservative therapy mostly affects patients who have muscular injuries close to the anatomic origin and smaller partial tears.
doc76	9	Surgical management aims for anatomic reconstruction of the PM unit with restoration of the original tension to enable optimal strength transmission.
doc76	10	Surgical refixation or reconstruction (with autograft/allograft) of acute and chronic PM ruptures shows excellent clinical results with high patient satisfaction.
doc76	11	Latissimus dorsi (LD) and teres major (TM) tendon ruptures are rare injuries but can lead to significant impairments in high-performance athletes.
doc76	12	In contrast to PM ruptures, LD and TM injuries are primarily treated conservatively with very satisfactory results.
doc77	1	We aimed to compare the currently used nodal staging system (pN) with the number of metastatic lymph node (LN) stations (sN) and the number of metastatic LNs (nN) on survival in patients with NSCLC.
doc77	2	Between 2010 and 2017, 1038 patients resected for NSCLC were analyzed.
doc77	3	We performed three-different stratifications of LN status assessment: pN-category (pN0, pN1 and pN2); sN-category (sN0, sN1; one station metastasis, sN2; two-three stations metastases, and sN3; ≥ 4 stations metastasis); nN-category (nN0, nN1; one-three LNs metastasis, nN2; four-six Lns metastasis, and nN3; ≥ 7 LNs metastasis).
doc77	4	Five-year survival rate was 70.1% for N0 in all classifications.
doc77	5	It was 54.3% for pN1, and 26.4% for pN2 (p < 0.0001).
doc77	6	Five-year survival rates for N1, N2, and N3 categories were 54.1%, 42.4% and 16.1% according to sN, and 51.4%, 36.1%, and 7.9% according to nN, respectively (p < 0.0001).
doc77	7	In multivariate analysis, sN and nN were independent risk factors such as pN (p < 0.0001).
doc77	8	Hazard ratios versus N0 for N1, N2, and N3 were more significant for sN and nN than pN (1.597, 2.176, and, 3.883 for sN, 1.645, 2.658, and, 4.118 for nN, and 1.576, 3.222 for pN, respectively).
doc77	9	When the subcategories of sN and nN were divided into pN1 and pN2 subgroups, the anatomic location of the LN involvement lost importance as tumor burden and tumor spreading increased.
doc77	10	The number of metastatic LN stations and the number of metastatic LNs are better prognostic factors than currently used nodal classification in NSCLC.
doc8	1	For the purpose of illustration, we briefly characterize a 36-year-old male who developed classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder after work-related exposure to digital presentation of physical and sexual violence against animals and human beings as a social media content moderator.
doc8	2	After having been incapacitated for work for a period of 10 months, the patient was referred for socio-medical assessment.
doc8	3	Based on his high resilience and motivation it was concluded that the patient will regenerate and will be available for professional reorientation to re-enter the labor market within 6 months.
doc8	4	Nonetheless, we ascertained a total suspension of work performance regarding his last insurable employment.
doc8	5	This secondary, digital exposition is not described in the formally valid ICD-10 classification, but in the current valid version of DSM-5 it is included into the Criteria A4.
doc8	6	Here, exposure via electronic instruments, television, movies or photographs is excluded, unless it is linked to work activity.
doc8	7	This exemplifies the potential risks for mental health due to digital impressions during work and related socio-medical and actuarial consequences.
doc82	1	Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a rare disease with a heterogeneous nomenclature.
doc82	2	Carcinomas of the intra- and extrahepatic biliary tract as well as gallbladder cancer are oftentimes combined in clinical research and treatment algorithms.
doc82	3	However, these different cancer types vary not only in their anatomical features, but also in the underlying molecular alterations.
doc82	4	Surgery remains the only chance of cure.
doc82	5	Adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine for 6 months should be recommended after curative intended surgery.
doc82	6	In the palliative first-line treatment of advanced BTC, the combination chemotherapy gemcitabine and cisplatin remains the only evidence-based standard.
doc82	7	For second-line treatment, the combination of 5-FU, folinic acid and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is a treatment option based on preliminary data from a randomized phase 3 study.
doc82	8	Potential targeted therapies showing efficacy in prospective clinical studies are, for example, IDH-, BRAF-/MEK- and FGFR-inhibitors as well as immunotherapy.
doc82	9	Therefore, in the era of personalized medicine, molecular testing should be offered to all patients with advanced disease and indication for systemic treatment.
doc83	1	COVID-19 disease is a systemic inflammatory viral reaction starting with the viral phase followed by the inflammatory phase.
doc83	2	The first phase is rather mild and asymptomatic with only a small subset of infected patients turning into the inflammatory phase with high mortality.
doc83	3	Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular risk factors pose a considerably higher risk to develop severe or lethal COVID-19 disease course.
doc83	4	COVID-19 affects not only the epithelial cells of the lung parenchyma via ACE2, but also endothelial cells across the whole body thus leading to generalized endothelial damage and inflammation, so-called endotheliitis.
doc83	5	The histological morphology of endotheliitis comprises the accumulation of lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages beneath the endothelial cells and within the perivascular spaces.
doc83	6	Endothelial cells play an important role in the regulation of vascular tone and the maintenance of vascular homeostasis.
doc83	7	Endotheliitis thus can shift the vascular equilibrium towards more pronounced vasoconstriction with subsequent organ ischemia, inflammation with associated tissue edema and a procoagulant state.
doc83	8	Patients with pre-existing endothelial dysfunction (male sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and established cardiovascular disease) are particularly vulnerable and have adverse outcomes in COVID-19.
doc83	9	This is a rationale for approaches to stabilize the endothelium.
doc83	10	Most of these findings have been established from autopsies since the outbreak of the pandemic.
doc84	1	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver diseases.
doc84	2	In Germany, the prevalence in the adult population is estimated at 24 % and the incidence is increasing.
doc84	3	Prognostically, the distinction between early and advanced stages of the disease is important.
doc84	4	In particular, the extent of scarring considered as liver fibrosis is of prognostic significance.
doc84	5	Patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis show increased mortality.
doc84	6	Liver fibrosis develops as a consequence of a persistent inflammation of the liver tissue over time.
doc84	7	Since inflammation and fibrosis are histological features, liver biopsy is considered the reference method in the diagnosis of NAFLD.
doc84	8	More recently, non-invasive diagnostic methods for staging (of fibrosis) and grading (activity) of the disease are being developed and validated.
doc84	9	The current review summarizes new developments in non-invasive liver diagnostics.
doc85	1	The rehabilitation of people after suffering a stroke is a long-term process, in which patients, their families and friends are reliant on social support and assistance.
doc85	2	Therefore, the individual promotion of available resources and autonomy of those affected represents an important task.
doc85	3	The College for Health in Bochum and the German Stroke Help Foundation have developed the volunteer-supported model "Trained stroke helpers-a partnership-based model for local care (GeSa)" that educates stroke helpers as experts for individual local support of stroke patients and their relatives.
doc85	4	The stroke helpers offer a patient-oriented care and individual assistance in the daily routine and therefore make a contribution to improvement of the health-related quality of life of those affected and their relatives.
doc85	5	A training curriculum was developed and successfully tested and evaluated in a course with 21 stroke helpers.
doc85	6	Up to summer 2020 a total of 480 stroke helpers have been trained at 16 locations in 37 courses.
doc85	7	The experiences with the project have so far been consistently positive, which was confirmed by two scientific studies.
doc85	8	The inclusion of cooperation partners for the coordination of the volunteers, which was already implemented in the model project, has been shown to be the most important success factor for the sustainability of the project.
doc85	9	This article presents the results of the pilot study and the standardized process on implementation of a regional stroke helper project and describes the experiences with the previous course of the project.
doc86	1	The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the efficiency of early versus delayed treatment of vertebral fractures by balloon kyphoplasty with regard to fracture age.
doc86	2	A total of 106 patients (37 male and 69 female) with 128 vertebral body fractures, an average age of 67.5 years (21 to 92) and a body mass index of 26.4 (16 to 40.4) were recorded.
doc86	3	All fractures were evaluated radiologically and clinically.
doc86	4	Pain intensity (visual analogue scale 0-10), analgesics consumption (WHO steps 1 to 3) and the relevant surgery data (operating time, cement consumption, complications) were recorded.
doc86	5	37 A 1.1, 43 A 1.2, 43 A 1.3, 4 A 3.1 and 1 A 2.3 classifications were collected.
doc86	6	Fracture age in days was less than 23 days in 75 patients; the mean time of surgery was 43 minutes.
doc86	7	Analgesics consumption was reduced from 1.8 ± 0.8 preoperatively to 1.0 ± 0.6 postoperatively.
doc86	8	A significant improvement was found in pain intensity, which fell significantly from 8.2 ± 0.9 preoperatively to 3.9 ± 0.8 postoperatively.
doc86	9	In relation to fracture age and pain intensity, a significantly higher pain reduction was achieved with timing of kyphoplasty between 0 and 23 days.
doc86	10	Here, pain intensity decreased to 2.5 ± 0.5 postoperatively, compared with 4.5 ± 0.4 for fractures treated later.
doc86	11	Fracture age had no influence on vertebral body alignment or improvement of the kyphotic angle.
doc86	12	In summary, it can be stated that balloon kyphoplasty is a sufficient method to treat vertebral body fractures, to improve the kyphotic angle and reduce pain significantly.
doc87	1	Regenerative therapies like cell-assisted lipotransfer or preclinical experimental studies use adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) as the main therapeutic agent.
doc87	2	But there are also factors depending on the clinical donor that influence the cell yield and regenerative potential of human ASCs and stromal vascular fraction (SVF).
doc87	3	Therefore, the aim of this review was to identify and evaluate these factors according to current literature.
doc87	4	For this purpose, a systematic literature review was performed with focus on factors affecting the regenerative potential of ASCs and SVF using the National Library of Medicine.
doc87	5	Currently, there is an abundance of studies regarding clinical donor factors influencing ASCs properties.
doc87	6	But there is some contradiction and need for further investigation.
doc87	7	Nevertheless, we identified several recurrent factors: age, sex, weight, diabetes, lipoedema, use of antidepressants, anti-hormonal therapy and chemotherapy.
doc87	8	We recommend characterisation of the ASC donor cohort in all publications, regardless of whether they are experimental studies or clinical trials.
doc87	9	By these means, donor factors that influence experimental or clinical findings can be made transparent and results are more comparable.
doc87	10	Moreover, this knowledge can be used for study design to form a homogenous donor cohort by precise clinical history and physical examination.
doc88	1	Despite tremendous improvement in molecular properties over the last century, intravascular injection of iodinated contrast material may still have systemic and hemodynamic consequences.
doc88	2	Patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency may be at risk for acute kidney injury, which may be associated with an increased risk of the need for dialysis and mortality in the long term.
doc88	3	Many questions as to the physiological pathways, optimal definition, and incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury remain open.
doc88	4	These uncertainties are reflected in the changing landscape of this field in terms of nomenclature, research, and clinical practice.
doc88	5	Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention of post-contrast acute kidney injury all recommend giving prophylaxis in the form of intravenous hydration to high-risk patients.
doc88	6	Solid evidence for this strategy is lacking.
doc88	7	This article gives an overview of the changing landscape of post-contrast acute kidney injury and prophylactic intravenous hydration, with the aim of supporting informed decision-making in clinical practice.
doc88	8	Recent data have caused a shift in guideline recommendations: 90 % of patients formerly considered high-risk for contrast-induced acute kidney injury no longer qualify for prophylaxis.
doc88	9	The remaining high-risk patients, with severe chronic kidney disease, represent a vulnerable population for whom intravenous hydration may provide some benefits but also carries risk.
doc88	10	Intravenous hydration may benefit 'new' high-risk patients.
doc88	11	However, it also confers risk.
doc88	12	A dual approach to screening patients will help avoid this risk in clinical practice.
doc88	13	· Intravenous hydration is the cornerstone for preventing contrast-induced acute kidney injury.
doc88	14	· Solid evidence is lacking; recent data caused a shift in guideline recommendations.
doc88	15	· Intravenous hydration may benefit 'new' high-risk patients with severe chronic kidney disease; however, it also confers risk.

doc89	1	Patients with previous endocarditis are at highest risk of infective endocarditis (266-fold compared to the general population) - preventive strategies are of particular importance in this patient subgroup.
doc89	2	Patients with community-acquired E. faecalis bacteremia should undergo transesophageal echocardiography - according to a recent study the prevalence of endocarditis may be ≥ 20 % in this setting.
doc89	3	Several smaller observational studies suggest an association between E. faecalis endocarditis and colorectal neoplasias - colonoscopy should therefore be offered to patients with newly diagnosed E. faecalis endocarditis (particularly in patients with unknown portal of entry).
doc89	4	The non-inferiority of partial oral endocarditis treatment has been demonstrated in a selected subgroup of patients characterized by a stable condition/course, small vegetations and the absence of perivalvular complications.
doc89	5	Uncritical and early oralisation of endocarditis treatment in patients not fulfilling these criteria may lead to adverse treatment outcomes.
doc89	6	Approximately one out three patients with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) will suffer from LVAD-related infections during the first year after implantation.

doc90	1	Prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment management in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are of great clinical interest.
doc90	2	DNA methylation is an epigenetic process involved in gene regulation and could be a source of potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers.
doc90	3	This study comprises literature research in PubMed and own studies.
doc90	4	Gene methylation, e.g. of PITX2, is a strong, human papillomavirus (HPV)-independent prognostic biomarker.
doc90	5	SHOX2 and SEPT9 methylation in circulating cell-free DNA within blood plasma correlates with tumor stage and prognosis.
doc90	6	Methylation of diverse immune checkpoints, e.g., PD‑1, PD-L1, and CTLA4, is also prognostic and correlates with gene expression.
doc90	7	DNA methylation is a source of efficient prognostic blood plasma- and tissue-based biomarkers.
doc90	8	However, prior to clinical implementation, studies must prove that biomarker-guided treatment selection can lead to better outcomes or reduced toxicity.
doc90	9	The applicability of DNA methylation as a predictive biomarker for targeted drug-based cancer therapy seems promising, although further validation is needed.
doc91	1	The medical care of pediatric cancer patients in the German health care system relies on special structures.
doc91	2	All children and adolescents with a diagnosis of cancer receive uniform treatment within clinical studies or registers and exclusively at centers which can ensure interdisciplinary care by a multiprofessional team.
doc91	3	Reimbursement of outpatient services is highly heterogeneous among the centers, and the expenses are often not adequately compensated.
doc91	4	A nation-wide survey was performed among all centers of the German Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, with a standardized questionnaire inquiring which reimbursement models are used to finance outpatient treatment and whether full coverage of the expenses is achieved.
doc91	5	Of 58 Pediatric Oncology Centers in Germany 18 (33%) participated in the survey, including 8 (44%) University Hospitals.
doc91	6	The use of available reimbursement tools was highly heterogeneous.
doc91	7	Reimbursement for outpatient service was based on a mean of 3,33±1,49 individual components.
doc91	8	Of the 18 responding centers, 17 indicated that the revenues do not fully cover the expenses.
doc91	9	Pediatric oncology centers in Germany can not achieve full coverage of expenses in the outpatient setting.
doc91	10	Nationally uniform cost-covering remuneration strategies are needed.
doc91	11	This article proposes three individual models for an adequate nationwide financial framework for the outpatient care of pediatric cancer patients.
doc92	1	The term metabolic surgery describes the surgical therapy of metabolic diseases, which not only aims at weight reduction but more importantly on improving hyperglycemia.

doc93	1	A retrospective analysis of clinical outcomes and complication rates of patients treated with the latest implant design of the so-called Endo-Exo-Femoral Prosthesis (EEFP) was performed.
doc93	2	The aim is to gain specific information on long-term complications of this treatment-method.
doc93	3	In January 2019, data of all transfemoral amputees who were treated with TOPS at an acute clinic in Schleswig-Holstein from 2010 to 2016 were retrospectively analysed.
doc93	4	This was done with special consideration of postoperative complications.
doc93	5	For this purpose, all examination findings from routine clinical follow-up examinations were used.
doc93	6	The complications were divided into stoma problems, orthopaedic-technical (OT) problems, fractures and explantations.
doc93	7	All EEFPs had the same implant design (3rd generation).
doc93	8	This implant is currently the only TOPS in Germany that is clinically used.
doc93	9	Descriptive statistics as well as ratio information about occurred complications were calculated.
doc93	10	A total of 68 implantations were performed during this period.
doc93	11	Average observation time was 6.32 years (±2.16 years).
doc93	12	The mean age of the patients was 51.84 years±12.12 years.
doc93	13	Cause of amputation was mainly trauma (82,35%).
doc93	14	Stoma-associated problems had the highest incidence (7%) among all observed patient-related complications and posed the greatest challenges during the rehabilitation process.
doc93	15	Looking only at surgical complications, 81% had no complications at all.
doc93	16	In total, 15% had technical problems, 6% had peri-prosthetic fractures, 7% had stoma problems and 3% had to be explanted due to infection.
doc93	17	The analysis of collected data shows that TOPS (here the 3rd generation EEFP) can be a successful alternative treatment method to shaft prostheses after transfemoral amputation.
doc93	18	The indication should only be given after the failure of a shaft-prosthesis and contraindications must be comprehensively excluded.
doc93	19	The greatest challenges in the rehabilitation process are the avoidance of stoma complications, infections and OT-problems.
doc93	20	The rehabilitation of amputees treated with TOPS therefore requires an interdisciplinary, specialized rehabilitation team and lifelong rehabilitative care.
doc94	1	Mucoviscidosis (cystic fibrosis [CF]) is the most common autosomal recessive inherited multisystem disease with fatal outcome.
doc94	2	It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which lead to a dysfunctional chloride channel and a defective CFTR protein.
doc94	3	As a consequence, retention of insufficiently hydrated mucus affects multiple essential organs, mainly the lungs and airways, pancreas, liver, biliary tract and intestines.
doc94	4	This leads to inflammation and infection, fibrosis and progressive tissue destruction.
doc94	5	Respiratory failure is the major cause of mortality; however, in the no more than 30 years since the molecular characterization of the basic CFTR defect causing CF, tremendous success has been made with respect to the long-term prognosis of people with CF.
doc94	6	This improvement in the prognosis was achieved by the cooperative spirit and networking of the very active and international CF research community and by establishing a multidisciplinary clinical CF team that implements the existing evidence in various aspects of standardized care together with the CF patient.
doc94	7	This narrative review article presents the evidence in selected aspects of CF treatment, with special consideration of the most recent development of highly effective CFTR modulator treatment.
doc94	8	This treatment will soon become available for more than 90% of the global CF patients and transform the pathophysiology as well as the course of disease towards a treatable chronic condition in internal medicine.
doc95	1	The yeast Malassezia pachydermatis is a commensal but also the most isolated pathogenic yeast in canine otitis externa.
doc95	2	Essential oils (EOs) exhibit antimicrobial activity and thus could be an alternative for treatment of otitis.
doc95	3	The aim of this study was to analyse the in vitro efficacy of EOs against M. pachydermatis isolates from canine ears.
doc95	4	Twenty-two EOs were tested for their in vitro activity against 15 M. pachydermatis isolates by agar disc diffusion.
doc95	5	In addition, diluted EOs were tested and volatile antifungal activity was analysed by vapour assay.
doc95	6	Most EOs showed in vitro efficacy against M. pachydermatis.
doc95	7	A different susceptibility pattern of tested isolates was found.
doc95	8	Overall, the most potential EO was lemon grass.
doc95	9	Also, cinnamon leaf, clove, manuka, Indian melissa, oregano, palmarosa, and winter savory oil exhibited a strong antifungal activity.
doc95	10	Volatile activity was proven by the inhibiting effect in vapour assay.
doc95	11	EOs show in vitro activity against M. pachydermatis.
doc95	12	This study gives scientific background for the use of EOs in veterinary medicine.
doc95	13	Diverse susceptibility patterns of different M. pachydermatis strains emphasise the helpfulness of an aromatogram as one lead for the best choice of an EO for therapy.
doc96	1	Be it as a nicotine replacement or a fashionable seduction for young people or casual smokers with or without nicotine additives - the popularity of e-cigarettes in Europe has increased during the past decade.
doc96	2	In addition to the potential of long-term pulmonary damage, which is still largely unknown to date, there is a risk of battery explosion with specific injury patterns.
doc96	3	Most users are unaware of the danger in their pockets.
doc96	4	Between February and July 2019, four patients were treated with burns from exploded e-cigarettes in the burn centre at Sana Hospital in Offenbach am Main (Germany).
doc96	5	This article describes the cause and extent of the injury and its treatment.
doc96	6	In all patients, the cause of the explosion was what is called "thermal runaway" (very rapid discharge of the battery).
doc96	7	The average age of the patients, who were exclusively male, was 37 (25-50) years.
doc96	8	The combustion depth ranged from grade I to deep grade IIb.
doc96	9	The burnt body surface averaged 3 %
doc96	10	(0.5-4.5 %) TBSA and affected the body regions that are typically in direct contact with the e-cigarette: thighs, genitals and hands.
doc96	11	Conservative treatment was successful in one case and surgical treatment in two cases (two alloplastic covers, one meshed split-skin transplant).
doc96	12	One patient discharged himself from hospital against medical advice after initial treatment.
doc96	13	The average time in hospital for the three remaining patients was 15.6 days (6-17).
doc96	14	Burns from an exploding e-cigarette represent a rare new entity.
doc96	15	The force of the explosion of the battery body leads to injury patterns that require treatment in specialised centres with the entire spectrum of burn care.
doc96	16	Mixed injuries with deep burns occur at the predilection sites due to thermal action, colliquative necrosis due to leaking electrolyte fluid and contamination by foreign bodies (metallic lithium, splinters of the destroyed housing) and require special initial measures.
doc96	17	The extinction of fire caused by e-cigarettes also requires special measures.
doc96	18	Proper handling of CE-certified devices is essential.
doc96	19	Manipulation of the device in the event of defective functions or defective batteries is highly dangerous and should be strictly prohibited.
doc96	20	General security requirements must be observed.
doc97	1	In cases of aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity (APROP), recurrences can occur after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (IVB), in spite of successful treatment of the acute stage.
doc97	2	Therefore, long-term examinations in extremely premature patients are needed.
doc97	3	We defined recurrences as a relapse of plus disease and leakage (with or without proliferation) at the vascularisation border, but also anterior and posterior to it.
doc97	4	RetCam wide-field colour images and fluorescein angiography were performed before the first IVB (0.312 mg bevacizumab in 0.025 ml per eye), before each further therapy, i.e. additional intravitreal injection, laser- or cryocoagulation or pars-plana vitrectomy, and at the end of the therapy.
doc97	5	We analysed the images of 18 eyes with APROP of 9 extreme premature patients treated between 08/2007 and 12/2017 (GA 21 - 27 weeks, BW 430 - 890 g).
doc97	6	Long-term therapeutic success was achieved in only 4 eyes/2 children (22%) with one single injection.
doc97	7	In 2 eyes/2 children (11%), a second and third injection was given within 2 weeks because of an insufficient therapeutic effect.
doc97	8	Up to 3 injections together with laser coagulation were needed in 12 eyes/6 children (67%), in order to achieve complete resolution of ROP activity.
doc97	9	In 6 eyes/2 children (33%), resolution of leakage at the original vascularisation border was achieved only with further laser coagulation.
doc97	10	In one single eye, retinal detachment occurred after unsuccessful retinal surgery.
doc97	11	Before IVB, fluorescein angiography disclosed leakage due to proliferation in most of the patients (12 eyes/6 children).
doc97	12	In recurrences after IVB, a posterior shift of the leakage site was found (14 eyes/4 children), whereas after laser photocoagulation proliferative changes were also detected anterior to the vascularisation border (5 eyes/3 children).
doc97	13	Treatment was indicated based on angiographic findings in 14 eyes/4 children where wide-field colour images did not show plus disease or proliferation.
doc97	14	Intravitreal injection of 0.312 mg bevacizumab has been shown to be an effective therapy for the acute stage of APROP.
doc97	15	Long-term success required consequent monitoring and treatment of APROP recurrences.
doc97	16	Fluorescein angiography was particularly useful to detect recurrences that were not evident in wide-field colour images.
doc98	1	Urology has always been closely linked to technological progress.
doc98	2	In the last few decades, we have witnessed increasing implementation of various technologies and innovations in subdisciplines of urology.
doc98	3	While conventional laparoscopy is increasingly being replaced by robot-assisted procedures and the introduction of new robotic systems from various manufactures will continue for years, the field of endourolgy is still not dominated by robotic systems.
doc98	4	However, new systems (e.g., autonomous, robot-controlled aquablation of the prostate) are becoming increasingly popular and numerous development projects will also probably change clinical care in coming years.
doc98	5	In addition, further advancements in the combination of robotics with intraoperative navigation through the integration of imaging and augmented-reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology can be expected.
doc98	6	This combination of navigation and robotic technology is already being used successfully in prostate biopsy.
doc99	1	The German equivalent of the USA CPT Code dates in his surgical parts back to 1996.
doc99	2	This implies that modern surgical procedures cannot be adequately coded.
doc99	3	This article discusses the codes that are frequently challenged by insurance companies and justifies their application with relevant judicial decisions.
