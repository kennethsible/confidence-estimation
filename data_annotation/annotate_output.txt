28-Year-Old → 28. alter → 28-jähriger  	Chef → Chef → Koch  	Found → Fond → aufgefunden
chef → Chef → Koch  	stairwell → Stirwell → Treppenhaus  	mall → Mühle → Einkaufzentrums  
1. says → sagte aus → sagte  	2. läuft → bergauf → ging  		**Explanation:**  	- "sagt" in HYP is an incorrect tense compared to "sagte aus" in REF for "says" in SRC.  	- "läuft" in HYP does not appropriately convey the context of improvement as "bergauf" in REF does for "going well" in SRC.
body → Gremium → Leichnam  	resident → Präsident → [No direct equivalent, implied in REF as Frank Galicia being from San Francisco]  
death → Tod → Mord
Louis Galicien → Louis Galicia → Louis Galicia  	Bahnhof → Sender → Sender  	Leiter → Koch → Koch
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters → Ein Sprecher von Sons & Daughters  	said → sagte  	they → er → sie  	were "shocked and devastated" → von seinem Tod "schockiert und am Boden zerstört sein"   	by his death → von seinem Tod  	  	er → sie → they  	entsetzt → am Boden zerstört → devastated  		**Explanation:**  	1. "er" in HYP is a mistranslation of "they"/"sie" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the meaning.  	2. "entsetzt" does not fully convey the meaning of "devastated"/"am Boden zerstört", as it means "horrified" rather than "devastated".
close knit → Nacktfamilie → Familie  	dearly → teuer → schmerzlich  		**Explanation:** "Nacktfamilie" in HYP is a mistranslation of "close knit" from SRC. "Teuer" doesn't accurately convey the sense of loss as "dearly" or "schmerzlich" does.
No translation errors detected.
Hotels → Hotels → Hostels  		**Explanation:** "Hotels" in HYP is a mistranslation of "hostels" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.
found → fand → fand  	dating → brachte → hatte eine Freundin  	Galicia → Galicien → Garcia  		**Explanation:**  	- "brachte" in HYP is a mistranslation of "dating"/"hatte eine Freundin" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the meaning.	- "Galicien" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Garcia" in REF, which is a more accurate translation of "Galicia" from SRC in this context.
think → denken → vorstellen  	hurt → treffen → schaden
spirit → Geist → Mensch
His way → Seine Verbindung → Seine Art  	dish → Mund → etwas zu kochen  	dinner → Essen → das Abendessen  	Galicien → Galicien → Galicia  		**Explanation:** "Seine Verbindung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "His way"/"Seine Art" from SRC/REF. "Mund" in HYP is clearly incorrect compared to "dish"/"etwas zu kochen" from SRC/REF, and "Essen" in HYP should be "dinner"/"das Abendessen" as per SRC/REF. Additionally, "Galicien" is a misspelling of "Galicia" in both HYP and REF translations.
wanted → ändern → wollte  	altercation → ändern → Auseinandersetzung  		**Explanation:** "ändern" in HYP is a mistranslation of both "wanted" and "altercation" from SRC, significantly changing the meaning and context.
mit dem ging → mit dem schwamm
diamond in the rough → Diamant in dem Grub → ungeschliffene Diamant  		**Explanation:** "Diamant in dem Grub" in the HYP is a mistranslation of "diamond in the rough"/"ungeschliffene Diamant" from both SRC and REF, significantly affecting the intended metaphor and meaning.
SFPD → SPD → SFPD  	nennen → anrufen → anrufen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "SPD" in HYP is a mistranslation of "SFPD" from SRC/REF, specifically incorrect in this context.	2. "nennen" in HYP incorrectly translates to "call" which should be "anrufen" as in the REF, resulting in a change in action meaning.

give a damn → verhehle → schnuppe
Cosmopolitan → Kosmopolitisch → Cosmopolitan
hair → Haar → Dutt  	relaxed → entspannten → lockerem  	Bub → Bub → Dutt  	Lebensmittel → Lebensmittel → Essen  	reports → Berichte → heißt  		**Explanation:** "Haar" should contextually be "Dutt" as per REF, with "relaxed" translating to "lockerem." "Bub" is incorrect and should also be "Dutt." "Lebensmittel" should be "Essen" according to REF. Finally, "Berichte" does not match the contextual meaning of "heißt" as in the magazine reporting context.
question → Frage → Frage  	livid → Leben → Weißglut  	star → Stern → Star  		**Explanation:**  	- The word "Leben" in HYP is a mistranslation of "livid"/"Weißglut" from SRC/REF, as it significantly changes the meaning.	- "Stern" in HYP is a possible synonym but does not fit contextually as "Star" is used in REF, mapping more directly to the notion of a "Hollywood star."
love → liebe → Liebe  	child's → das → ist kein  	single → einzige → alleinerziehende  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words in HYP adequately translate the SRC sentence into German, with no significant mistranslations compared to REF. Differences are minor variations, not altering the sentence meaning.
No translation errors detected.
experience → Erfahrungen → Erfahrungen  	horseback → Pferdeweg → Pferd  		**Explanation:** "Erfahrungen" in both HYP and REF correctly translates "experience." However:		- "Pferdeweg" in HYP is a mistranslation of "horseback" from SRC, as it incorrectly refers to a "horse path" instead of "on horseback" like "Pferd" in REF.
golfing → goldenen → Golfturniers  	ride → getrieben → Ausritt  		**Explanation:** "Goldenen" in the HYP is a mistranslation of "golfing"/"Golfturniers" from SRC/REF, and "getrieben" in the HYP does not accurately capture the meaning of "ride"/"Ausritt" from SRC/REF. These translations significantly change the intended meaning in context.
58-Jahre → 58-Jährigen → 58-year-old
No translation errors detected.
horse → Pferd → Pferde  	feeding → Fütterung → Futtertrögen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Pferd" is singular in HYP, while "Pferde" is plural in REF, reflecting the correct translation of "horses" in SRC.	- "Fütterung" is a mistranslation of "feeding", which, in context, should be translated as "Futtertrögen" in REF.
Kilometre → Kilometer → Kilometer  		(Note: 'Kilometer' in both HYP and REF is a correct translation of 'kilometre'. No translation errors were detected. The issue in the translation lies in sentence structure, not single-word mistranslations.)  		**Explanation:** There are no single-word translation errors in the provided hypothesis (HYP) sentence when compared to the source (SRC) and the reference (REF) translation.
No translation errors detected.
career → Fahrerlaufbahn → Reitkarriere
Germany's best golfer → das beste Golf → Deutschlands bester Golfer  	tournament wins → Tumultsgewinne → Turniersiege  
zu → gestoßen → schwang
first → erste → erste  		**Explanation:** The translation of "first time" in SRC was correctly rendered as "erste Mal" in both HYP and REF. 		Langer → Langer → Langer  		**Explanation:** The position of "Langer" affects sentence clarity, not mistranslation. However, the meaning remains unchanged.		No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Each significant word in SRC is adequately translated in HYP, with respect to REF, despite minor variance in structure.
He → Der Grund → er  	had been → war → war  	convinced → überzeugend → überzeugt
Sportbeihilfestiftung → Sporthilfe → Sporthilfe  	von → aus → aus  		**Explanation:** "Sportbeihilfestiftung" in HYP mistranslates "Sport Aid foundation" in SRC as compared to "Sporthilfe" in REF.   	"von" in HYP mistranslates "from" in SRC as compared to "aus" in REF.
sympathetic → befreundete → sympathischen
Federal Cross of Merit → Federal Kreuz des Verdienstes → Bundesverdienstkreuz  	Silver Laurel Leaf → Silber-Laurel → Silbernes Lorbeerblatt  
No translation errors detected.
person → Mann → Preisträger
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although the structure differs from the REF translation, the words accurately represent the relevant parts of the source text without any significant mistranslation for single word units.
means → bedeutet → bedeutet  	lot → viel → sehr viel  	said → sagte → sagt  	award → Preis → Auszeichnung  	because → weil → denn  	it's → er → sie  	social → sozialen → gesellschaftliches  		**Explanation:**  	1. "means" correctly translates to "bedeutet" in both HYP and REF, so no error here.	2. "lot" translates to "viel" in HYP and "sehr viel" in REF, which is a minor difference and not a significant error.	3. "said" is translated as "sagte" in HYP and "sagt" in REF, making it a minor tense variation without significant change in meaning.	4. "award" is translated as "Preis" in HYP and "Auszeichnung" in REF; however, "Preis" and "Auszeichnung" are commonly interchangeable in this context, so not a significant error.	5. "because" is translated as "weil" in HYP and "denn" in REF; both serve the explanation function and difference is minor.	6. "it's" translated to "er" in HYP and "sie" in REF, where "sie" fits the subject "Auszeichnung" in REF better.	7. "social" translated as "sozialen" (HYP) and "gesellschaftliches" (REF), both acceptable translations but minor nuance difference.		Therefore, after reviewing, most instances indicate slight variations without significant changes in meaning, and any seeming errors like "er/sie" are more about contextual alignments rather than clear mistranslations. Hence:  		**No translation errors detected.**
Langer → Zeit → Langer  	encouraging → gezeigt → fördert  	up-and-coming → gezeigt → Nachwuchs  		**Explanation:** The word "Langer" is mistranslated as "Zeit" in HYP, altering the meaning. "Encouraging" is mistranslated as "gezeigt," which implies "shown" and does not convey the act of support or promotion. "Up-and-coming" is mistranslated as "gezeigt," failing to capture the notion of emerging or developing talent, reflected in "Nachwuchs."
1. passed → bewilligt → gab  	2. prize money → Preisgelder → Preisgeld  
two-time → Zwei-Master → zweifache  	US master's champion → USA → US-Masterssieger  	for German Sport → Deutsche Sport → des deutschen Sports
- Spurhaltesportler → Spurhaltesportler (Not a single word but completely incorrect: translates to "lane keep athlete" instead of "athletes/Leichtathleten") → Leichtathleten  	- Hartweig → Hartweig (mistranslation due to spelling error: "Hartweig" instead of "Hartwig") → Hartwig  	- Zäuner → Zäuner (mistranslation: translates to "fencer" but with wrong word/incorrect form) → Fechter  	- Krüger → Krüger (mistranslation in context: should be "rower" but mistaken as a common surname in non-sport context) → Ruderer  	- blühender Richter → blühender Richter (bizarre mistranslation, "blühender Richter" means "blooming judge", not "bob-sleigh rider") → Bob-Fahrer  	- Schauspieler → Schauspieler (incorrect word based on context, "Schauspieler" means "actor" instead of "show-jumper") → Springreiter  	- möglicherweise → möglicherweise (incorrect translation: "möglicherweise" means "possibly" instead of "posthumously") → posthum  		**Note**: These mistranslations are identified as they change the meaning of the original sentence significantly in the context of the awarded individuals' categories or misrepresent the original names and facts.
legends → Sportlernen → Sportlegenden
official → offiziellen → offiziellen   	illustrious → wunderbare → illustre  	gathering → Zusammenkunft → Gesellschaft  	show-jumping → Show-up → Spring  	wandered → geflogen → wanderte  		**Explanation:**  	- "Zusammenkunft" in HYP is a mistranslation of "gathering"/"Gesellschaft" from SRC/REF, altering the contextual meaning.  	- "wunderbare" in HYP is a mistranslation of "illustrious"/"illustre" from SRC/REF, altering the description of the gathering.  	- "Show-up" in HYP is an incorrect translation of "show-jumping"/"Spring" from SRC/REF, as "Show-up" does not capture the correct context of the venue type.  	- "geflogen" suggests flying, which does not correspond to "wandered"/"wanderte" from SRC/REF, indicating a significant action discrepancy.
No translation errors detected.
Clinton's → Clinton → Clintons  	Trump's → Trumpf → Trumps
Clinton → Clinton → Clinton  	Trump → Trumpf → Trump  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Trump" from SRC and REF, significantly distorting the name.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence and aligns well with the REF translation. While there are differences in sentence structure, they do not result in a meaning shift or incorrect single-word translations in context.
Trumpf → Trump → Trump  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Trump" from SRC and REF, changing the proper noun's correct name representation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately reflects the meaning of the SRC sentence when compared to the REF sentence, with correct rendering of the key phrase "role of the state" as "die Rolle des Staates." Hence, no single-word translation errors are present.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump
wants → wird → wolle  	lead → führen → besteuern  		**Explanation:** "wants" in SRC is correctly translated as "wolle" in REF, but incorrectly as "wird" (will) in HYP. "lead" is mistranslated as "führen" in HYP whereas "besteuern" (tax) would be the correct translation that matches the intent of REF.
He → Er → Er selber  	things → die Dinge → anders  	says → sagt → behauptet  	Trump → Trumpf → Trump  		**Explanation:** "Er selber" in REF provides a nuanced emphasis "himself," whereas "Er" aligns more closely with SRC's "He". "Things" translated as "die Dinge" is less aligned with the context of the REF "anders". "Says" as "sagt" and "claims" as "behauptet" show a subtle difference, but it's significant contextually. "Trump" is mistranslated as "Trumpf" in HYP, indicating a clear error.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words in the HYP provide an accurate translation of the SRC and align well with the meaning conveyed in the REF. The differences are mostly stylistic and do not constitute significant mistranslations.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** There are no single-word translation errors in the HYP sentence. Though there are minor differences in wording between HYP and REF, none of them significantly alter the meaning or context when compared to the SRC.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both the HYP and REF translations convey the same meaning regarding the increase of taxes for the rich as mentioned in the SRC. The difference between "Das würde" and "Deshalb würden" is a minor discrepancy and does not constitute a meaningful translation error.
No translation errors detected.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump
Kandidat → Kandidat → Bewerberin  	sogar → sogar → gar  		**Explanation:** "Kandidat" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Bewerberin" from REF ("Candidate" can refer to both male and female in English, but "Bewerberin" is specifically female in German). Additionally, "sogar" in HYP does not match the sense of "gar" from REF in this context, which signifies even more emphasis.
Democrat → demokratische → Demokraten  	tea party → Tee-Partei → Teaparty  
Trump → Trumpf → Trump

Clinton → es → Clinton  	sagt → fordert → saying  	Land → Land → country  	die → der → the (before "sauberen Energien")  	sauberen → erneuerbarer → renewable  	Energien → Energien → energies  	Jobs → Arbeitsplätzen → jobs  		**Explanation:**  	- "es" is used incorrectly compared to "Clinton".  	- "sagt" mistranslates "saying" which relates more closely to "fordert".  	- "die" does not match "der" which is contextually necessary in REF.  	- "sauberen" changes the meaning from the correct "renewable".  	- "Jobs" is less precise than "Arbeitsplätzen" which captures the context better.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence provides a reasonable translation of the SRC sentence compared to the REF. The variations observed, such as synonyms and phrasal changes, do not constitute significant meaning errors.

No translation errors detected.
pittance → Almosen → Hungerlohn
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, even though there are small variations in wording compared to the REF translation. The word choices "anheben" and "erhöhen," as well as "sie" and "ihn," fit the context and do not significantly alter the meaning.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words used in the HYP translation are contextually and meaningfully correct compared to both the SRC and REF sentences, with no significant mistranslations present.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump
No translation errors detected.

No translation errors detected.
every one → jeder → jede  	has → hat → hat (this reflects a singular agent not a plural subject "everyone")  	baby → Kind → Baby  		**Explanation:**  	1. **"Every one" in SRC should match to "jede" in REF, not "jeder," which is a different gender specification in German.	2. **"Baby" was mistranslated as "Kind". While "Kind" means "child," it's contextually important here to maintain "Baby."
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Each of the words in the HYP: "Eine Frau hält ihren kleinen Sohn in den Armen" accurately translates the respective words from the SRC sentence: "One woman holds her little son in her arms." The potential discrepancy between "in den Armen" (HYP) and "in den Arm gelegt" (REF) falls under minor phrasing differences.
looks → schaut → guckt  	inquisitively → inquisitiv → neugierig  	around the room → um → in den Raum  	wide → weit → großen
stares → steht → starrt  	tabletop → Tisch → Tischplatte  
realises → weiß → merkt
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** "Das Kind" in HYP and "den Kleinen" in REF both translate to "the child" from SRC, with "Kind" and "Kleinen" being interchangeable in this context. The translation in HYP adequately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence.
Szene → Szenario → Szene  		**Explanation:** "Szenario" in HYP is a mistranslation of "scene"/"Szene" from SRC/REF, altering the specific term used in the context.
No translation errors detected.
1. Condrobs → Kondros → Condrobs  	2. Flüchtlinglerinnen → Frauen auf der Flucht → refugee women  		**Explanation:** "Kondros" is a mistake in the spelling of the organization name "Condrobs." "Flüchtlinglerinnen" is not a proper German translation for "refugee women"; the REF provides a correct phrasing as "Frauen auf der Flucht."
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "Flüchtlinge" in HYP and "Geflüchtete" in REF both translate "refugees" from SRC, and they are both contextually and semantically correct, showing only a variation in word choice without a significant change in meaning.
journey → Reise → alleingeflüchtete  
Condrobs → Kondrom → Condrobs  	Frauenhilfe → Hilfsorganisation → Frauenhilfe  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP "Vor kurzem wurde offiziell eröffnet." and REF "Unlängst wurde sie offiziell eröffnet." both convey the SRC "It recently had its official opening." effectively. The differences between "Vor kurzem" and "Unlängst," as well as the omission of "sie" in HYP, do not significantly affect the translation of the core meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** "Menschen" in HYP and "Personen" in REF both adequately translate "people" from SRC, showing a minor synonym variation. The rest of the words in HYP align closely with both SRC and REF in meaning.
No translation errors detected.
exception → Ausnahme → Ausnahme  	bodyguard → Schurken → Wachmann  		**Explanation:** "Schurken" (HYP) is a mistranslation of "bodyguard" from SRC, which is correctly translated as "Wachmann" in REF.
exaggerating → übertreibe → übertrieben  	dealt → behandelt → Erfahrungen gemacht  
war → Krieg → Kriegen  	hopes → Hoffnungen → Hoffnungsträger  
woman → Frauen → Frauen  	sneak away → schleichen → stehlen sich davon  		**Explanation:** "schleichen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "stehlen sich davon" from REF, significantly changing the meaning. There are no other translation errors detected as "Frauen" accurately translates "women" from SRC and "Frauen" in REF.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
**SRC phrase → HYP word → Correct REF phrase**  	on the run → unterwegs → auf der Flucht  		**Explanation:** "unterwegs" in HYP is a mistranslation of "on the run"/"auf der Flucht" from SRC/REF, implying a different situation or context.
Schlepper → Menschenhändler → traffickers  	handeln → Akt → Handlung  		**Explanation:**  	- "Menschenhändler" in HYP translates to "traffickers" but is synonymously referred to as "Schlepper" in REF, which is a common term specifically for human traffickers in this context.  	- "Akt" in HYP translates to "act" as in a singular act, whereas "Handlung" in REF implies a broader "action" or "deed," aligning better with the context.
woman → Frau → Frauen  	are → ist → sind  		**Explanation:** "Frau" in HYP is a mistranslation of "woman"/"Frauen" from SRC/REF, and "ist" is a mistranslation of "are"/"sind", altering the grammatical number and meaning significantly.
stops → ende → endet  	says → erzählen → erzählt  	Unrecht → irre → Unrecht  	sagen Sie → erzählen → erzählt  		**Explanation:**  	- "stops" is mistranslated as "aufhört" in HYP; it should be "endet" as indicated by REF.  	- "says" is mistranslated as "sagen Sie" in HYP; it should be "erzählt" as in REF.  	- "Unrecht" is a contextual mismatch in HYP; REF uses "irre," which fits better in this context.  	- Additionally, "sagen Sie" is an incorrect formation in context, making the sentence structure incorrect compared to "erzählt" in REF.
lone → alleinerziehende → alleinstehende
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation adequately captures the meaning and context of the SRC sentence compared to REF, with no clear single-word discrepancies that change the meaning substantially.
consent → Zustimmung → freiwillig  	conceived → konzeptiert → entstanden
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence effectively conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence in a similar way to the REF. There are no significant single-word mistranslations that change the context or meaning.
schämen → - → Scham  		**Explanation:** In the HYP, "schämen" is used as a verb, but this does not correctly capture the noun "shame"/"Scham" context from the REF in relation to "are too ashamed"/"weil die Scham zu groß ist". The mistranslation affects the sentence's meaning, presenting a grammatical and contextual error.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation conveys the same overall meaning as the REF and SRC sentences, with differences in vocabulary ("erhalten sollen" vs. "zu helfen wüssten" and "muss es mehr" vs. "brauche es mehr") not significantly affecting the translation quality or meaning.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation adequately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence with no significant single-word mistranslations compared to the REF translation. The minor differences in phrasing do not constitute errors in translation.

No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence adequately translates the meaning of the SRC sentence without introducing any significant changes in meaning or context compared to the REF sentence.
separate → gesonderte → getrennt  	accommodation → Unterkünfte → beherbergt  		**Explanation:** In the HYP, "gesonderte" and "Unterkünfte" do not correctly translate to the more contextually fitting "getrennt" and "beherbergt" in REF. These words significantly alter the intended meaning.
perpetual → ewig → fortwährender  		**Explanation:** "Ewig" in HYP is a mistranslation of "perpetual"/"fortwährender" from SRC/REF, changing the inferred temporal scope and meaning.
Washing facilities → Waschanlagen → Waschräume
No translation errors detected.
word → Wort → sich herumgesprochen  	got around → so weit gekommen → sich herumgesprochen  		**Explanation:**  	- "word" was translated as "Wort" in HYP, but the REF correctly uses the phrase "sich herumgesprochen" to convey the meaning of "word getting around."  	- "got around" was translated as "so weit gekommen" in HYP, which does not convey the same meaning as "sich herumgesprochen" in REF.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The main elements "easy", "open", "second", and "house" in SRC are correctly translated into German in both HYP ("leicht", "eröffnen", "zweites", "Haus") and REF ("leicht", "aufmachen", "zweites", "Haus"). Both translations accurately capture the meaning of the source sentence, with minor differences in expression but no significant mistranslation errors.
Junior doctors → junger Ärzte → Assistenzärzte  	industrial → industriellen → Arbeitskampf  
Representatives → Vertreter → Stellvertreter  	junior doctors → Ärzten in der Ausbildung → Assistenzärzte  	industrial action → Arbeitsklagen → Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Vertreter" in HYP translates "Representatives" but should be "Stellvertreter" as used in REF.	2. "Ärzten in der Ausbildung" in HYP is a loose translation of "junior doctors," where "Assistenzärzte" is more precise in REF.	3. "Arbeitsklagen" in HYP is an incorrect translation for "industrial action," with "Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen" being the correct term used in REF.
Industrial → industrielle → Arbeitskampf		**Explanation:** "Industrielle" in HYP is a mistranslation of "industrial"/"Arbeitskampf" from SRC/REF, as the context refers to industrial action, meaning labor strikes or similar activities, not just "industrial" in the general sense.
JDC → die → Der  	sagt → sagt → sagte  	haben → haben → hätten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Die" in HYP mistranslates "The" which should be "Der" in REF.  	2. "Sagt" in HYP mistranslates "says" which should be "sagte" in REF to match tense.  	3. "Haben" in HYP mistranslates "have" which is better translated as "hätten" in REF.
Junior → Assistenzärzte → Assistenzärzte  	Mediziner → Medizinstudenten → Medizinstudenten  	Vertragsvereinbarung → Vertrag → Vertrag  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Although there are differences in the wording between HYP and REF, both consist of translations that adequately convey the meaning of the SRC sentence. Translations like "stimmberechtigten Abgeordneten" for "members who voted" and "seiner Mitglieder" cover the context sufficiently, albeit through slightly different expressions.
remain → still → ruhig  	persistently → constantly → beharrlich  		**Explanation:** "Still" in the HYP is a mistranslation of "quiet"/"ruhig" from SRC/REF, and "constantly" is a mistranslation of "persistently"/"beharrlich", altering the meaning and context significantly.
JDC-Exekutive → JDC Vorstand → JDC Vorstand  	Ihre → Euren → Euren  	Anliegen → Sorgen → Sorgen  		**Explanation:**  	- "JDC-Exekutive" in HYP is a mistranslation of "JDC Vorstand" in REF. The term "Vorstand" refers to the board or management, while "Exekutive" often implies executive authority, which can be semantically different, especially in organizational contexts.	- "Ihre" in HYP is a formal pronoun usage not matching the informal "Euren" in the context of REF, altering the intended tone.	- "Anliegen" refers to "concerns" in a general sense, but "Sorgen" from REF implies more of a worry or issue, reflecting the original concern's emphasis differently.
exec → Exec → Vorstand  	Rollprogramm → Rollprogramm → laufendes Programm  	Industriemaßnahmen → Industriemaßnahmen → Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "exec" is a mistranslation of "Vorstand" in the context, where it should refer to the board or executives, not the abbreviation "Exec".	2. "Rollprogramm" is not appropriately translating "laufendes Programm", which indicates a continuous or ongoing program, rather than rolling.	3. "Industriemaßnahmen" does not capture the specific context of "Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen", which refers to industrial action or strikes, rather than general industrial measures.
dispute → Streit → Streitigkeiten  	junior → Ärzte in der Ausbildung → Assistenzärzte  	stoppages → Auslaufverbote → Gesamtausfälle  
BMA's junior doctor leader → junge Arztführer der BMA → Leiter der BMA Assistenzärzte  	following → um → nach
members → Ärzten → Mitgliedern  	poll → Umfrage → Abstimmung  	junior doctors → Ärzten → Assistenzärzte  		**Explanation:**  	- "Mitgliedern" from the REF is translated as "Ärzten" (doctors) in the HYP; the REF context clearly specifies "members" rather than "doctors," altering the meaning.	- "Abstimmung" in the REF refers to "poll," correctly reflecting the electoral or voting context, whereas "Umfrage" (survey) in the HYP does not.  	- "Assistenzärzte" in the REF refers to "junior doctors," capturing the correct hierarchical designation, whereas "Ärzten" in the HYP generally means "doctors," which may include various ranks.
Health Secretary → Gesundheitsminister → Gesundheitsminister  	medics → Arzneimitteln → Ärzte  		**Explanation:** "Arzneimitteln" in HYP is a mistranslation of "medics"/"Ärzte" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.

leaders → Staats- und Regierungschefs → Anführer  	shake hands → die Hände zu schütteln → sich die Hände zu geben  	formal → formelles → offizielles  		**Explanation:**  	- "Anführer" (REF) aligns more directly with "leaders" (SRC) compared to "Staats- und Regierungschefs" (HYP), which can be more specific to government heads.  	- "die Hände zu schütteln" (HYP) is a literal translation for "shake hands," but "sich die Hände zu geben" (REF) is more idiomatic and contextually accurate in German.  	- "Formelles" (HYP) translates as "formal," similar to "offizielles" (REF) translating as "official"; however, "offizielles" aligns better with the context in which official declarations or endings are often described.
Petersberg-Palästes → St. Petersburger Palastes → St. Petersburg palace  		**Explanation:** "Petersberg-Palästes" in HYP is a mistranslation of "St. Petersburg palace," as seen from both SRC and REF, significantly altering the location's name.

No translation errors detected.
Anschuldigungen → Vorwürfe → Anschuldigungen  	ernsthaftesten → gravierendsten → ernsthaftesten  	eigenen → - → eigene  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Vorwürfe" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Anschuldigungen" in SRC and REF, as accusations are more directly captured by "Anschuldigungen."    	2. "Gravierendsten" in HYP doesn't accurately reflect "ernsthaftesten" used in REF and can change the nuance of seriousness.  	3. "Erdogans eigene Familie" in REF specifically includes the word "eigene," indicating possession, while HYP has omitted the word "eigenen," offering a slight misalignment in emphasis.

No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The translation of the main elements in the sentence from SRC to both HYP and REF maintains consistent meanings, and any variations (such as "verdrängt wurde" in HYP and "enthoben wurde" in REF) do not significantly change the meaning in context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words in HYP effectively convey the meaning of the SRC when compared with REF. The presence of synonyms and small changes like "auch" and "ebenfalls" do not significantly change the meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The difference in number between "ein wirtschaftliches Motiv" in HYP and "wirtschaftliche Motive" in REF is minor and not a significant translation error, especially considering the context can allow for either singular or plural interpretation.

banking → banken → zählen  	rush → Saisonage → Ansturm

Vedemosti → Vedosti → Vedemosti		**Explanation:** "Vedosti" in HYP is a mistranslation due to a typographical error and should be "Vedemosti" as in SRC and REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation (HYP) closely aligns with both the source sentence (SRC) and the reference translation (REF). The inclusion of "auch" (also) in HYP is consistent with "also" in SRC, and does not contradict the REF, implying no significant translation error.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation matches the meaning and context of the SRC sentence sufficiently, with no significant single-word mistranslations when compared to the REF sentence.

"liegt" in the HYP is a mistranslation of "one"/"größte" from the SRC/REF, changing the intended focus.	2. "aufgespielt" in the HYP does not accurately capture the connotation of "casting"/"gab" from the SRC/REF, altering the nuance of the sentence.	3.

be → sein → bezeichnend  	initial → Anfangs → Erst  	told → gesagt → aussagten  	a → einer → der  		**Explanation:**  	- "be" is inaccurately translated as "sein" in HYP, which should be "bezeichnend" in the context.  	- "initial" is translated to "Anfangs" in HYP, while it should be "Erst" as in REF for contextually correct translation.  	- "told" is translated as "gesagt" in HYP, not matching "aussagten" from REF, which carries more accurate context.  	- "a" is translated as "einer" in HYP, whereas "der" would be correct, matching REF.

1. used → verwendet → verfügbar  	2. initialised → initiiert → initialisiert
RSB → RBS → RBS  	außerhalb → dezentrale → der  	ändern → wechseln → zu		**Explanation:** "RSB" in HYP is a mistranslation of "RBS" from SRC/REF.

Dummond → Drummond → Drummond
interviewed → angehört → interviewt
1. **told → sagte → teilte mit**  	2. **brands → Markenbank → Bank von Marken**  		**Explanation:**  	- "sagte" in HYP translates to "told" in English, but the REF uses "teilte mit," which means to inform or share with, being a closer fit in this context.	- "Markenbank" in HYP suggests becoming a "bank of brands," whereas the REF uses "Bank von Marken," explicitly matching the source's concept of a "bank of brands."

No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence adheres closely to the meaning of the SRC and REF, with no significant single-word translation errors affecting the overall meaning.

Dettori → Der Champagner von Dettori → Dettori  	a double → Doppelten → Double  	Newmarket → Newmarkt → Newmarket  	takes → Gewinner → bringt
Gewinner → Gewinner → Gewinn  		**Explanation:** "Gewinner" (winner/person) in HYP is a mistranslation of "Gewinn" (win/achievement) from SRC/REF, altering the context and meaning of the sentence.
brought → brachte → setzte  	landmark → Marke → Meilenstein  	track → Bahn → Rennstrecke  	Predilection → Vorauswahl → Predilection  		**Explanation:**  	- "brachte" in HYP should be "setzte" to correctly translate "brought up" in this specific context.  	- "Marke" in HYP is a mistranslation of "landmark," which should be "Meilenstein" in this context.	- "Bahn" in HYP should be "Rennstrecke" to correctly convey "track."	- "Vorauswahl" in HYP is incorrect for the proper noun "Predilection," which should not be translated.

No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words in HYP and REF have equivalent meanings and accurately convey the meaning of the SRC sentence. The order of "auch" and "hier" is different but does not constitute a translation error.
Newmarket → dem Newmarket → bei Newmarket  	angelandet → angelandet → gelandet  		**Explanation:**  	- "auf dem Newmarket" in HYP is incorrect compared to "bei Newmarket" in REF. The English preposition "at" is more accurately translated as "bei" in this context.  	- "angelandet" in HYP is a mistranslation of "gelandet" in REF. In this context, "gelandet" is more appropriate for describing arriving at a place.
mundane → tausendjährige → banaler
No translation errors detected.
Dettori could find himself in a rewarding position with a win for Predilection.  		### **Explanation:**  		- "Freuden" (joys) in HYP is a mistranslation of "cheers"/"Jubel" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning.  	- "Präsidentschaft" (presidency) in HYP is a mistranslation of "Predilection" from SRC/REF, altering the context.
jockeys → Schachfiguren → Jockeys  	jump → Spitzenrennen → Hindernisrennen  	champion → Wagschirm → Jockey  	retired → 20-jähriger → pensionierte  	20-time → Kämpfer → 20-malige  	record-breaking → Rekordlaufbahn → rekordbrechenden  		**Explanation:**  	- "Schachfiguren" means chess pieces, which is a mistranslation for "jockeys."	- "Spitzenrennen" means top races, which doesn't convey the "jump" aspect of "Hindernisrennen."	- "Wagschirm" seems to be a nonsensical translation where "champion" should remain as "Jockey."	- "20-jähriger" means 20-year-old, incorrect for "retired" (pensionierte).	- "Kämpfer" means fighter, not "20-time" champion (20-malige).	- "Rekordlaufbahn" means record career, but "record-breaking" should be "rekordbrechenden."
Piggott → Leser → Lester  	Gewinner → Siegers → Sieger  	Karrieregewinne → Karrieresiege → Karrieresiege  
Jacken → Jockey → Jockey  	vorgelegt → erreicht → erreicht  		**Explanation:**  	"Jacken" in HYP is a mistranslation of "jockeys"/"Jockey" from SRC/REF, altering the meaning significantly as it refers to jackets instead of someone who rides horses in races.  	"vorgelegt" (submitted/presented) in HYP is a mistranslation of "achieved"/"erreicht" from SRC/REF, which changes the context of the sentence considerably.

30 → 30 → fast  	Frankies → Frankies → Frankie  	größten → größten → bereits  		**Explanation:**  	- "30" in HYP is correct, but there is a slight difference in meaning due to "fast"/"almost" being lost in translation.  	- "Frankies" should be "Frankie" to match the REF context.  	- "größten" meaning "largest" or "greatest" in English is a mistranslation of "winners" from SRC and should be "bereits", which is closer to the meaning of "already".
character → Charakter → Persönlichkeit  	Jockey → Scherz → Jockey
Flying dismount → Markenzeichen → typischen Flying Dismount
flying finishes → Fliegen → Flying Finishes  	flying dismounts → Fliegen → Flying Dismounts  	poster boy → Platterjungen → Aushängeschild  		**Explanation:** "Fliegen" mistranslates both "flying finishes" and "flying dismounts," which should be "Flying Finishes" and "Flying Dismounts" respectively, preserving the original English expressions as evident in the REF.

rollercoaster → rollenfähiges Fahrzeug → nervenaufreibend
winners → Rassengewinner → Großturniergewinnen  	survived → dienten → überlebte  	served → dienten → erhielt  		**Explanation:**  	- "Rassengewinner" in HYP is a mistranslation of "winners" in SRC, where "Großturniergewinnen" in REF more accurately captures the meaning in context.	- "überlebten" in HYP incorrectly refers to "die Bestände," whereas the REF "überlebte" correctly refers to a singular subject.	- "dienten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "served," where "erhielt" in REF aligns accurately with the penalty context in SRC.
suspension → Aussetzung → Sperre  	strength → Charakter → Stärke  		**Explanation:** "Aussetzung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "suspension"/"Sperre" from SRC/REF, and "Charakter" in HYP is a mistranslation of "strength"/"Stärke" from SRC/REF, both significantly affecting the meaning.

No translation errors detected.
A statement → eine Erklärung → eine Stellungnahme  	had "decreed to relieve → habe "beschlossen, befreien → habe "die Entlassung angeordnet  	duties → Amt → Pflichten  	head → Chef → Vorsitzender  		**Explanation:**  	1. "A statement" is translated as "eine Erklärung" in HYP but as "eine Stellungnahme" in REF. "Stellungnahme" more accurately reflects the context of an official statement or comment.	2. The phrase "had 'decreed to relieve" is captured by "habe 'beschlossen, befreien" in HYP, while "habe 'die Entlassung angeordnet" is used in REF, which more accurately captures the authoritative action ("decreed" and "relieve").	3. "Duties" is translated as "Amt" in HYP, which translates more directly as "office" or "position", while "Pflichten" in REF translates accurately as "duties".	4. "Head" is translated as "Chef" in HYP, which can mean "boss" or "chef", but "Vorsitzender" in REF is a more suitable term for a formal position like "head" in the provided context.

No translation errors detected.
think → meines Erachtens → denke  	administration → Verwaltung → Regierung  		**Explanation:**  	- "Meines Erachtens" (HYP) is a mistranslation of "think"/"denke" (SRC/REF).	- "Verwaltung" (HYP) is a mistranslation of "administration"/"Regierung" (SRC/REF), where "Regierung" more accurately represents the concept of an "administration" in the context of government.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately captures the meaning conveyed in both the SRC and REF. The semantic content is consistently translated without introducing any significant errors that alter the meaning or context.
Lächeln → lächelnden Gesichter → Gesichter  		**Explanation:** "Lächeln" in HYP is a mistranslation of "smiles" which is better captured in context by "lächelnden Gesichter" in REF, focusing on the act of smiling on faces.
mystified → verleumdet → geheimnisumwoben
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately captures the meaning and context provided in the SRC and is closely aligned with the REF translation. The key terms and concepts such as "Sergei Ivanov," "Vladimir Putin," "soviet security service," and "KGB" are appropriately translated and there are no significant single-word errors altering the sentence's meaning.
chief of staff → Mitarbeiter → Stabschef
chief of staff → Personalführer → Stabschef
here → fehlen → hier  		**Explanation:** "Hier" in REF correctly translates "here" from SRC, whereas "fehlen" does not appear in any provided sentences, signifying a possible issue when directly compared word functionality, maintaining focus on context and structure. However, since this seems like a hypothetical mistranslation not represented in HYP, this output needs reconsideration based on actual direct translation errors present. 		Thus, **actual translation errors can be translated as no significant mistranslations detected** considering the context of hypoanalysis based on understanding of parsing. Let us correct the hypothetical misunderstanding as there could be a referencing glitch considered earlier.		No translation errors detected. 		(Note: reevaluation ensures actual translations align closely compared with REF and HYP context without presumed gaps).
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The translations "Ergebnis" in HYP and "Folge" in REF both adequately capture the meaning of "fall-out" from SRC, with no significant change in meaning.

No translation errors detected.
studiert → studiert → angepriesen  	plötzlich → plötzlich → auf einmal  	führen → führen → leiten  		**Explanation:** "studiert" in HYP is a mistranslation of "touted"/"angepriesen" from SRC/REF as it changes the intended meaning. "plötzlich" should ideally be "auf einmal" as in REF for better contextual accuracy, though "plötzlich" can still fit. "führen" does not fully capture the context of "run" where "leiten" aligns better with the REF for the environmental policy context.
1. remarks → Äußerungen → Bemerkungen  	2. Mr → Herrn → an  	3. troublesome → lästigen → beschwerlichen  	4. post → Posten → Posten (HYP and REF use the same word here; this is contextual error related to troublesome/ lästigen).		**Explanation:** "Äußerungen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "remarks"/"Bemerkungen" from SRC/REF. "Herrn" in HYP and "an" in REF differently handle the translation of "Mr," affecting the context slightly. "Lästigen" used for "troublesome" does not fit as well as "beschwerlichen" in context with "post"/"Posten," affecting overall translation quality.
chief of staff → Vorsitzender → Vorsitzender der Präsidialverwaltung  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation "Vorsitzender des Präsidiums" suggests a general chairmanship, while "Vorsitzender der Präsidialverwaltung" in REF specifically refers to the role of chief of staff. This is a significant contextual mismatch.

Putin → Herr Putin → Putin  	Premierminister → Ministerpräsident → Ministerpräsident  	Präsidentschaft → Präsidenten → Präsidenten  		**Explanation:**   	1. "Herr" in HYP is an incorrect addition as "Putin" is mentioned without a title in both SRC and REF.  	2. "Premierminister" is an incorrect translation of "prime minister," where "Ministerpräsident" is used in REF to match the context.  	3. "Präsidentschaft" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Präsident"/"president" in SRC/REF.
Minds → Star → Minds  	Producer → Produzenten → Produzenten  
altercation → Änderung → Auseinandersetzung  	show → Schauspiels → Serie
Television → TV → Television  	dismissal → Entlassung → Kündigung  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Television" in the source and reference is translated as "TV" in the hypothesis; while they are semantically similar, "Television" should have been retained for consistency.	2. "Dismissal" in the source is translated as "Entlassung" in the hypothesis, but the reference uses "Kündigung," which fits better with the context of ending employment or contractual participation.
Special Agent → Sondergesandte → Special Agent  	termination → Ankündigung → Kündigung  		**Explanation:** "Sondergesandte" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Special Agent"/"Special Agent" from SRC/REF, changing the role being referred to. "Ankündigung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "termination"/"Kündigung" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning regarding the announcement of the termination.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence translates "creative differences" and "disagreement" from SRC into "kreative Differenzen" and "Meinungsverschiedenheiten." The differences between "creative" and "künstlerischen" as well as "disagreement" and "Meinungsverschiedenheit" are minor synonym variations, and the overall meaning is preserved. Additionally, "set" in SRC is contextually implied in HYP, as is common in translations.
regret → bedauere → bereue  	occurred → passiert → Vorfall  	statement → Erklärung → Mitteilung  
Details → Wie → Einzelheiten  	show → Ausstrahlung → Serie  	written out → aufgeführt → herausgeschrieben
54-year-old → 54-Jährigen → 54-Jährige  	starred → verhungerten → spielte  	show → Schauplatz → Serie  		**Explanation:**  	- "54-Jährigen" in HYP incorrectly pluralizes "54-year-old"/"54-Jährige" from SRC/REF.	- "verhungerten" is a mistranslation of "starred"/"spielte", introducing a completely unrelated meaning ("starved").	- "Schauplatz" is contextually incorrect for "show"/"Serie", as it refers more to a "scene" or "setting" rather than a television show.

see → durchzusetzen → dabei zu sein

"Schriftstellern" in HYP is a mistranslation of "writers"/"Autoren" from SRC/REF, changing the specific context from the more usual term for TV/film writers.	2. "Herstellern" in HYP is a mistranslation of "producers"/"Produzenten" from SRC/REF, switching the meaning to a different context.	3. "Akteuren" in HYP is a less precise term for "actors"/"Schauspielern" in SRC/REF, often implying people of action rather than performers.	4. "Mannschaft" in HYP translates to "crew" in an incorrect context, where "Crew" is the more precise and commonly used term in REF.		These words specifically alter the recognized professions and terms used in the film and television industry.
return → Rückkehr → Staffel  		**Explanation:** "Rückkehr" in HYP is a mistranslation of "season"/"Staffel" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning of the translation significantly.

Banff man → Bankmann → Einwohner von Banff  	identifying → Feststellung → Identifizierung  	fish → Fisch → Fische
fish → Fische → Sandaale  	waterspout → Wasserspurt → Springbrunnen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Fische" in HYP is a mistranslation of "sand eels" from SRC/REF, as "Sandaale" is the correct specific term for "sand eels."	2. "Wasserspurt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "waterspout"/"Springbrunnen," as "Wasserspurt" does not represent the intended meaning of "waterspout" related to meteorological phenomena.
500m → 500 Millionen → 500 Meter  	footage → dargestellt → Video  	two-inch → Zwei-Zang → zwei Zoll langen  		**Explanation:**  	- "500 Millionen" in HYP incorrectly translates "500m" from SRC and "500 Meter" from REF.  	- "dargestellt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "footage" from SRC and "Video" in REF.  	- "Zwei-Zang" in HYP is an incorrect translation of "two-inch" from SRC and "zwei Zoll langen" from REF.

engineering → Maschinerie → Ingenieurskunst  		**Explanation:** "Maschinerie" in HYP is a mistranslation of "engineering"/"Ingenieurskunst" from SRC/REF, altering the meaning from the context of skilled craft to machinery.
**massive → enormen → massiven**  	**vehicle → Fahrzeug → Viadukt**  		**Explanation:**  	- "massive" from the SRC should be "massiven" in the REF, as it better captures the original word than "enormen" found in the HYP sentence.	- "viaduct" from the SRC is mistranslated as "Fahrzeug" (vehicle) in HYP, whereas it should correctly be "Viadukt" as in the REF translation, maintaining the structural context.
deck → Teppich → Deck  	abgeworfen → bekommt → gegossen  		**Explanation:** "Teppich" in HYP is a mistranslation of "deck"/"Deck" from SRC/REF, altering the meaning. "Abgeworfen" in HYP incorrectly translates the action related to the concrete, not capturing the meaning of "cast"/"gegossen"/"bekommt".
Forth → Foth → Forth  	Schließung → Verschluss → Verschluss  		**Explanation:** "Foth" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Forth" from SRC/REF, altering the name's correctness. "Schließung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Verschluss," which is a more appropriate term in this context.
Schließung → Verschluss → closure  	zivile → Hoch- und Tiefbau → civil engineering  		**Explanation:** "Schließung" is an incorrect translation of "closure" compared to "Verschluss" in REF. "Zivile" does not accurately capture the concept of "civil engineering" as provided by "Hoch- und Tiefbau" in REF.
1. deck → Abschnitt → Deck
approach → Ansatz → Zubringerbrücke
No translation errors detected.
viaduct → Produkt → Viadukt  	gradient → Grab → Steigung  		**Explanation:** "Produkt" is a mistranslation of "viaduct"/"Viadukt" from SRC/REF, and "Grab" is a mistranslation of "gradient"/"Steigung", significantly affecting the meaning of the sentence.
Tolerances → Toleranz → Toleranzen  	tiny → gering → winzig  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Toleranz" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Tolerances"/"Toleranzen" from SRC/REF, affecting the plurality and specifically referring to singular instead of plural.  	2. "gering" in HYP does not accurately reflect "tiny"/"winzig" from SRC/REF, altering the intended emphasis on how small the tolerances are.

Moelfre → Moelfare → Moelfre
thrown → vertrieben → geworfen
RNLI lifeboat station → RNLI-Rettungsboote → RNLI Rettungsstation  	raised → lösten → schlug  	alarm → Alarmglocke → Alarm  	incident → Vorfall → Ereignis  		**Explanation:**  	- "RNLI-Rettungsboote" is a mistranslation for "RNLI lifeboat station," which should be "RNLI Rettungsstation."	- "lösten" is a mistranslation in the context as it gives an incorrect sense of action; "schlug" fits better.	- "Alarmglocke" instead of "Alarm" changes the phrase meaning slightly but significantly in context.	- "Vorfall" and "Ereignis" demonstrate different levels of formality, but in this context, "Ereignis" is more appropriate to match the REF.
men → Männer → Männer  	struggled to swim → kämpften um → Schwierigkeiten sich in Sicherheit zu schwimmen  	boat → Schiff → Boot  	continued under → blieb → weiterbewegte  		**Explanation:**		1. "kämpften um" in HYP fails to convey the same meaning as "struggled to swim" and is notably different from the phrase "Schwierigkeiten sich in Sicherheit zu schwimmen" in REF, altering the context and dynamic of the action described.		2. "Schiff" in HYP translates to "ship" instead of "boat" which is "Boot" in REF. While "Schiff" and "Boot" can sometimes synonymously refer to vessels, here "Boot" is preferred for accuracy.		3. The phrase "blieb" meaning "remained" does not adequately translate the motion expressed by "continued under" in REF which is "weiterbewegte". The lack of motion in HYP leads to a different interpretation.
1. imagined → sich vorstellte → stellten uns  	2. Lebensboot → Moelfre Lebensboot → der Leiter der Rettungsstation von Moelfre  
starken Winde → Boot → Boot  	sie → das Boot → das Boot  	geräumt → geweht → geweht
man → wurde → wurde  	buoy → Jungen → Boje  	lifejacket → Rettungsjacke → Rettungsweste  
taken → kamen → None  	Lebensboot → Rettungsstation → Rettungsbootes  		**Explanation:** "Kamen" in the REF is used instead of "genommen" which HYP uses to translate "taken," albeit both refer to coming on board. The HYP word "Lebensboot" is incorrect as it translates to "lifeboat," whereas "Rettungsstation" is the intended term in this context within the REF. However, the actual correct word in the REF for lifeboat is "Rettungsbootes," referring to inshore lifeboat contextually within the REF.

engine → Rettungsschirm → Bootmotor  	kill cord → Rettungsschirm → Notstoppleine  	capsized → kam → Kentern  
Someone → Schurken → Männer  	watching over → geschaut → gewacht  		**Explanation:**  	- "Schurken" in HYP is a mistranslation of "guys"/"Männer" from SRC/REF, altering the original meaning.	- "geschaut" in HYP does not convey the same sense as "watching over"/"über gewacht" from SRC/REF, which implies care or guardianship rather than just looking or watching.
man → steht → sticht  	ex-girlfriend → Freund → Ex-Freundin  
ex-girlfriend → junge Freundin → Ex-Freundin
50-year-old → 50-jährige → 50-Jährige  	Key → Schlüssel → Schlüssel  	apartment → Abteilung → Wohnung  	belongings → Köpfe → Dinge  		**Explanation:**  	1. "50-jährige" in HYP is a mistranslation for "50-year-old" which should be "50-Jährige" to match the gender and capitalization.	2. "Schlüssel" matches correctly for "key," so there's no error here; mistake pointed out was incorrect.	3. "Abteilung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "apartment" from SRC, and should be "Wohnung" as in REF.	4. "Köpfe" (heads) in HYP incorrectly translates "belongings," which should be "Dinge" as in REF.
drunk → Betrunkenenangreifer → alkoholisierte  	attacker → Betrunkenenangreifer → Täter  	his → seine → ihrer  	ex-girlfriend's → seines ehemaligen Freundes → seiner Ex-Freundin  	clothes → Kleidung → Kleidung (no error here, same meaning)
came → bestand → kam  	stabbed → bestand → stach  	home → Hause → Wohnung  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Bestand" in HYP is a mistranslation of "came"/"kam" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning in context.  	2. "Bestand" is also incorrectly used for "stabbed"/"stach" from SRC/REF, altering the intended action.  	3. "Hause" translates to "home," but in REF, "Wohnung" was used, which fits the context better.
44-jährigen → 44-Jährige → 44-Jährige  	erlitten → wurde → wurde  		**Explanation:** "44-jährigen" (plural, masculine) in HYP is a mistranslation of "44-Jährige" (singular, feminine) in REF, which matches the gender and number in the SRC sentence. Additionally, "erlitten" in HYP was incorrectly used compared to "wurde," which fits grammatically and contextually here.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words in the HYP sentence adequately convey the meaning of the SRC sentence and align closely with the REF sentence. Differences in expression (e.g., "managed to" vs. "konnte" or "festzunehmen" vs. "festnehmen") do not present meaningful translation errors.
ex-girlfriend → ehemaligen Freund → Ex-Freundin
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Despite differences in phrasing, the meaning of each key component is preserved between SRC, HYP, and REF. The words for "called" (rief) and "sister" (Schwester) are appropriately translated, and "his" (seine/dessen) fits contextually. The auxiliary elements "then" (dann/daraufhin) and "a" (which appears due to different sentence structures) don't significantly alter the meaning or introduce errors in translation.

Niedriglohnhäuser → günstige Wohnungen
Wohnhäuser → Wohnen → Wohnen  		**Explanation:** "Wohnhäuser" in HYP is a mistranslation of "homes"/"Wohnen" from SRC/REF, which changes the specific focus of the plan from "living" to "houses".
smooth sailing → reibungslos → Streit
question → stellt → Frage  	low-cost → Niedriglohn → günstigen  	homes → Häuser → Wohnungen
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The key concepts in the SRC sentence - not reaching a settlement - are correctly conveyed in both HYP and REF, even though the phrasing differs.
designate → bezeichnen → ausweisen  	homes → Häuser → Wohnungen  		**Explanation:** "Bezeichnen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "ausweisen" in REF, which correctly implies an official designation. Similarly, "Häuser" in HYP is a mistranslation of "homes," deviating from the correct REF translation "Wohnungen," which is more contextually appropriate for social housing.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP and REF translations convey the intended meaning from the SRC sentence with acceptable variations. The differences do not signify clear mistranslations impacting the context or meaning.
Bratmann → [missing] → Bratmann  	Boden → Flächen → Flächen
spaces → Räumen → Flächen  	homes → Häuser → Wohnungen  	building → aufbauen → bauen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Räumen" in HYP mistranslates "spaces"/"Flächen" from SRC/REF.  	2. "Häuser" in HYP mistranslates "homes"/"Wohnungen", altering the meaning contextually.  	3. "aufbauen" in HYP mistranslates "building"/"bauen", changing the activity's context concerning housing.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words and structure in the HYP translation align well with both SRC and REF sentences. There are no significant single-word mistranslations that change the meaning. The terms used in HYP are appropriate translations of those in the SRC sentence, and differences between HYP and REF are minor variations or stylistic choices.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both the HYP and REF translations adequately convey the meaning of the source sentence, despite minor differences in phrasing. No single-word errors significantly alter the meaning.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation "Die Linke will, dass den Investoren strengere Anforderungen auferlegt werden" accurately reflects the meaning of the SRC sentence "The Left wants more stringent requirements to be imposed on investors." There are no clear errors when compared to the REF translation, which conveys the same meaning using different wording.
situation → Lage → Verschärfung  		**Explanation:** "Lage" in HYP is a mistranslation compared to "Verschärfung" in REF, which better captures the escalating situation implied in the SRC sentence.

No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:**  	- "Homes" in SRC is translated as "Haushalte" in HYP and "Wohnungen" in REF, both are contextually acceptable, representing different plausible variations of home.  	- "Even by 2020" in SRC is rendered as "auch bis 2020" in HYP and "allein bis zum Jahr 2020" in REF, both adequately capturing the timing aspect, though with slightly different nuances.  	- Overall, the key elements and meaning are captured correctly without significant discrepancies impacting the core message.

No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence and aligns with the REF translation.

No translation errors detected.
1. homes → Haushalte → Wohnungen  	2. affordable → bezahlbare → günstige  	3. housing → Wohngebäude → Wohnungen  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately captures the key elements of the SRC sentence, translating "owners, housing companies" to "ihre Eigentümer, die Wohnungsunternehmen," and expressing their opposition with "dagegen sind." The differences with the REF largely involve stylistic choices, without significant changes in meaning.
increase → erhöhen → erhöht  	affordable → erschwinglicher → Sozial  	blending → Verschnitts → Durchmischung  		**Explanation:**  	1. "erhöhen" (HYP) should be "erhöht" (REF) which is a more accurate contextual match for "increase".	2. "erschwinglicher" (HYP) is a mistranslation for "Sozial" (REF), as the context emphasizes affordable housing specifically.	3. "Verschnitts" (HYP) is a mistranslation for "Durchmischung" (REF), which contextually aligns with "blending" in terms of social integration or mixing.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The translation of the key concepts, although worded differently, conveys similar meaning in both HYP and REF regarding the distribution of disadvantaged people across districts or areas.
The → dabei → gibt  	manoeuvre → Spielraum → Bewegung  
chairman → Fraktionsvorsitzende → Fraktionsvorsitzender  	get into bed → anstrengen → mit ins Boot
However → jedoch → zwar  	detached → abgelegene → Einfamilienhäuser  		**Explanation:**  	- "jedoch" in HYP doesn't translate "However" as accurately as "zwar" in REF; "jedoch" is more akin to "nevertheless" or "though" which may nuance the meaning slightly differently.	- "abgelegene" is a mistranslation of "detached" in the context of homes. "abgelegene" means remote or isolated, while "Einfamilienhäuser" means single-family or detached homes.

No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The HYP translation uses different wording compared to REF, but both adequately convey the meaning of the SRC sentence. "dreht" (turns) in HYP and "verändert" (changes) in REF are contextually appropriate translations, with no significant change in meaning.
zeit → frei → Freizeit  		**Explanation:** The word "frei" in HYP ("sich lieber frei auf Bildschirme umsehen lassen") is a mistranslation of "their free time"/"Freizeit" from SRC/REF, which should reflect the concept of leisure time rather than freedom or being free.
couch → Regen → Sofa
Fernseher → Videospiele → Fernseher  	jüngere → zuletzt → zuletzt  		**Explanation:**  	- "Videospiele" in HYP incorrectly translates the initial restriction to "television" mentioned in SRC, whereas REF correctly uses "Fernseher."	- "jüngere" in HYP incorrectly translates "more recently" from SRC, altering the intended chronological context compared to "zuletzt" in REF.
great → großartig → toll  	being active → aktives Handeln → Aktivitäten  		**Explanation:** "Großartig" in HYP is a mistranslation of "great", which is better captured as "toll" in REF, and "aktives Handeln" does not accurately convey "being active", which is more correctly translated as "Aktivitäten" in REF.
of course → natürlich → selbstverständlich  	craze → Verrückten → Wahn  	app → Kapp → App  	characters → Charakteristika → Charakteren  	spawned → gegeben → entstanden  	spin offs → Spinnespiele → Spin-Offs  		**Explanation:**  	1.

No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately captures the meaning and context of the SRC sentence compared to the REF sentence.

Cardiogram → Cardiff → Cardiogram  	App → Papp → App
1. raw → rohe → Rohdaten  	2. exercise levels → Bewegungsstufen → Leistungssteigerung
1. verabschieden → sich zu verabschieden → vom Sofa zu kommen  	2. langweilig werden → langweilig → langweilig sind  		**Explanation:**  	- "sich zu verabschieden" in HYP is a mistranslation of "get off the couch"/"vom Sofa zu kommen" from SRC/REF, indicating a change in meaning.	- "langweilig werden" in HYP suggests that the messages "become boring," whereas the SRC and REF indicate that the messages "are boring."

exercise → tätig → Sport treibt  	reduce → verringern → reduziert  	chances → Chancen → Wahrscheinlichkeit  	getting → auf → an ... zu erkranken  	depression → Depression → Depressionen  
Gewichtsmanagement → Gewichtskontrolle → Gewichtskontrolle  	Blutdruck → hohem Blutdruck → hohem Blutdruck  	Leistungen → Vorteilen → Vorteilen  	aufgelistet werden können → zu lange ist, um sie hier anzuführen → zu lange ist, um sie hier anzuführen
But → jedoch → Aber  	outside → nicht → im Freien  	enjoy → genießen → Spaß macht
Pfeiler → Pfeiler → Säulen  	Sonne → Sonne → Sonnenschein  		**Explanation:** "Pfeiler" in HYP is a mistranslation of "pillars"/"Säulen" from SRC/REF, where "Säulen" fits the context better. "Sonne" in HYP is a mistranslation of "sunshine"/"Sonnenschein" from SRC/REF, as "Sonnenschein" is more accurate in the context.
Some → Einige → Manche  	on the hunt → bei der Jagd → auf der Jagd  		**Explanation:** "Einige" and "Manche" both translate to variations of "some," which could be considered minor; however, they reflect a consistent translation choice and difference. Moreover, "bei der Jagd" versus "auf der Jagd" presents a notable distinction in prepositional usage for "on the hunt" that could impact nuanced meaning or context.
po-faced → Demagogen → mürrische  	killjoys → Demagogen → Spielverderber
somebody → jemand → jemand  	walk into → gehen → gegen laufen  		**Explanation:**  	- "somebody" and "jemand" are aligned correctly, so that's checked off.  	- The phrase "walk into" is translated as "gegen laufen" in the reference, which is correct, whereas "gehen" in hypothesis does not convey the same meaning of accidentally hitting or colliding with something. The critical error stems from the verbiage suggesting a casual walk instead of an accidental encounter as "gegen laufen" does in the reference.

smarttpapiere → Smarttpapiere → Smartphone-Apps  	zu tun → zu tun → Sport zu treiben  		**Explanation:**  	- "Smarttpapiere" in HYP is a mistranslation of "smartphone apps"/"Smartphone-Apps" from SRC/REF.  	- "zu tun" in HYP is a mistranslation of "to exercise"/"Sport zu treiben" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning in the context of the sentence.
novelty → Neuheit → Neue  	wear off → ausbreiten → verlieren  		**Explanation:** "Neuheit" (novelty) in HYP corresponds to "Neue" (novelty) in REF, but "Neue" is a more contextually appropriate match given "seinen Reiz verlieren" (will lose its appeal). "Wear off" carrying the sense of losing appeal is incorrectly translated as "ausbreiten" (spread), which is incompatible with the intended meaning; the correct REF translation is "verlieren" (lose).
Pokmeon → Pokmeon → Pokemon  	Spielchen → Spielchen → Spiele  	Kappen → Kappen → Apps  	besser → besser → fitter  		**Explanation:**  	- "Pokmeon" in HYP is a misspelling and should be "Pokemon" as in the REF.	- "Spielchen" translates to "little games" or "gamelets," which inaccurately implies diminutiveness compared to "Spiele" in REF, meaning "games."	- "Kappen" in HYP is likely a mistranslation of "Apps" from SRC/REF.	- "besser" in HYP means "better," while "fitter" in REF accurately reflects the intended meaning.

Effortless → Unnachgiebigkeit → Mühelos  	beam → Bett → Balken

total → Gesamtbeschäftigung → Endergebnis  	journey → Weg → Reise  		**Explanation:**  	- "Gesamtbeschäftigung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "total"/"Endergebnis" in SRC/REF. It implies employment, which is incorrect in this context.	- "Weg" in HYP is a mistranslation of "journey"/"Reise" from SRC/REF, altering the meaning of the sentence.
achievement → Errungenschaft → Erfolg  	generation → Generation → einzigartige  	Phils → Phils → Phelps  		**Explanation:**  	- "Errungenschaft" can refer to an achievement but here "Erfolg" is contextually more appropriate in the REF.  	- "Generation" in HYP does not capture the connotation of "unique" in the REF ("einzigartige").  	- "Phils" is a typo, mistranslating Michael Phelps's surname, which is correctly spelled as "Phelps" in both SRC and REF.
Biles → Billen → Biles  	Gymnast → Spitzfindigkeit → Turnerin  	Rollon → Retton → Retton		**Explanation:**	1. **Biles → Billen → Biles**: "Billen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Biles," which is correctly translated in REF.	2. **Gymnast → Spitzfindigkeit → Turnerin**: "Spitzfindigkeit" in HYP translates incorrectly as it changes the meaning, while REF uses "Turnerin," meaning gymnast.	3. **Rollon → Retton → Retton**: "Rollon" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Retton," which is correctly translated in REF.
Biles → Biles → Biles (No translation error; just different phrasing.)  	Bereich → Bereich → Athleten  		**Explanation:** The word "Bereich" in HYP is a mistranslation of "field" which refers to "Athleten" in REF, indicating a focus on competing athletes rather than a general area or domain.
less → Frühjahr → nicht  	Spring → Frühjahr → Spring  		**Explanation:** "Frühjahr" in HYP is used as the translation for "Spring" from SRC, which is incorrect both contextually and in reference to proper name translation conventions in REF. Furthermore, the phrase "alles andere als" in HYP incorrectly translates "anything less than" from SRC, where "nicht" in REF correctly captures the intended meaning.
United States → Vereinigten Staaten von → Amerikanerinnen  	left → sich zurückgelassen → links  	embrace → akzeptieren → umarmen sich  	women's → Gymnastikerinnen → Frauen  	individual all-around → (missing in HYP) → Einzelmehrkampffinale

19-year-old's viral tweet → 19-jährige Virnetrot → 19-Jährigen sich schnell ausbreitende Tweet  		**Explanation:** The phrase "19-year-old's viral tweet" is mistranslated in HYP as "19-jährige Virnetrot". "Virnetrot" is not a correct translation for "viral tweet", which should be closer to "sich schnell ausbreitende Tweet" as in REF.
3 victims → 3 Opfer → 3 Opfer  	serial killer → schweren Todesfällen → Serienmörderfall  		**Explanation:** "schweren Todesfällen" (severe death cases) in HYP is a mistranslation of "serial killer" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.
das → das sprach → sich im Auto unterhielten und Musik hörten		**Explanation:**  	- "das" in the HYP is mistranslating the role of the subject in the sentence, creating a nonsensical structure.  	- The phrase "das sprach und Musik anhörte" in the HYP does not accurately represent the meaning of "talking and listening to music" from SRC, nor "sich im Auto unterhielten und Musik hörten" from REF.
car → Fahrt → Auto  	driveway → Fahrt → Einfahrt  		**Explanation:** In the HYP, "Fahrt" is used for both "car" and "driveway," which is incorrect. "Auto" and "Einfahrt" are the correct translations in context as per the REF sentence.
gunman → Schusswaffe → Täter  	handgun → Handfeuer → Handfeuerwaffe  	passenger → Passagier → Beifahrerseite  		**Explanation:** "Schusswaffe" (weapon) in HYP is a mistranslation of "gunman"/"Täter" from SRC/REF, "Handfeuer" in HYP is an incomplete translation of "handgun"/"Handfeuerwaffe" from SRC/REF, and "Passagier" in HYP mistranslates "passenger side"/"Beifahrerseite" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the context.
$ (Dollar sign) → Dollar → $ (Dollar sign)  		**Explanation:** The use of the word "Dollar" instead of the symbol "$" may suggest a translation inconsistency. Both REF and the original SRC mention "$2,900" directly, while HYP uses "Dollar", which can reduce clarity. Though not a significant meaning change, maintaining consistency with SRC and REF is crucial.
shooting → Schüsse → Schießerei
Hispanic → spanischen → hispanischen  		**Explanation:** "Spanischen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Hispanic"/"hispanischen" from SRC/REF, affecting the cultural and contextual meaning.
Howard → Herr → Howard  	KPHO → KHO → KHPO  		**Explanation:** "Herr" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Howard" from SRC/REF. "KHO" in HYP is a mistranslation of "KPHO" from SRC and "KHPO" in REF, which is presumably a typo in REF.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence adequately captures the main elements and context described in the SRC and matches the REF in terms of meaning, albeit with minor differences in phrasing. No single-word translation errors significantly altering the meaning have been identified.
evidence → Beweise → Beweise  	conclude → Abschluss → Schlußfolgerung  	attacks → Anschläge → Angriffe  		**Explanation:**  	- The word "Abschluss" in HYP mistranslates "conclude" from SRC, which is correctly translated as "Schlußfolgerung" in REF.	- "Anschläge" in the HYP sentence translates "attacks" from SRC but is inconsistent with "Angriffe" as used in REF.	- "Beweise" is correctly translated in both HYP and REF, so it is listed for clarity, as HYP uses a different structure that might make it less obvious.
hospitalized → gesteckt → hospitalisiert  		**Explanation:** "Gesteckt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "hospitalized"/"hospitalisiert" from SRC/REF, altering the meaning and context.
Liner → Linner → Liner  	died → starben → verstarben
parked → Parkauto → geparkten  		**Explanation:** In the HYP sentence, "Parkauto" is a mistranslation of "parked"/"geparkten" from SRC/REF, altering the context by incorrectly implying a specific type of vehicle rather than the act of parking.
pickup truck → Kinderwagen → Pickup-Truck  	shooting → Schuss → Schießerei  	killing → Töten → Mord  
bullet casings → Kugelsäcke → Patronenhülsen  	engine compartment → Motorenabschnitt → Motorraum  
6-year-old → sechs Jahren → 6-Jährigen  	microcephaly → Mikrokophalie → Mikrozephalie  
singen → Liebe → das Singen
Mom → Mom → Mutter  		**Explanation:** The word "Mom" in HYP should be "Mutter" to correctly translate the English word "mom" from the SRC sentence. Additionally, "seiner Schwangerschaft" should ideally be "ihrer Schwangerschaft" as "seiner" incorrectly refers to Edmund instead of Elizabeth in the context, but correcting "Mom" alone captures the main identified single-word error in the given task.
thought → kann → Gedanke  	can't do → tun → schaffe nicht
No translation errors detected.
I → habe → mich  	sign up → unterschrieben → eingelassen  		**Explanation:** "I" is translated as "habe" in HYP, but the REF captures its placement as "mich" in the structure of this particular expression. "Sign up" is mistranslated as "unterschrieben" (signed) in HYP instead of "eingelassen" (engaged/trapped oneself), which distorts the intended meaning.
not → nicht → nicht  	sign up → unterschreiben → eingelassen  		**Explanation:** "Unterschreiben" in HYP is a mistranslation of "sign up"/"eingelassen" from SRC/REF, as it alters the context and meaning of the sentence. "Nicht" adequately translates "not" from SRC and aligns with "nicht" in REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence compared to the REF, and no word in the HYP translation is distinctly incorrect. Minor structural differences do not change the semantic content or context.
No translation errors detected.
My → Meine → Meine  	didn't → dachte nicht → wusste nicht  	people → die Menschen → Leute  	anymore → mehr → noch immer  		**Explanation:**  	1. "didn't" in HYP should be translated as "wusste nicht" instead of "dachte nicht" to correctly match the REF.	2. "people" in HYP is translated as "die Menschen" which should be "Leute" to align with REF.	3. "anymore" in HYP is translated as "mehr" which should be "noch immer" to fit the REF translation contextually and accurately.
help → Hilfe → Hilfe  	walker → Walkers → Gehhilfe  		**Explanation:**  	1. In the HYP, "Walkers" is incorrectly translating "walker" from SRC. It should be "Gehhilfe" in REF.  	2. "der Hilfe" in HYP is not incorrect, but the structure "mit Hilfe" as in REF is more idiomatic in German, "Help" is correctly translated, recognizing the minor structural difference.
didn't sit → ist gewesen → konnte weder sitzen  	or crawl → ist gewesen → noch krabbeln  	doesn't talk → redet → sprechen  	zug → keine direkte Übersetzung im SRC und REF
meets → erfüllt → macht  	milestones → Meilensteine → Fortschritte  
He's walking with help, and riding a bike. → Er geht mit Hilfe, fährt mit einem Fahrrad.		**Errors:**		- walking → geht → laufen	- riding a bike → fährt mit einem Fahrrad → Fahrradfahren		Explanation:	1. "walking" is more accurately translated as "laufen" rather than "geht" in this context, to match "can walk" as in the REF sentence.	2. "riding a bike" should be translated as "Fahrradfahren" rather than "fährt mit einem Fahrrad" to align better with the context provided in the REF.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence effectively captures the overall meaning of the SRC sentence, with "spielt auch gerne" translating the sentiment of loving to play, and "seinen beiden Brüdern und singt" accurately translating "with his two brothers, and singing." The minor differences between HYP and REF do not denote mistranslations but rather alternative phrasings.
Edmund → aus → die  	made → aus → ausgedacht  	for → an → für  	"please" → "Bitte singen Sie an mich." → "Bitte sing mir etwas vor"
Picciuto → Picuto → Picciuto
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence compared to the REF translation, with no single-word mistranslations significantly altering the context or meaning. The words used in HYP are suitable translations of their respective counterparts in SRC and do not introduce errors when compared to REF.
Microcephaly → Mikrophale → Mikrozephalie  	measles → Masen → Masern  
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence aligns well with the meaning and context of both the SRC and REF sentences. Differences are minor and do not constitute significant single-word mistranslations.
Picciuto → Picuto → Picciuto  	Bilanz → Preis → Preis  	unsicheren → ungewissen → ungewissen
kept saying → habe immer gesagt → fragte ständig
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words and meaning between HYP and REF are consistent, with only minor synonym variations that do not affect the overall meaning.
actually → eigentlich → schon  	forever → ewig → seit langer Zeit  	for → um → nach  	prognosis → Prognose → der Prognose
mothers → Säuglinge → Mütter  	Picciuto → Picuto → Picciuto  	defects → Mängeln → Schäden  
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The translation in HYP effectively conveys the same meaning as the REF, with only a slight difference in structure that does not alter the conveyed message in German.
No translation errors detected.
Heavy → Starker → Heftige  	rain → Regen → Regenfälle  	flooding → Hochwasser → Überschwemmung  	prompts → sorgt für → gibt Anlass zu  	Missippi → Missippi → Mississippi  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Heavy" was mistranslated as "Starker" instead of the correct "Heftige".  	2. "Rain" should include the plural form "Regenfälle" to match the context provided by "heavy".  	3. "Flooding" should be translated as "Überschwemmung" for accuracy.  	4. "Prompts" was rendered as "sorgt für", a less accurate translation than "gibt Anlass zu".  	5. The typo "Missippi" in HYP should be corrected to "Mississippi".
Rain → Regen → Regenfälle  	state of emergency → Ausnahmezustand → Notstand  		**Explanation:**   	1. "Regen" in HYP mistranslates the contextually accurate "Regenfälle" in REF, changing the meaning slightly due to the emphasis on multiple rain incidents.  	2. "Ausnahmezustand" in HYP is a less precise translation of "Notstand" as in REF. The latter is a more common term in emergency declarations, which better fits the context.
1. overflowing → überfüllten → überfluteten  	2. southeast → Südost → Südosten  	3. southern → Süd → Süden  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Überfüllten" in HYP is an incorrect translation of "overflowing" as per the REF, which uses "überfluteten," a more accurate translation for the context.	2. "Südost" in HYP misrepresents "southeast" from SRC compared to "Südosten" in REF, a more contextually accurate translation.	3. "Süd" in HYP is a mistranslation of "southern" from SRC, whereas "Süden" in REF accurately conveys the meaning.
officials → Beamte → Behörden  	parishes → Parisaparitäten → Gemeinden  		**Explanation:** "Beamte" in HYP does not accurately translate "officials," whereas "Behörden" in REF does. Also, "Parisaparitäten" is a mistranslation of "parishes," for which "Gemeinden" in REF is the correct term.
spokesman → Sprecherin → Sprecher  	boats → Schiffen → Boote  	sandbags → Sandbags → Sandsäcke  
tens of thousands → Zehntausende → zehntausend  	sandbags → Sandbags → Sandsäcke  
flood → Hochwasserschau → Überschwemmungswarnsystem  	south → südlich → Süden  		**Explanation:** "Hochwasserschau" in HYP is a mistranslation of "flood watch"/"Überschwemmungswarnsystem" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning as a "flood watch" is a warning system, not a "show." Similarly, "südlich" in HYP mistranslates "south"/"Süden," inaccurately referring to directions rather than a specific region.
inches → Zentimeter → Zoll
flood watch → Flutwelle → Flutfrühwarnsystem  	Mobile area → mobilen Gebiet → Gebiet Mobile
Roge → Roge → Rouges  	Cremes → Cremes → Pegel  		**Explanation:**  	"Roge" in HYP is a mistranslation for "Rouges" in both SRC and REF, likely a spelling error.  	"Cremes" in HYP is a mistranslation for "crests"/"Pegel" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the intended meaning.
Krautmann → Herrn Krautmann → Alek Krautmann  	Rouge → Rote → Rouge  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Herrn Krautmann" in HYP does not match the full name "Alek Krautmann" found in the SRC and REF.	2. "Rote" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Rouge" from SRC and REF, altering the proper name context.
flooding → Hochwasser → Überschwemmung  	downstream → nachgelagerten → stromabwärts  	Ascension → Fall → Ascension  	swollen → Schwestflüsse → über die getretenen Flüsse  		**Explanation:**  	- "Hochwasser" is a less precise translation for "flooding" compared to "Überschwemmung" which captures the context of a flood better.  	- "nachgelagerten" does not accurately translate "downstream" as it suggests a sequence or order rather than a geographic direction, as "stromabwärts" does.  	- "Fall" appears to be an incorrect transcription or error for "Ascension," which should remain unchanged proper noun.  	- "Schwestflüsse" does not convey the meaning of "swollen," which is more contextually captured by "über die getretenen Flüsse" as used in the REF.
Tickfahw → Tickfahre → Tickfaw  	state line → Staatsstrecke → Staatsgrenze  	Mississippi → Missippi → Mississippi  	recorded → registriert → aufgezeichnet  	9 a.m. → 9.00 Uhr → 09.00  	Friday → am → Freitag  
plucking → geplündert → zupften		**Explanation:** "Geplündert" in HYP is a mistranslation of "plucking"/"zupften" from SRC/REF. "Geplündert" means "looted" which significantly changes the meaning and context.
stepson → Student → Stiefsohn
waters → Gewässer → Wasser  	Füße → Füße → Fuß  	von heute auf morgen → von heute auf morgen → über Nacht  		**Explanation:** 	- "Gewässer" in HYP is a mistranslation of "waters"/"Wasser" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning slightly since "Gewässer" suggests a more general or comprehensive body of water than "Wasser."	- "Füße" is a plural form in the HYP, while the REF uses "Fuß" (in singular). Though it may seem minor, this affects the precision of translation.	- "von heute auf morgen" in HYP does not capture the same immediacy as "über Nacht" from SRC/REF, altering the temporal element subtly.
said → sagte → sagte  	stepson → Mann → Stiefsohn  	alerted → lebt → gewarnt
water kept on coming → Wasser kommt weiter → Wasser strömte und strömte herein
came up to → kam von → erreichte  	waist → mir → Taille
creek → Reke → Flusses  		**Explanation:** "Reke" in HYP is a mistranslation of "creek"/"Flusses" from SRC/REF, changing the word and its context significantly.
No translation errors detected.
workers → Rettungskräfte → Nothelfer  	station → Feuerwerk → Feuerwache  	sheltering → untergebracht hatten → untergebracht waren  		**Explanation:**  	- "Rettungskräfte" in HYP mistranslates "workers," which should be translated as "Nothelfer" based on the context provided in REF.  	- "Feuerwerk" in HYP is a mistranslation of "fire station," which should be translated as "Feuerwache" as correctly done in REF.  	- "untergebracht hatten" in HYP does not accurately convey "sheltering," which is more correctly translated as "untergebracht waren" in the REF.
says → sagte → sagte  	flooding → Hochwasser → Überschwemmung  	are considering → erwägen → in Betracht zögen  		**Explanation:** "Says" in HYP as "sagt" is a mistranslation of "sagte" in REF, changing the tense. "Flooding" as "Hochwasser" does not match the contextual meaning as well as "Überschwemmung". "Are considering" as "erwägen" differs contextually from "in Betracht zögen" provided in REF.
13.75 inches → 13,75 Zinken → 13,75 Zoll
No translation errors detected.
Tangipahoa → Tangpahoa → Tangipahoa  		**Explanation:** The word "Tangpahoa" in HYP is a typo of "Tangipahoa" from SRC and REF, which may lead to confusion regarding the specific location referred to in the context.
alderwoman → Älterin → Beigeordnete  	flooded → überflutet hat → überschwemmte  
flooding → überschwemmen → überschwemmt
72 Menschen → 72 Leute → 72 Menschen  	mit → die → - (This word is incorrect contextually in HYP but does not map to a specific REF word and should be noted as incorrectly implying rescue with high water rather than from.)  		**Explanation:** In this example, the key mistranslation is the use of "mit" in the HYP, which incorrectly suggests the people and pets were rescued "with" high water, altering the intended meaning from SRC/REF where they were rescued "from" high water. Also, "72 Menschen" in HYP and "72 Leute" in REF don't fundamentally alter the meaning, but "die" in REF more accurately fits the context when referring back to the conditions caused by "Hochwasser".
Amite → Stadt → Städten  	Hammond → Stadt → Städten  	house → geöffnet → beherbergen  		**Explanation:** "Stadt" in HYP is incorrectly used for both "Amite" and "Hammond," as indicated by plural "Städten" in REF for both locations, and "geöffnet" is closer to "open" rather than "house" given the context of sheltering evacuated people.
Allowed → dürfen → können  	Starts → Anfängen → anfängt  		**Explanation:** "Dürfen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "allowed"/"können" which slightly changes the permission context. "Anfängen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "starts"/"anfängt", which changes the verbal aspect of the translation.
high → hohen → Hochwasser  	sandbags → Sandtaschen → Sandsäcke
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation (HYP) conveys the same meaning as the source (SRC) and aligns well with the reference translation (REF), with no significant single-word translation errors.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Although phrased differently, the HYP sentence does not introduce any significant single-word mistranslations when compared to the SRC and REF sentences. The meaning remains intact.
Mississippi → Missippi → Mississippi  	steady → stabile → regnete  		**Explanation:** "Missippi" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Mississippi" from SRC/REF due to a spelling error. "Stabile" in HYP is a mistranslation of "steady"/"regnete" from SRC/REF, altering the intended meaning of the rainfall description.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The differences between HYP and REF, such as "Er sagte" vs "Laut seinen Angaben," are stylistic and do not constitute significant translation errors of single words. Both adequately convey the meaning of the SRC sentence.
Foods → Food → Foods  	area → Gebiet → Gegend  		**Explanation:**  	- "Foods" in SRC corresponds to "Food" in HYP but should be "Foods" as in REF.	- "area" in SRC translates to "Gebiet" in HYP, but "Gegend" as in REF is a more accurate contextual match.
seen → habe gesehen → gesehen  	before → zuvor → zuvor  	down → zurück → (noch immer)		**Explanation:**  	- "habe gesehen" in HYP is a rearrangement error but technically correct based on the sentence structure; however, "seen" as "gesehen" in REF directly translates.  	- "noch nie gesehen" in HYP reflects the sequence different from SRC, affecting meaning, as "before" implies a sequence not continuity, as in REF with "zuvor".  	- "zurück" in HYP mistranslates the direction of 'down' from 'coming down', which should be contextually as in REF "noch immer".
Schüsse → Schießerei → Schießerei  		**Explanation:** "Schüsse" in HYP is a mistranslation of "shooting"/"Schießerei" from SRC/REF, as "Schüsse" refers to "shots" rather than the event of a "shooting".
6-year-old boy → Junge erschossen → Junge angeschossen
No translation errors detected.
Brown → Brown → Brown  	Schunenwunden → Schunenwunden → Schussverletzungen  	Getreide → Getreide → Lende  	Abdrücke → Abdrücke → Bauch  		**Explanation:** 		- "Schunenwunden" in HYP is a mistranslation of "gunshot wounds"/"Schussverletzungen" from SRC/REF.	- "Getreide" in HYP is a mistranslation of "groin"/"Lende" from SRC/REF, altering the meaning.	- "Abdrücke" in HYP is a mistranslation of "abdomen"/"Bauch" from SRC/REF.
took → nahm → durchgemacht  	Melenz → Melenz → Melendez  	Bahnhof → Bahnhof → Sender  
No translation errors detected.
(Verhältnissen → Zustand → Zustand)  	(Chirurgen → Operationen → Operationen)  		**Explanation:** "Verhältnissen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "condition"/"Zustand" from SRC/REF, and "Chirurgen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "surgeries"/"Operationen" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.
Family → Familie → Die Familie des Jungen  	tells → sagt → teilte dem Sender mit  	is expected → werde → voraussichtlich  	recover → erholen → genesen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Family" in SRC translates more specifically to "Die Familie des Jungen" in REF, indicating a specific family relationship.	2. "tells" translates to "sagt" in HYP, while the context given by REF shows "teile dem Sender mit" as a more accurate rendering, which includes contextually essential information ("to the station").	3. "is expected" is translated as "werde" in HYP, missing the nuance of "voraussichtlich" in REF which conveys "expectedly".	4. "recover"/"genesen" translates more directly than "erholen," which while similar, lacks the connotation of full recovery implied in REF.
first grade → ersten Stufe → erste Klasse
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.		- **Shot**: "erschossen wurden" in HYP suggests that the people were killed, which differs from "angeschossen wurden" in REF, indicating they were injured but not necessarily killed.		- **Germantown**: "deutschen Teil" in HYP is a mistranslation referring to a "German part" rather than the specific location "Germantown" mentioned in both SRC and REF.		### **Expected Output:**		erschossen → shot → angeschossen  	Teil → Germantown → Germantown  
shot → erschossen → angeschossen
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation (HYP) accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence into German, similar to the reference (REF). The differences are stylistic and do not involve meaningful changes in translation of critical words or phrases.
child → Kind → Junge  	shot → erschossen → angeschossen  	front → Vorsitz → Vordersitz  	condition → Verhältnissen → Zustand  
victims → Opfer → Opfer  	wounded → Verwundeten → verletzten  	shooter → Schuss → Täter  		**Explanation:**		- The translation of "wounded" as "Verwundeten" and "shooter" as "Schuss" in the HYP are incorrect compared to the SRC and REF. "Verwundeten" and "verletzten" both mean "wounded," but in this context, "Schuss" does not mean "shooter." The correct German translation is "Täter" for "shooter."
tells → berichten → teilten  	gunmen → Gunnen → Schützen  		**Explanation:**  	- "tells" in SRC should be translated to "teilten" in REF, but appears as "berichten" in HYP.  	- "gunmen" in SRC corresponds to "Schützen" in REF, while it is incorrectly translated as "Gunnen" in HYP.
Assault weapon-style → Angriffsgeschosse → Sturmgewehre  	scene → Szenarium → Tatort  		**Explanation:** "Angriffsgeschosse" in HYP misrepresents the term "assault weapon-style" as "Sturmgewehre" in REF, which is more precise. "Szenarium" in HYP mistranslates "scene," whereas "Tatort" in the REF correctly encapsulates the context of a crime scene.
No translation errors detected.
casings → Fälle → Hülsen  	sidewalk → Sidalwalks → Gehwegs  
1. Captain → Hauptmann → Polizeihautpmann  	2. station → Bahnhof → Sender  		**Explanation:** "Hauptmann" in HYP does not adequately reflect the context, while "Polizeihautpmann" in REF fits better. "Bahnhof" in HYP is a mistranslation of "station," which should be "Sender" as per REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence, and any differences with the REF are minor or stylistic, not leading to a significant change in meaning.
No translation errors detected.
stray → streunenden → Querschläger  	bullet → Dienstag → Querschläger  		**Explanation:** "Streunenden" in HYP is a mistranslation of "stray"/"Querschläger," and "Dienstag" (Tuesday) in HYP is a mistranslation of "bullet"/"Querschläger" from SRC/REF. These errors significantly change the meaning and context.
No translation errors detected.

No translation errors detected.
Olympischen Sommerspielen → Sommerolympiade → Sommerolympiade  	dominierend → dominant → dominant  		**Explanation:** "Olympischen Sommerspielen" in HYP is mistranslated as "Sommerolympiade" in REF, and "dominierend" in HYP should be "dominant" as per REF. Both changes affect the meaning to align with the correct reference translation.
features → umfasst → hat  	gymnasts → [missing] → Turnerinnen  	girls of color → Mädchen der Farbe → Mädchen anderer Hautfarbe  		**Explanation:**  	- "umfasst" in HYP is a mistranslation of "features" from the SRC and "hat" in REF.  	- "Turnerinnen" (gymnasts) is missing in HYP, which is crucial for the context.  	- "Mädchen der Farbe" (girls of color) in HYP is an incorrect translation and contextually insensitive in comparison to "Mädchen anderer Hautfarbe" in REF.
Aly → Aly Raisman → Aly Raisman  	Juden → Juden → Jüdin  	von Katholik → von Katholik → die Katholikin  	erfundene → erfundene → abrunden		**Explanation:**  	- "Juden" in HYP is incorrectly translating "Jewish"/"Jüdin", altering the meaning.  	- "von Katholik" lacks gender agreement and the correct term for "Catholic"/"die Katholikin".  	- "erfundene" translates as "invented", which does not fit the context of "rounded out"/"abrunden".  		Note: The name order in HYP and REF is a stylistic choice but doesn't count as a mistranslation.
team → Team → Mannschaft  	America → Amerika → USA  		**Explanation:** "Team" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Mannschaft" from REF, as it does not align with the preferred term used in the REF. Similarly, "Amerika" in HYP is a less precise translation of "USA" from REF, as "USA" is a more specific reference.
black → Frauen → schwarze  	Latina → Schwarzen → hispanische  		**Explanation:** The HYP uses "Frauen" and "Schwarzen" for the SRC terms "black" and "Latina," which are mistranslations compared to the REF's "schwarze" and "hispanische." These mistranslations alter the intended meaning and context significantly.
number → Zahl → Nummer  	gypsies → Zigeunerinnen → Turnerinnen  	African-American → Afrika-Amerikaner → Afro-Amerikanerin  		**Explanation:** "Zahl" in HYP mistranslates "number" which means "Nummer" in the context of ranking. "Zigeunerinnen" (gypsies) in HYP is a mistranslation of "female gymnast" which should translate to "Turnerinnen". "Afrika-Amerikaner" is a mistranslation of "African-American" when referring to a female, which should be "Afro-Amerikanerin" to match the gender context in REF.
No translation errors detected.
powerful → mächtig → Stärke  		**Explanation:** "Mächtig" in HYP is a mistranslation of "powerful"/"Stärke" from SRC/REF, which changes the intended meaning.
Olympic champion → olympischer Verfechter → Olympiagewinnerin  	gefeiert → gefeiert → jubelte
Douglas → Douglas → Douglas		**Explanation:** In this context, there are no significant single-word translation errors between the source, hypothesis, and reference. The comparison shows that potential differences are minor and do not change the meaning significantly, maintaining necessary consistency and accuracy relative to the context.
fourth → vierte → vierte  	straight → klare → heterosexuelle  	American → Amerikaner → Amerikanerin  	individual → individueller → individuellen  	all-around → Umkreis → Mehrkampfveranstaltung  		**Explanation:** 	- "fourth" is correctly translated as "vierte" in both HYP and REF.	- "straight" is translated as "klare" in HYP, which can mean "clear" but doesn't carry the intended nuanced meaning of "heterosexual" as used in REF. 	- "American" is translated as "Amerikaner" (male form) in HYP, while "Amerikanerin" (female form) is used in REF. This gender difference changes the context.	- "individual" is translated as "individueller" in HYP (an incorrect declension), whereas "individuellen" is the correct form agreeing with the noun in the REF.	- "all-around" is translated as "Umkreis" in HYP, which means "circumference" or "surroundings," instead of "Mehrkampfveranstaltung," which is an accurate context-specific term used in REF.
teammate → Teamat → Mannschaftmitglied  	earned → verdient → gewann  		**Explanation:** "Teamat" in HYP is a mistranslation of "teammate"/"Mannschaftmitglied" from SRC/REF, and "verdient" in HYP is a mistranslation of "earned"/"gewann," both significantly changing the meaning and context.
witnessing → werden Zeugen → erleben  	top → Spitzenspitze → Spitze  	gymnastics → Sport → Turn  	classes → Sportklassen → Klassen
Aly → Madrid → Aly  	make → machen → schaffen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Madrid" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Aly" from SRC/REF, which changes the name inaccurately.  	- "machen" in HYP is a less accurate translation in context compared to "schaffen" in REF for the phrase "to make the Olympic team."
1. Final Five → Final 5 → Letzten Fünf  	2. Spornalisten → Spornalisten → Turnerinnen  	3. Coaching → Coaching → Jahr / Trainerin  		**Explanation:**  	- "Final Five" translated as "Final 5" should be "Letzten Fünf" for clarity and context in the given REF translation.  	- "Spornalisten" is a mistranslation for "gymnasts", which is correctly translated as "Turnerinnen" in the REF sentence.  	- "Coaching" does not adequately reflect "year" or "Trainerin" from the REF, impacting the overall meaning.
1. Sportler → Turner → Turner  	2. fahren → trainieren → trainieren  	3. gehalten → aufrechterhalten → aufrechterhalten  	4. Fazilität → Einrichtungs- → Einrichtungs-  	5. Reisebusse → die Trainer → die Trainer  	6. Pornographie → Turner → Turner  		**Explanation:**  	- "Sportler" (HYP) is a mistranslation for "gymnasts"/"Turner" (SRC/REF). "Sportler" is a more generic term for "athletes".	- "fahren" (HYP) incorrectly translates "train"/"trainieren" (SRC/REF) in this context.	- "gehalten" (HYP) does not accurately capture "maintained"/"aufrechterhalten" (SRC/REF).	- "Fazilität" (HYP) is an inappropriate translation for "facility"/"Einrichtungs-" (SRC/REF).	- "Reisebusse" (HYP) is a mistranslation for "coaches"/"die Trainer" (SRC/REF).	- "Pornographie" (HYP) is a severe mistranslation for "gymnasts"/"Turner" (SRC/REF). This changes the meaning significantly and contextually.
Most → Die meisten → Die Mehrheit  	gymnastics → Spornastikvereine → Turnvereine  	business → Unternehmen → Geschäft  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Die meisten" in HYP does not match the exact meaning of "Die Mehrheit" in REF for the word "Most" in SRC.	2. "Spornastikvereine" in HYP is a mistranslation of "gymnastics" as "Turnvereine" in REF conveys the correct meaning.	3. "Unternehmen" in HYP is not contextually as fitting as "Geschäft" in REF for the word "business" in SRC.
gymnasts → Zigeunerinnen → Turner
Boorman → Boorman → Boorman  	coach → Bus → Trainerin  	Hernandez → Hernández → Hernandez  	coached → besucht → trainiert  	gymnastics → Spitzfindigkeiten → Turnen
more → erschwinglichere → leistbareres  	training → Gymnastikausbildung → Turntraining  	communities → Gemeinschaften → Gemeinden  		**Explanation:**  	- "erschwinglichere" is a mistranslation for "more" from SRC which accurately maps to "leistbareres" in REF.	- "Gymnastikausbildung" is a mistranslation for "training" from SRC which better matches "Turntraining" in REF.	- "Gemeinschaften" is a mistranslation for "communities" from SRC which aligns with "Gemeinden" in REF.
founded → Gymnasik → Turnstiftung  		**Explanation:** "Gymnasik" in HYP is a mistranslation of "foundation"/"Turnstiftung" from SRC/REF, which changes the meaning significantly. Additionally, the position of the words slightly alters context but is not prioritized as a single-word mistranslation.
15,000 → 15 000 → 15.000  	organisations → Organisationen → Veranstaltungen  	gymnastics → Gymnastiker → Turnen  	Urbane → städtische → urbane  	spanische → spanische → hispanische  		**Explanation:**  	- The number formatting "15,000" from REF appears as "15.000" in REF, which aligns with typical German formatting.  	- "Organisations" is mistakenly translated as "Organisationen" instead of "Veranstaltungen" in REF, leading to a change in meaning.  	- "Gymnastics" in SRC, meaning the activity, is inaccurately translated as "Gymnastiker" (gymnasts) in HYP, which does not match "Turnen" in REF.  	- "Urban youth" from SRC translates as "städtische Jugendliche" in HYP, which is a literal translation but does not match "urbane Jugendliche" from REF.  	- "Hispanic" in SRC is correctly translated as "hispanische" in REF, whereas HYP incorrectly used "spanische," which usually refers to Spanish nationality.
expand → ausdehnen → expandieren  	gymnastics → Gymnastiker → Turnen
Gymnastics → Gymnastik → Turnen  	determination → Entschlossenheit → Bestimmtheit  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words in the HYP sentence, while slightly different from the REF, accurately convey the meaning from the SRC sentence. Variations such as "bringt" vs. "bietet" and "gute Gesundheit" vs. "die Gesundheit" are minor discrepancies that don't significantly alter the meaning.
team → Teams → Mannschaft  	gymnastics → Gymnastik → Turnen
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** "Dies" in HYP and "Das" in REF both adequately translate "This" from the SRC. The difference is stylistic and does not constitute a significant translation error.

No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately translates the key components of the SRC sentence. Both HYP and REF contain similar translations that convey the meaning of the source without introducing mistranslations or errors. There are no single-word mistranslations that significantly alter the meaning.
promise → Jagd → Versprechens
imposition → Belastung → Aufzwingung  	junior → jungen → Assistenz		**Explanation:** "Belastung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "imposition"/"Aufzwingung" from SRC/REF, and "jungen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "junior"/"Assistenz" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the meaning and context.
junior doctors → Ärzte in der Ausbildung → Assistenzärzte  	industrial → industrielle → Arbeitskampf  		**Explanation:**  	- "Ärzte in der Ausbildung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "junior doctors"/"Assistenzärzte" from SRC/REF. While "Ärzte in der Ausbildung" could technically fit, "Assistenzärzte" is contextually and commonly used for "junior doctors" and is more precise in this context.	- "industrielle" in HYP is a mistranslation of "industrial"/"Arbeitskampf" from SRC/REF. "Arbeitskampf" is the correct contextual translation, indicating an action or measure related to labor strikes rather than meaning general 'industrial' activity.
strike → Streik → Streik  	end → Ende → Ende  	April → April → April  	nearly → fast → beinahe  	routine operations → Routineoperationen → Routineoperationen  	appointments → Ernennungen → Terminen  	nurses → Krankenschwestern → Krankenschwestern  	consultants → Berater → Fachärzte  	drafted → entworfen → einbezogen  	provide → versorgen → gewähren  	doctors → Ärzte → Ärzten  	picket line → Picketlinie → Streikpostenkette  		**Explanation:**  	- "Ernennungen" is an incorrect translation for "appointments"; it should be "Terminen".  	- "Berater" is an incorrect translation for "consultants"; it should be "Fachärzte".  	- "entworfen" is an incorrect translation for "drafted in"; it should be "einbezogen".  	- "versorgen" is an incorrect translation for "provide cover"; it should be "gewähren".  	- "Picketlinie" is a direct translation but contextually incorrect for "picket line"; it should be "Streikpostenkette".
conflict → Konflikt → Streit
BMA → BMA → BMA  	wants → will → möchte  	junior doctors → Ärzte in der Ausbildung → Assistenzärzte  		**Explanation:**  	1. "BMA" is correctly translated across both HYP and REF.  	2. "wants" is translated as "will" in HYP, whereas REF uses "möchte," which is more contextually aligned with "wants."  	3. "junior doctors" is translated as "Ärzte in der Ausbildung" in HYP instead of "Assistenzärzte" as in REF, which is the more direct translation.
chief executive → Chef → Generaldirektor  	junior doctors → jungen Ärzte → Assistenzärzte  	not to go ahead with any strikes → keine Streiks durchzuführen → den Streik zu beenden  
Industrial → Industriemaßnahmen → Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen  	achieves → bewirken → erreichen  	stretched → ausgedehnte → überbelastete  	distress → Sorgen → Not  	disruption → Störungen → Unterbrechung

NHS watchdog → NHS-Überwachungsbehörde → Regulierungsbehörde  	cardiovascular → Herz-Kreislauf → kardiovaskulärer  		**Explanation:** "NHS-Überwachungsbehörde" in HYP translates to "NHS watchdog," which is not a correct translation of "Regulierungsbehörde" from REF. Additionally, "Herz-Kreislauf" in HYP should correctly translate to "kardiovaskulärer" as per the source meaning of "cardiovascular."
Übergeben → Einnahme → Einnahme		**Explanation:** “Übergeben” in HYP (meaning “to hand over” or “to deliver”) is a mistranslation as it suggests a different action than what is intended. The correct context would be “Einnahme” in REF, meaning “intake,” which aligns with the context of administering a treatment or medication.
heart attack → Herzangriffen → Herzinfarkt  	stroke → angegriffen → Schlaganfall  		**Explanation:** "Herzangriffen" in HYP is a mistranslation for "heart attack"/"Herzinfarkt" from SRC/REF. Furthermore, "angegriffen" (meaning "attacked") in HYP is an incorrect translation for "stroke"/"Schlaganfall" from SRC/REF, changing the medical context significantly.
strokes → Herzstreiks → Schlaganfälle  	build-up → Anhäufung → Ansammlungen  	fatty → Fettsmaterial → fetthaltigen  	artery → Schachmauern → Arterienwänden  	plaque → Plaske → Beläge  
plaque → Plakette → Belag  	blood clot → Blutgerinnung → Blutgerinnsel  	heart → Herzschlag → Herzinfarkt  		**Explanation:** "Plakette" in HYP is a mistranslation of "plaque"/"Belag" from SRC/REF. "Blutgerinnung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "blood clot"/"Blutgerinnsel", and "Herzschlag" in HYP is a mistranslation of "heart attack"/"Herzinfarkt", all significantly changing the meaning and context.
clot → Uhr → Blutgerinnsel  	block → fließen lassen → verstopfen  	stroke → Schlag → Schlaganfall  
attack → Angriff → Herzinfarkt  	higher → mehr → höheren
Ticagrelor → Ticaglor → Ticagrelor  	AstraZeneca → Astrazeneca → AstraZeneca  	clots → Bekleidungen → Blutgerinnseln
draft → Teppichbehälter → Anleitungsentwurf  	600 mg → 60mg → 60mg  		**Explanation:** "Teppichbehälter" in HYP is a mistranslation of "draft"/"Anleitungsentwurf" from SRC/REF, changing meaning significantly. "600 mg" in HYP is a numerical mistranslation of "60mg" from SRC/REF.
NICE-Forschungszentrums → NICE Gesundheitstechnologieevaluierungszentrums → NICE Gesundheitstechnologieevaluierungszentrums  	Schlag → Schlaganfall → Schlaganfall  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Forschungszentrums" in HYP is a mistranslation for "Gesundheitstechnologieevaluierungszentrums" from REF, which refers to the specific nature of the center (health technology evaluation).	2. "Schlag" in HYP is a mistranslation for "Schlaganfall" from REF, which is the correct term for "stroke" in the given context.
Fear → Die Angst → Die Angst  	recurrence → Wiederholung → erneuten Herzinfarkt  		**Explanation:** "Wiederholung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "recurrence"/"erneuten Herzinfarkt" from SRC/REF. While "Fear" translates correctly as "Die Angst," HYP fails to capture the specific context of the recurrence.
evidence → Anzeiger → Ticagrelor  	strokes → -streiks → Schlaganfälle  
ticagrelor → Abkommen → Ticagrelor
Ticagrelor → Flugschreibers → Ticagrelor  	Blutungsrisiko → Überschwemmung → Blutungsrisiko  
PC culture → PC-Kultur → Kultur der Political Correctness  	vote → Betrug → Wahlbetrug
Ex-Tower Hamlets → der Bürgermeister der Ex-Tower Hamlets → ehemalige Bürgermeister von Tower Hamlets  	Lutfur → Lutfell → Lutfur  	removed → gestrichen → entfernt
blind → verschlossen → wissentlich  	widespread → Wahlbetrug → weitverbreiteter  		**Explanation:** "verschlossen" in HYP does not accurately capture the nuance of "blind" being turned (as in deliberately ignoring) as well as "wissentlich" does in REF. Additionally, "Wahlbetrug" itself is used for "widespread voting fraud", but the adjectival aspect "widespread"/"weitverbreiteter" is more accurately rendered in REF.
1. lambasts → plündert → greift verbal ... an  	2. town halls → Stadthallen → Rathäuser  		**Explanation:**  	- "Plündert" (HYP) means "plunders," which is a mistranslation of "lambasts." In this context, "greift verbal ... an" (REF) accurately conveys the meaning of "lambasts," involving a verbal attack.	- "Stadthallen" (HYP) translates to "city halls" or function halls, which does not fit the context. "Rathäuser" (REF) correctly translates to "town halls," keeping the intended contextual meaning.
former communities → Gemeinschaftssekretär → Minister für Integration und Kommunalregierung  	cordons → Abstriche → Absperrbänder  
ID → Ausweise → Ausweis

No translation errors detected.
council → Rat → Gemeinde  	papers → Papieren → Unterlagen  	decisions → Beschlüssen → Entscheidungen  		**Explanation:** "Rat" in HYP is a mistranslation of "council"/"Gemeinde" from SRC/REF. "Papieren" in HYP is a mistranslation of "papers"/"Unterlagen" from SRC/REF. "Beschlüssen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "decisions"/"Entscheidungen" from SRC/REF.

No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The key elements of the SRC sentence related to Rahman's actions (i.e., "cynically perverted" and "silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia") are adequately represented in both HYP and REF. The differences present are stylistic and do not change the core meaning or context.
1. ran → leitete → geführt  	2. faithful → treuen → (omitted in REF)  		**Explanation:** 	- "leitete" in HYP is a mistranslation of "ran"/"geführt" from SRC/REF, which changes the specific type of action involved in the campaign.	- "treuen" in HYP mistranslates "faithful", impacting the context by adding "faithful" which is not specified in the REF translation.
personation → Person → Nachahmung
evidence → Anzeichen → Beweise  
alarm → beunruhigt → alarmierend  	postal → Postbereich → Briefwahl  	senior → hohe → ältere  	people → Menschen → Leute  		**Explanation:**  	- "beunruhigt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "alarm"/"alarmierend" from SRC/REF, affecting the intended meaning.  	- "Postbereich" in HYP is a mistranslation for "postal voting"/"Briefwahl" from SRC/REF, altering the specific concept of postal voting.  	- "hohe" in HYP incorrectly translates "senior"/"ältere" from SRC/REF, changing the nuance of age or status.  	- "Menschen" in HYP is a less accurate translation of "people"/"Leute" from SRC/REF, though the difference in impact on meaning may be subtle. 
pictured → bilanziert → abgebildet  	clean up → Reinigung → säubern  	voting → Abstimmung → Wahl  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon comparing HYP and REF translations with SRC, there are no single-word errors within HYP that significantly change the meaning or context compared to REF. Both translations sufficiently convey the meaning of the original sentence, with minor syntactic differences that are not relevant to single-word errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon comparing the translations, both HYP and REF capture the core meaning of the original SRC sentence. Any differences are related to phrasing rather than substantial mistranslations of individual words.
recommendations → Empfehlungen → Empfehlungen  	clean up → Reinigung → säubern  	banning → Verbot → Verbot  	handling → Schluss → bearbeiten  	postal ballot papers → Stimmzetteln → Briefwahlunterlagen  	stop → Stopp → stoppen  	vote harvesting → "Wahlernten" → "Wahlernten"		**Explanation:**  	1. **clean up → Reinigung → säubern:** "Reinigung" in HYP is a noun form, while "säubern" in REF is a verb form, aligning better with the context of taking action on the system ("to clean up").	2. **handling → Schluss → bearbeiten:** "Schluss" in HYP is incorrect in context. The correct term should indicate the handling or processing of ballots, as correctly translated with "bearbeiten" in REF.	3. **postal ballot papers → Stimmzetteln → Briefwahlunterlagen:** "Stimmzetteln" in HYP is a generic term for "ballot papers," whereas "Briefwahlunterlagen" is more specific to "postal ballot papers" as in REF.		The other words ("recommendations," "banning," "stop," "vote harvesting") were correctly translated, or the differences were not impactful to the meaning.
May → Mai → May  	elektoral → Wählerverzeichnis → Wahlverzeichnis  	Einwanderung → Einwanderung → Immigration  	Sozialbetrug → Betrug → Sozialbetrug
producing → produzieren → fragen
indelible → unleugbare → nicht entfernbare  	voting → abstimmt → wählt  		**Explanation:** "Unleugbare" in HYP is a mistranslation of "indelible"/"nicht entfernbare," as "unleugbare" relates more to undeniable rather than the intended meaning of "indelible" (permanent). Additionally, "abstimmt" translates more closely to "voting," whereas "wählt" is more contextually correct as it denotes the act of casting a vote.
No translation errors detected.
requests → Anträge → Anträge auf eine automatische Briefwahl  		**Explanation:** The error here involves the context; "Anträge" in HYP is not directly wrong, but it lacks the specific reference to the type of requests mentioned in SRC and REF, which is "Anträge auf eine automatische Briefwahl". However, since this is primarily a semantic/contextual distinction, no single-word error is significantly altering meaning. Thus, focusing on it would be beyond the scope of single-word translation errors. 	So, technically:  		No single-word translation errors detected.
political → politische Aktivisten → politische Kampagnenarbeiter  	completed → mit den Abstimmungen → vollständige  	postal votes → Post → Briefwahlen  	postal vote envelopes → Postgeldern → Umschläge von Briefwahlen
police powers → Macht → Befugnis  	set up → korrigieren → einrichten  	cordons → korrigieren → Absperrungen  
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** Both HYP and REF convey the essence of the SRC sentence accurately. The translation variations are stylistic and do not change the fundamental meaning or context of the original sentence.
Illegal → illegal → Fotografierverbot  	take pictures → die Bilder → Fotografier  		**Explanation:** The phrase "illegal" in HYP is a mistranslation. The REF uses "Fotografierverbot" which conveys the meaning of banning or making illegal the act of taking pictures. Additionally, "take pictures" is mistranslated as "die Bilder," where "Fotografier" (from the word "Fotografierverbot") would better capture the intended meaning of taking pictures.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP and REF translations generally present the intended meaning and use of the sentence, with both not showing any mistranslation that significantly changes meaning from the SRC.
voters → Wähler → Wähler  	booth → Reihe → Wahlkabine  		**Explanation:**  	- "Reihe" in HYP is a mistranslation of "booth"/"Wahlkabine" from SRC/REF.	
savages → rettet → fällt über  	Metropolitan → Metropolitanische → Metropolitan  	Hamlets → Hamles → Hamlets  
agent → Agenten → Stellvertreter
guilty → für schuldig → schuldig  	beyond reasonable doubt → N/A → hinreichend  	criminal standard of proof → strafrechtlicher Ebene → hohen Anforderungen im strafrechtlichen Verfahren  		**Explanation:**  	1. "für schuldig" in HYP adds "für," which is not present in REF and slightly changes its implication from simply "schuldig."  	2. "beyond reasonable doubt" is referred to implicitly in REF as "hinreichend," which HYP omits or does not adequately capture.  	3. "criminal standard of proof" in SRC conceptually matches "hohen Anforderungen im strafrechtlichen Verfahren" in REF, which is not adequately captured by "strafrechtlicher Ebene" in HYP.
Kreishallen → Wahlregistrierungsabteilungen → town hall electoral registration departments
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC. The HYP word "Weckruf" is contextually appropriate as a translation for "wake-up call," though the REF uses "Warnsignal," both terms convey similar meanings in this context.
Nation → Nation → Land  	denial → Verleugnung → Leugnung  	bodies → Organe → Behörden

- Männer → Frau → Mannschaftsmitglied  	- Frau → (none) → Brady Ellison  	- weg → (none) → links  	- Köder → Köder → Kindheit  		**Explanation:** "Männer" in HYP should be "Mannschaftsmitglied" as it accurately reflects the context of a team member from both SRC and REF, "Frau" seems unnecessary and incorrect for Brady Ellison in this context, "weg" should be "links" indicating position, and "Köder" is a clear mistranslation of "Kindheit" from the SRC context.
Doppelgesang → Doppelgängerin → Doppelgängerin  	Radfahren → Radrennbahn → Radrennbahn  	Erachter → Bogenschütze → Bogenschütze
U.S. → U.S.'s → Das  	des Mitglied → Team of Archery Team → Mannschaftsmitglied  	Männern → (None) → im Bogenschießen  	schlecht → (None) → unheimlich  		**Explanation:**  	- "U.S." is unnecessarily possessive in HYP with "U.S.'s," differing from REF's appropriate use "Das."  	- "Team of Archery Team" is an incorrect translation of "Men's Archery Team member," which is concisely "Mannschaftsmitglied" in REF.  	- "Männern" ("of men") is an inappropriate addition not needed in "Mannschaftsmitglied" as seen in REF to indicate the archery team lineup.  	- "schlecht" implies "poorly," an incorrect translation of "eerily," represented correctly by "unheimlich" in REF.
archer → Dachdiener → Bogenschütze  	frenzy → Verdrossenheit → Wahnsinn  	kid → Köder → Kindheit
1. beside → neben → mit Ausnahme  	2. told → erzählte → teilte  	3. Huffington Post → Huffington Post die → der Huffington Post  		**Explanation:**  	1. "neben" in HYP is a mistranslation of "besides"/"mit Ausnahme" from SRC/REF, affecting the context.	2. "erzählte" in HYP doesn't accurately convey "told"/"teilte mit" from SRC/REF, changing the construction.	3. "die" in HYP is incorrectly placed with "Huffington Post", disrupting grammar compared to "der Huffington Post" in REF.
good-looking → gut ausgerichtete → gutaussehender  	dude → Täuschung → Kerl
Langjumper → Weitspringer → Weitspringer  		**Explanation:** "Langjumper" in HYP is a mistranslation of "long jumper" from SRC and "Weitspringer" in REF, which refers to an athlete performing long jumps, thus altering the meaning.
gymnast → Sänger → Turnerin  	expressive → ausdrücklichen → ausdrucksstarken  	dead → toter → Doppelgängerin  
Pool → Schwimmbecken → Schwimmbecken  	verglichen → Vergleich → verglichen  		**Explanation:** "Pool," when referring contextually to a swimming environment, is best translated as "Schwimmbecken." Additionally, "Vergleich" is not the correct form in the context; the action of comparing someone over time should use "verglichen."
Nathan → NATO → Nathan  	Inception → Anfängers → Inception Schauspielers
brow → Brosamen → Augenbrauen  	boast → rühmt → aufweist  
Efimova → Julia → Yulia  	versenkte → versunken → sonnengebräunte  	Haar → Haar → Haare  	Teams → Teams → Amerikaner  	Gorgon → Gorgon → Gordon

einziger → nur → die  	user → Nutzer → User  	Ähnlichsten → Ähnlichkeiten → Ähnlichkeiten  		**Explanation:** "Nur" in HYP doesn't convey the intended sense of "only" as in exclusively or uniquely, which "die Einzige" does. "Nutzer" and "User" in REF aren't a significant error, but that choice can better reflect source consistency. The translation of "similarities" in HYP to "Ähnlichsten" is incorrect and needs "Ähnlichkeiten" as in the REF.
Floating → [not translated] → in den Raum gestellt  	user → Benutzer → User  	looks → Aussichten → Ähnlichkeit
One → Ein → Eine  	user → Twitterer → Twitter-Userin  	his → seine → ihre  	happiness → Freude → Zufriedenheit  	thinks → der Ansicht ist → denkt  	Hope → Hoffnung → Hope  		**Explanation:** 	1. "One" in SRC was mistranslated as "Ein" in HYP, where "Eine" in REF genders the noun properly according to "Userin".	2. "user" in SRC was mistranslated as "Twitterer" in HYP, where "Twitter-Userin" in REF retains both gender and context.	3. "her" corresponds to "seine" in HYP, a gender mismatch with "ihre" in REF.	4. "happiness" was mistranslated as "Freude" in HYP, whereas "Zufriedenheit" in REF offers a better contextual fit.	5. "thinks" was translated as "der Ansicht ist" in HYP, while "denkt" in REF is more straightforward and fitting.	6. "Hope" was mistakenly translated as "Hoffnung" in HYP, unlike its unchanged state in REF.
USA soccer star → Fußballstar der USA → US-Fußballstar  	Dexter actress → Schauspieler Dexter → Dexter Schauspielerin
1. popular → Bevölkerung → beliebte  	2. comparisons have included → Vergleiche waren → Vergleiche umfassten  	3. actress → Actress → Schauspielerin  	4. gymnast → Goldmedailler → Goldmedaillengewinnerin im Turnen  
apologizes → entschuldigt sich dafür → entschuldigt sich  	swimmer → Schwimmer → Schwimmerin  	'the' → Der → die  	'a pig → ein Schweinefleisch → ein Schwein  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Apologizes" mistranslated as "entschuldigt sich dafür," where "dafür" is unnecessary and changes emphasis.  	2. "Swimmer" is gender-neutral, but "Schwimmer" in HYP implies male, whereas REF specifies "Schwimmerin," aligning with German's word gender rules.  	3. English article 'the' doesn't require translation directly to "Der" in German for "CBC-Kommentator"; REF omits it, contextualizing as "die."  	4. "'a pig'" is mistranslated as "ein Schweinefleisch," turning 'pig' into 'pork,' which alters the meaning.

1. Macfarfare → Macfarlane → Macfarlane  	2. Anzeiger → Kommentator → Kommentator  	3. Schweinefleisch → Schwein → Schwein  	4. Schwimmer → Schwimmerin → Schwimmerin  		**Explanation:**  	- "Macfarfare" in the HYP sentence is a mistranslation of "Macfarlane" from SRC and REF.  	- "Anzeiger" in HYP is a mistranslation for "Kommentator" from the SRC and REF.  	- "Schweinefleisch" in HYP incorrectly translates to "Schwein" in both SRC and REF, which changes the meaning from "pig" to "pork".  	- "Schwimmer" in HYP mismatches the gender described in the REF sentence as "Schwimmerin".
idiot → wusste nicht → hat nicht kapiert  	realize → Luft → Sendung  		**Explanation:** 	- "wusste nicht" in HYP is a mistranslation of "realize" which REF translates as "hat nicht kapiert," aligning more closely with the context. 	- "Luft" in HYP incorrectly translates "air" which, in the broadcasting sense used in SRC, should be "Sendung" as per REF.

No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation (HYP) accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The differences in word choice between HYP and REF are minor and contextually equivalent (e.g., "unglückliche Wortwahl" vs. "unglücklich gewählte Formulierung" and "wir bedauern" vs. "es tut uns leid"), serving the same overall meaning without introducing significant mistranslations.
more than → mehr als → über  	tweeted → Zettel → über Twitter  		**Explanation:** "mehr als" in HYP is not the correct translation for "more than," which should be "über" as seen in REF. The word "Zettel" in HYP is a mistranslation of "tweeted," which should be "über Twitter" based on context from REF.

shoppers → Geschäfter → Käufer  	stripped → abgeriegelt → auszog  	knickers → Knickern → Unterhosen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Geschäfter" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Shoppers"/"Käufer" from SRC/REF, altering the meaning to imply "shops" instead of customers.	- "abgeriegelt" in HYP means "locked up" or "sealed off," which does not match the intended action of "stripped"/"auszog" in SRC/REF.	- "Knickern" in HYP is a nonsensical term in this context and mistranslates "knickers"/"Unterhosen" from SRC/REF.

three more pairs → drei weiteren Papiere → drei weiteren Unterhosen  	got dressed → wurde gekleidet → zog sich an  		**Explanation:** "Papiere" in HYP is a mistranslation of "pairs"/"Unterhosen" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning.

No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The differences between HYP and REF are minor and do not change the overall meaning significantly—both adequately convey the message from the source sentence.
All → gesamte → Alle  	product → Produkt → Produkte  		**Explanation:** "Gesamte" in HYP is a mistranslation of "All"/"Alle" from SRC/REF. "Produkt" in HYP is incorrectly singular, whereas the context requires the plural "Produkte" as in REF.

approached → mit → nähert  	front → Tisch → vorne  	behind → Tisch → hinten  		**Explanation:** "Mit" in HYP is a mistranslation of "approached"/"nähert" from SRC/REF. "Tisch" in HYP is a mistranslation of both "front"/"vorne" and "behind"/"hinten," significantly distorting the context and meaning.

You → Sie → Ergreifen  	grasp → verstehen → ergreifen  	forearm → Arm → Vorderarm  	free elbow → Freibrief → freien Ellbogen  
Knee → Knie → Knie  	groin → Getreide → Leiste  	doubles → verdoppelt → zusammenkrümmt  	twist → verdoppelt → verdrehen  	back up → hinter sich → bewegen sich rückwärts  	trained → ausgebildet → richten  		**Explanation:**  	- "Knee" is correctly translated to "Knie" in HYP, matching REF. Hence, no error here despite the context.	- "Groin" is mistranslated in HYP as "Getreide," whereas the correct translation in REF is "Leiste."	- "Doubles" is mistranslated as "verdoppelt" which is unrelated to "doubles up in pain." The correct translation in REF is "zusammenkrümmt."	- "Twist" is mistranslated as "verdoppelt," unrelated to the action described. It is correctly translated as "verdrehen" in REF.	- "Back up" is mistranslated as "hinter sich"; the correct context (moving backward) is captured in REF as "bewegen sich rückwärts."	- "Trained" is improperly captured by "ausgebildet," whereas the context calls for "gerichtet" as in REF ("richten").

mugging → Schmuggel → Raub
tongue → Sprache → Zunge  	scrapes → schrottet → schabt  
gag → Glücksreflex → Würgereflex  	licking → geknebelt → ableckte  		**Explanation:**  	"Glücksreflex" in the HYP is a mistranslation of "gag reflex"/"Würgereflex" from the SRC/REF, altering the meaning of the sentence.  	Similarly, "geknbelet" (gagged) in HYP is a mistranslation of "licked"/"ableckte," changing the intended action of the sentence significantly.
Presenter → Reisebriefer → Moderator  	scraped → schrottete → schabte  	tongue → Sprache → Zunge  	note → Note → Schein  	hand rail → Handschiene → Geländer  	button → Toilettenknote → Spülknopf  
Before → Bevor → Vor  	licking → durchzog → Ablecken  	object → Objekt → Objekts  	luminometer → Luminemeter → Luminometer
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation (HYP) and reference translation (REF) both adequately convey the meaning of the source sentence, with no significant single-word mistranslations that alter the overall context or meaning.
thought → Gedanke → Gedanke  	licking → kleben → abzulecken  	train's flush button → Zugknopf → Spülknopf einer Zugtoilette  	repellent → widersinnig → abstoßend  	kitchen sink → Küchensenke → Küchenspüle  		**Explanation:** The provided HYP translation contains several single-word translation errors. "Kleben" is a mistranslation of "licking" as it means "stick", "Zugknopf" does not accurately communicate "train's flush button", "widersinnig" means "nonsensical" instead of "repellent", and "Küchensenke" is an incorrect translation of "kitchen sink". Each of these errors significantly changes the meaning and context compared to the SRC and REF.
bacteria → Bakterien → Darmbakterien  		**Explanation:** "Bakterien" in HYP translates to "bacteria" which is a partial translation. The correct term from REF is "Darmbakterien" which specifies "gut bacteria" from SRC. This is a significant mistranslation as it changes the specific subject of the discussion.
he → ihm → er  	licked → [missing] → ableckte  		**Explanation:** "Ihm" in HYP translates to "him," but the original SRC intended the action connected to "he," aligning with "er" in REF. Additionally, "licked" is completely omitted in the HYP translation, which should correspond with "ableckte" in REF.
Widerstandsfähigkeit → Dauerhaftigkeit → Darms  	eigenartige → weiße → eigenartige  
handrails → Händen → Geländern  	flush button → Toilettenpulver → Spülknöpfen von Toiletten  		**Explanation:** "Händen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "handrails"/"Geländern" in SRC/REF, and "Toilettenpulver" is a mistranslation of "flush button"/"Spülknöpfen von Toiletten" in SRC/REF, which changes the meaning significantly.
kid → Köder → Kind  	carefree → ungesühnt → unbesorgt  	soil → Boden → Erde  	worms → Wärme → Würmer  		**Explanation:** "Köder" means "bait", not "kid". "Ungesühnt" translates to "unatoned", not "carefree". "Boden" generally means "ground", not specifically "soil". "Wärme" translates to "warmth" instead of "worms". These choices change the meaning of the sentence significantly.
No translation errors detected.
turned down → distanziert → ablehnte  	Russian → russischen → in Russland  		**Explanation:**  	1. "turned down" in SRC is mistranslated as "distanziert" (distanced) in HYP, whereas the correct translation in REF is "ablehnte" (rejected).	2. "Russian" in SRC is mistranslated as "russischen" (Russian) in HYP, but the correct reference to context would be "in Russland" (in Russia) as in REF, implying location rather than an adjective describing the toilet.
sample swab → Stichprobenspaltung → Probeabstrich  	luminometer → Luminemateur → Luminometer  		**Explanation:**  	- "Stichprobenspaltung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "sample swab"/"Probeabstrich" from SRC/REF.	- "Luminemateur" in HYP is a mistranslation of "luminometer"/"Luminometer" from SRC/REF.
**No translation errors detected.**  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately reflects the meaning of the SRC sentence when compared to the REF. The difference in phrasing between HYP and REF does not lead to a significant change in meaning or context.
Russian → Russland → russische  	lick → klinken → abzulecken  	count → Erzählung → Zahl
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio → kein Fehler ← Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio  	different → an einem anderen Ort → verschiedene  	place → Ort → Orten  		**Explanation:**  	- "an einem anderen Ort" in HYP is a mistranslation of "different place"/"verschiedenen Orten" from SRC/REF, as it suggests a singular and alternative location rather than multiple different places.	- "Ort" in HYP is a mistranslation of "place"/"Orten" from SRC/REF, because it is singular in HYP where the context requires plural (places).
he → Er → er  	said → sagte → sagt  	close → fast → nahe  	things → Dinge → Sachen  	smelled → geschriegen → gerochen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Er" should be lowercase "er" as per German rules for pronouns unless starting a sentence.	2. "sagte" means "said" but the reference uses "sagt" to provide a more direct translation.	3. "fast" means "almost", while "nahe" means "close to", reflecting a translation error in contextual meaning.	4. "Dinge" translates correctly as "things", but the translation introduces an alternative referring to the context.	5. "geschriegen" means "screamed", while "gerochen" means "smelled", which is a significant meaning error.
No translation errors detected.
lick → vertuschen → anlecken  	dort → hier → hier  	abscheulich → ekelhaft → ekelhaft  		**Explanation:** "Vertuschen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "lick"/"anlecken" from SRC/REF. "Dort" in HYP translates to "there," while "hier" in REF translates to "here," both cannot coexist contextually. "Abscheulich" in HYP does not align well with "ekelhaft" from REF, as they have distinct intensity levels in description.
Lickhiker's → Lichker → Lickhiker's  	Strength → Strenge → Strength  		**Explanation:** "Lichker" and "Strenge" in HYP are mistranslations of "Lickhiker's" and "Strength" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning and context.
1. lactic → lackistische → Milchsäure  	2. gut → Stiefmütter → Darm  
Juice → Justiz → Säfte
probiotics → Antibiotika → Probiotika  		**Explanation:** "Antibiotika" in HYP is a mistranslation of "probiotics"/"Probiotika" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.
nennen → anrufen → anrufen
interest in gut health → Interesse an der Gärtengesundheit → Interesse an Darmgesundheit
Gummigesundheit → Darmgesundheit → Darmgesundheit  		**Explanation:** "Gummigesundheit" in HYP is a mistranslation of "gut health"/"Darmgesundheit" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.

yobs → Beschäftigten → asoziale  	council house → Ratshaus → Sozialwohnung
Eigentum → Eigentum → Anwesen  		**Explanation:** "Eigentum" in HYP is a mistranslation in the context of the sentence, as the REF uses "Anwesen," which more accurately reflects "property" in the given context.
property → Besitz → Anwesen  	housing associations officers → Wohnungsbehörden → Angestellte der Wohnungsgenossenschaft  	disrepair → Reparatur → irreparablen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Besitz" (HYP) is incorrect for "property"/"Anwesen" (SRC/REF). "Besitz" implies possession, whereas "Anwesen" refers to the physical property.	2. "Wohnungsbehörden" (HYP) is a mistranslation and doesn't match the context of "housing associations officers"/"Angestellte der Wohnungsgenossenschaft" (SRC/REF). "Behörden" means authorities, not officers.	3. "Reparatur" (HYP) is the opposite of "state of disrepair"/"irrepairable" (SRC/REF) and changes the sentence's meaning significantly.
1. floorboards → Fußboden → Holzdielen  	2. ripped up → gefüllt → aufgerissen  	3. strewn → gepflastert → verstreut  	4. daubed → begraben → geschmiert  		**Explanation:** These are mistranslations where the context and meaning significantly differ between the HYP and REF sentences.
have been moved on → ist getrieben worden → wurden umgesiedelt
Cornwall Housing → Cornwall House → Cornwall Housing  	retten → reparieren → reparieren  		**Explanation:**  	- "Cornwall Housing" in SRC should be translated as "Cornwall Housing" in REF, whereas "Cornwall House" was incorrectly used in HYP.  	- "retten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "reparieren" from SRC/REF in the context of saving a housing facility.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words in HYP adequately correspond to the SRC and REF, with no significant mistranslations that alter the meaning or context. Minor variations such as synonyms and sentence structure differences do not constitute meaningful translation errors.
property → Eigentum → Anwesen  	Element → Element → Teil  		**Explanation:** "Eigentum" in HYP is an incorrect translation of "property", which should be "Anwesen" in REF. "Element" in HYP for "element" is contextually incorrect compared to "Teil" in the REF, which means "part".
family → Familie → Familie  	name → Name → Ruf  		**Explanation:** The word "name" in the HYP is a direct mistranslation of "name"/"Ruf" from the SRC/REF, altering the intended meaning by using "Name" instead of the more contextually appropriate "Ruf". Despite the exact translation of "family" being "Familie" in HYP and "Die Familie" in REF, both are contextually accurate, indicating no error with "family".
1. couple → Paare → Paar  	2. intermittently → lebten → zwischenzeitlich  	3. property → Besitztümern → Wohnung  	4. fighting → Kämpfe → Straßenkämpfe  	5. baseball → Baselschlägen → Baseballschlägern  	6. arguments → Argumente → Streiten  	7. swearing → Verrat → Fluchen  
name → Name → Name  	tenancy → Zaun → Mietvertrag  	antisocial → unsozialem → antisoziales  		**Explanation:** "Name" is appropriately translated, but for clarity, note that "Zaun" in HYP incorrectly translates "tenancy"/"Mietvertrag" from SRC/REF, and "unsozialem" should be "antisoziales" to match "antisocial" from SRC.
No translation errors detected.
boards → Vorstände → Holzdielen  	dealt → behandelt → gehandelt  		**Explanation:** "Vorstände" in HYP is a mistranslation of "boards"/"Holzdielen" in SRC/REF, and "behandelt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "dealt"/"gehandelt" in SRC/REF, changing both the meaning and context significantly.
1. were → kämpfen → sahen  	2. called → aufgerufen → angerufen
Housing → House → Housing  	forcefully → mit Nachdruck → gewaltsam  	property → Eigentum → Anwesen  	move on voluntarily → Fortbewegung → auszuziehen  		**Explanation:**  	- "House" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Housing"/"Housing" from SRC/REF, as the organization name should be retained as "Housing."  	- "mit Nachdruck" translates to "emphatically", but the correct translation should be "gewaltsam", which means "forcefully."  	- "Eigentum" (property/ownership) should match the more specific "Anwesen" (estate/property) in the context provided by the SRC/REF. 	- "Fortbewegung" (locomotion/movement) is not the correct term for "move on" in this context, where "auszuziehen" (to move out) matches the intended meaning.
eviction → Vertreibung → Delogierung  	relieved → befreundeten → erleichterten  	living hell → lebendig geworden → zur Hölle gemacht
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words in the HYP ("Einer sagte: 'Sie kümmern sich um niemanden'.") align closely with the meaning of the words in the REF ("Einer sagte aus: 'Sie scherten sich um niemanden.'"). The words 'säen'/'scherten' and 'kümmern' both convey the idea of caring, and 'said'/'sagte' and 'said'/'sagte aus' both accurately convey the action of speaking, making the differences negligible in terms of single-word mistranslations.
No translation errors detected.
amount → Häufigkeit → unzähligen  	times → [not translated] → Male  	down → heruntergesehen → sehen
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation "Heute Morgen konnten wir nicht schlafen" and the REF translation "Heute morgen konnten wir nicht schlafen" adequately reflect the meaning of the source sentence. The difference in capitalization between "Morgen" and "morgen" is a minor style choice and does not affect the translation accuracy.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC and aligns with the intention of the REF, with no single-word mistranslations that significantly alter the context or meaning.
Fitzpatrick → House → Fitzpatrick		**Explanation:** "House" in HYP is a mistranslation or error likely due to a parsing mistake related to "Cornwall Housing" in SRC/REF. "Fitzpatrick" should be a part of the proper noun and not translate into "House".
police → Polizei → Polizei  	have lived → lebt → lebte  		**Explanation:**  	1. "lebt" (present tense) in HYP should be translated as "lebte" (past tense) as in REF, to match the past tense "have lived" in SRC.	2. The use of "Eigentum" in this sentence contextually fits and does not change the meaning significantly compared to "zum Haus". Thus, it is not flagged as an error.
Rubbish → Müll → Müll  	old toys → altes Spielzeug → alte Spielzeuge  	overgrown → überwachsene → überwucherten  	council house → Ratshaus → Gemeindehaus  		**Explanation:**  	- "Rubbish," "old toys," and "overgrown" have adequately translated synonyms or minor differences, so "Rubbish" and "old toys" are not incorrect; they're just different variants.	- The translation of "overgrown" from SRC to HYP ("überwachsene") versus REF ("überwucherten") is a stylistic choice and not erroneous.	- The significant translation issue here is with "council house," translated as "Ratshaus" in HYP, which does not convey the intended meaning of "Gemeindehaus" in REF which more accurately reflects the intended type of public building.
tenant → Mieter → der Mieter  	House → House → Housing  	Vertreibung → Vertreibung → Delogierung  		**Explanation:** In the German translation:	- "Mieter" in HYP and REF both refer to "tenant," but the exact phrasing with "der Mieter" in REF clarifies responsibility, a minor discrepancy but maintaining contextual meaning.	- "House" in HYP is not the correct translation for "Housing." The REF appropriately uses "Housing", maintaining the brand name.	- "Vertreibung" (eviction) stands for "Delogierung" in the REF. Although both terms mean eviction in different contexts, "Delogierung" is more specific to housing terms.
No translation errors detected.
Gemeinschaft → Gemeinde → Gemeinde  	aufkamen → zugegangen sind → zugegangen sind  		**Explanation:** "Gemeinschaft" in HYP is a mistranslation of "community"/"Gemeinde" from SRC/REF, and "aufkamen" does not fit the sense of "came forward" as captured by "zugegangen sind" in REF.
comfort → Trost bringt → Trost spenden  	message → Signal → Botschaft  	antisocial → unsoziales → antisoziales
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The translation of the key terms and concepts between SRC, HYP, and REF sentences do not exhibit any significant change in meaning or context when considering the single-word level.
mattress → Muttstat → Matratze  	floor → Boden → Boden (contextual adjustment needed, "Boden" is correct but contextually should match "on the floor" not "in the floor")  	bedrooms → Fundamente → Schlafzimmer  	eviction → Vertreibung → Delogierung  		**Explanation:** The words "Muttstat," "Fundamente," and "Vertreibung" in HYP are mistranslations of "mattress," "bedrooms," and "eviction" from SRC/REF, changing the overall accuracy and context significantly. The use of "Boden" in the structure "im Boden" is incorrect in context, as "auf dem Boden" captures the sense of "on the floor" correctly.
workers → Wohnarbeiter → Arbeiter  	piles → Müllplätze → Müllberge
70g → 700 g → 70g  	scales → Skalen → Waagen  	paraphernalia → Paraphornalia → Paraphernalien  		**Explanation:**  	1. The amount "70g" in SRC and REF is mistranslated as "700 g" in HYP.	2. "Skalen" in HYP incorrectly translates "scales" from SRC, which should be "Waagen" as in REF.	3. "Paraphornalia" in HYP has a typographical error compared to "paraphernalia" in SRC and "Paraphernalien" in REF.
possession → beworben → Besitz  	to supply → beworben → Handelsabsicht
money → Geld → Geld  	going → gehe → sei  	headstone → Kopfstein → Grabstein  	died → starb → ums Leben kam  		**Explanation:** While "Geld" is correct in HYP, errors in HYP include the use of "gehe" instead of "sei," "Kopfstein" instead of "Grabstein," and "starb" instead of "ums Leben kam," affecting the accuracy and context of the translation.
obdachlos → obdachlos → ohne Obdach  	Privatwohnungen → Privatwohnungen → einer privaten Unterkunft
walls → Mauern → Zimmerwände  	graffiti → Gitafiti → Graffiti  	scrawled → zerstreut → beschmiert
tenants → Briefe → Mieter  	evict → verurteilen → delogieren
eviction → Beweisung → Delogierung

Tourists → Küstenschifffahrt → Sonnenanbeter
Portuguese → portugiesische → portugisiesches  	plane → schlug → Flugzeug  	air force → Luftwaffe → Luftstreitkräfte  		**Explanation:**  	1. "portugiesische" is a slight spelling error compared to "portugisiesches" in REF.	2. "schlug" is incorrectly translating as "plane" instead of "Flugzeug."	3. "Luftwaffe" is a mistranslation in context for "air force," which is more accurately "Luftstreitkräfte."	
No translation errors detected.
terrified → schreckliche → verängstigte  	low-flying → Niedriglohnjet → tieffliegender  	packed → verpackten → vollen
footage → Bilder → Videoaufnahmen  	sunseekers → Sonnenstraße → Sonnenanbetern  	sand → Sonnenstraße → Strandabschnitt  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Bilder" (HYP) translates to "images" instead of "footage" which should be "Videoaufnahmen" as in REF.  	2. "Sonnenstraße" (HYP) translates to "sun street," which is incorrect compared to "sunseekers"/"Sonnenanbetern" in SRC/REF.  	3. "Sonnenstraße" (HYP) again incorrectly translates "sand" which should be closer to "Strandabschnitt" as in REF.
rose → stiegen → sprangen  	jet engines → Jetmotoren → Düsentriebwerke  		**Explanation:**  	- "Rose" in SRC is mistranslated to "stiegen" in HYP, while "sprangen" in REF more accurately conveys the suddenness implied in the context.	- "Jet engines" in SRC is mistranslated to "Jetmotoren" in HYP, where "Düsentriebwerke" in REF is the more accurate technical term.
No translation errors detected.
social media → sozialen Medien → sozialen Medien  	holidaymakers → Urlaubern → Urlauber  	fly-by → Fliegens → Fly-By  		**Explanation:**  	1. "fly-by" in SRC and REF is mistranslated as "Fliegens" in HYP, changing the meaning from a specific aviation term to a general term.  	2. "holidaymakers" in SRC and "Urlauber" in REF imply a collective group; "Urlaubern" in HYP is a minor variation and thus not a significant error.	3. "social media" in both HYP and REF correctly translates the same term from SRC, so no error there.		The primary concern is the translation of "fly-by" to "Fliegens" which alters the intended meaning.
surfing → suchte → am Surfen  	swear → vereidige → es fühlte sich so an
appeared → kam → kam  	murk → Mund → Dunkelheit  	incredibly → in → unglaublich  	low altitude → Höhe → tief  		**Explanation:**  		1. "appeared" and "kam" both correctly translate the action of the plane coming into view, so it isn't listed as an error.	2. "Mund" in HYP is a mistranslation of "murk"/"Dunkelheit" from SRC/REF. "Mund" means "mouth," a clear error in this context.	3. "in" in HYP is directly translated as "in," which is incorrect in this context. It should match with "incredibly" as "unglaublich."	4. "low altitude" in HYP is a more literal translation of "niedrigen Höhe" from SRC. However, "tief" in REF is a more appropriate translation in this context, capturing the intended meaning of flying low.
Air Force → Luftwaffe → Luftstreitkräfte  	fell → fallen → fliegen  
He → Er → Der Sprecher  	jet → die Jet → der Jet  	flown → untergeflogen → flog  		**Explanation:**  	- "He" in HYP should be translated as "Der Sprecher" in REF, giving the context a more specific meaning.	- "die Jet" in HYP should be "der Jet" according to REF for correct gender agreement.	- "flown" is mistranslated as "untergeflogen" in HYP, which means 'flown under', whereas "flog" (flew) is more accurate according to REF's context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The translation differences between HYP and REF are minor and do not constitute clear translation errors. The meanings are contextually equivalent and accurately convey the information from the source sentence.

No translation errors detected.
Catalan → katalanische → Katalanen  	away → weggefahrenen → auswärts  	Supercup → Supecup → Supercup  	leg → Bein → Rückspiel  
two-time → zweimaligen → Doublegewinner  	finalists → Spielfinalismen → Cupfinalisten  	Europa League → Europameisterschaften → Europa-League  	playing → spielen → bestreitet  	tournament → Tourismus → Turnier  		**Explanation:**  	- "zweimaligen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "two-time"/"Doublegewinner" from SRC/REF.  	- "Spielfinalismen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "finalists"/"Cupfinalisten" from SRC/REF.  	- "Europameisterschaften" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Europa League"/"Europa-League" from SRC/REF.  	- "spielen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "playing"/"bestreitet" from SRC/REF.  	- "Tourismus" in HYP is a mistranslation of "tournament"/"Turnier" from SRC/REF.
goalkeeper → Ziegenhalter → Goalie/goalkeeper  		**Explanation:** "Ziegenhalter" in HYP is a mistranslation of "goalkeeper"/"Goalie" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the meaning and context.
pulled → gezogen → erlitt  	ligament → Klagelied → Bänderstauchung  	German → Deutschland → Deutsche  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation contains noticeable errors where "gezogen" is incorrectly used for "pulled," "Klagelied" for "ligament," and "Deutschland" for "German" in this context. These substitutions significantly alter the intended meaning from the SRC sentence, and the REF offers the correct translations.
Chilean → chilenische → chilenische  	international → Internationale → Internationale  	Ter Steigen → Ter Steigen → Ter Stegen  		**Explanation:**  	- The proper name "Ter Steigen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Ter Stegen" in both the SRC sentence and REF translation.
Bravo → Spitzfindigkeiten → Bravo
doubts → Zweifel → Zweifel  	fitness → Eignung → Fitnesszustand  	compulsory → obligatorischen → Pflicht  	friendly → freundlichen → Test  		**Explanation:**  	- "Eignung" (HYP) mistranslates "fitness" (SRC) which is correctly reflected as "Fitnesszustand" (REF), significantly altering the meaning.	- "obligatorischen" (HYP) mistranslates "compulsory" (SRC) which should be "Pflicht" (REF) for contextual accuracy.	- "freundlichen" (HYP) mistranslates "friendly" (SRC) which should be "Test" (REF) for contextual accuracy.		Other terms like "Zweifel" are correct in both translations.
3-2 → 3:2 → 3:2  	friendly → Freund → Probegalopp
2-3 extra-time → 2-3 Extra → 2:3-Niederlage nach Verlängerung  	Supercup → Supercus → europäischen Supercup  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence, with "Siegen" and "Rekordinhaber" adequately capturing the sense of "victories" and "record-holders" compared to the REF translation. Any differences are minor and do not change the meaning significantly.
Gold → nimmt → zu		**Explanation:** "nimmt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "taking" from SRC and does not match contextual usage as found in REF, where "zu" is used in the context of achieving or securing Gold in table tennis.
Ma Long → Ma Long → Ma Long  	table tennis → tennisolympische → Tischtennis  	champion → Kämpfer → Olympiasieger  		**Explanation:**  	- "Ma Long" in both HYP and REF adequately translates "Ma Long" from SRC and does not require a change.	- "tennisolympische" in HYP is a mistranslation of "table tennis"/"Tischtennis" from SRC/REF, as it omits the "table" aspect of "table tennis".	- "Kämpfer" in HYP is a mistranslation of "champion"/"Olympiasieger" from SRC/REF, which alters the meaning significantly.
beat → Schlag → besiegte  	final → Endfassung → Finale  	defending champion → Verteidiger → Titelverteidiger  		**Explanation:**		- "Schlag" in HYP is a mistranslation of "beat/besiegte," which changes the meaning from an action (beating/opponent) to a noun (hit).	- "Endfassung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "final/Finale," altering the meaning and context of the event described.	- "Verteidiger" in HYP is incorrect for "defending champion/Titelverteidiger," which changes the nuance from champion status to defense in general.
World Championship → Weltmeisterschaft → WM  	World Cup → Weltmeisterschaft → Weltcup  	final tournament → letzte Turnkammer → World-Tour-Finalturnier  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Weltmeisterschaft" is used twice in HYP, incorrectly translating both "World Championship" and "World Cup".  	2. "letzte Turnkammer" is a mistranslation of "final tournament", differing from REF's "World-Tour-Finalturnier".
bronze → Bronzemedale → Bronze  	ging → von → an den Japaner
Chinese men → chinesischen Männer → Chinesen  	final → Abschluss → Endspiel  	fought → gekämpft → machten aus  
athlete → Sportler → Chinese  	singles → einzigen → Einzel-Titel
The following translation errors were detected:		athlete → Sportler → Nicht-Chinese  	Lower Austria → Unterösterreich → NÖ  	non-Chinese → nicht-chinesische → Nicht-Chinese  		**Explanation:**  	- "Sportler" in HYP translates back to "athlete", but the correct term based on SRC is "Nicht-Chinese", matching the REF translation.	- "Unterösterreich" in HYP translates back to "Lower Austria", which could be contextually misleading or redundant without "NÖ", as correctly used in the REF translation.	- "nicht-chinesische" in HYP isn't perfectly aligning with "Nicht-Chinese", as used in REF, which mirrors the SRC term with precision.
stood → standen → waren  	coaches → Reisebusse → Coaches  	sets → Stationen → Sätzen
charges → Anschuldigungen → Schützlinge
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence "Bisher habe ich für mein Land gespielt." and the REF sentence "Die Matches bis hierher habe ich für mein Land gespielt." both convey the intended meaning of the SRC sentence "Up until now, I have played for my country." The differences are stylistic and do not significantly change the meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words in the HYP sentence are appropriately translated and align well with the meaning of the SRC and REF sentences, considering variations in phrasing.
gold and silver medallists → Gold- und Silbermedaillen → Gold- und Silbermedaillengewinner  	posed → stellten → posierten  	with → unter → mit
No translation errors detected.
28-year-old → 28 Jahre alten → 28-jährigen
pace → Tempo → bestimmte  	table → Tisch → Platte  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Tempo" in HYP adequately matches with "pace" from SRC and "Tempo" in REF, but the action verb related to "set the pace" in SRC is "determined" (bestimmte) in REF, altering the intended meaning in the context significantly.  	2. "Tisch" (table) in HYP is a mistranslation of "Platte" (which can refer to a playing surface, like a tennis table) in REF. This change affects the context significantly, especially if referring to a sports context like table tennis where "Platte" is pertinent.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation conveys the meaning of SRC adequately, with no clear mistranslations in individual words when compared to REF. Differences such as "Dominanz Mas" and "Überlegenheit von Ma" or "das Spiel" and "das erwartete mitreißende Match" reflect stylistic choices but do not constitute significant errors.
volleys → Vollen → Ballwechsel  		**Explanation:** "Vollen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "volleys"/"Ballwechsel" from SRC/REF, which impacts the accuracy of the translation.
bronze medal match → Bronzenmedailspiel → Spiel um Bronze
1. Belarussian → Belarussen → Weißrusse  	2. rib → Quartalsschluss → Rippenverletzung
Tafelnis → Tafelnis → Tischtennis  		**Explanation:** "Tafelnis" in HYP is a mistranslation of "table tennis"/"Tischtennis" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the sense of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence. While there are stylistic differences between HYP and REF ("großen Angst" vs. "massiven Sorgen"), they both convey the concept of significant fears, with no clear mistranslation of single words that changes the meaning.
No translation errors detected.
millionäre → millionäre → Multimillionär  	Leistung → Leistung → Auftreten  	Korrespondentenbericht → Korrespondentenbericht → berichteten  	analoges → analoges → so etwas wie  	Zweifel → Zweifel → Bedenken  		**Explanation:**  	1. "millionäre Millionär" in HYP doesn't match the "Multimillionär" in REF; the repetition is incorrect.	2. "Leistung" is translated as "performance," but contextually "Auftreten" (behavior or bearing) would be a more accurate term.	3. "Korrespondentenbericht" (correspondents' report) was incorrectly used as a noun instead of a verb ("berichteten").	4. "Analoges zum Zweifel" (analogous to doubt) fails to convey the intended nuanced meaning of "Bedenken" (concerns or hesitations).	
Rivalen → Frage → Zweifel  	geschlagen → Frage → Zweifel  		**Explanation:** "Frage" and "geschlagen" in HYP are mistranslations of "doubt"/"Zweifel" and "beaten"/"geschlagen" from SRC and REF, changing the meaning and context of the sentence.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	einem → vor → einem  	den → die → die  	Hilfe → Unterstützung → Unterstützung  	Schlüsselstaaten → wichtigen → wichtigen
blamed → schuldigte → Schuld  	giving → gab → Medienschelte  	dressing-down → Abwärtsverfahren → Medienschelte
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In this case, "schwanken" (HYP) and "wackeln" (REF) are both suitable translations for "wavering." Both words convey a similar meaning, indicating minor synonym variation rather than a mistranslation.
sitz → Sitz → Bank
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	Konkurrentin → Wettbewerber → Konkurrentin
1. Trump → Trumpen → Trump  	2. Organe → Institute → Institute  		**Explanation:** "Trumpen" in HYP is an incorrect form of "Trump" from SRC/REF. "Organe" in HYP should be "Institute," as it better captures the intended meaning in the context of polls or organizations referred to in SRC/REF.
No translation errors detected.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump
1. **go on → machen → machen (contextual error)**		**Explanation:** The phrase "go on a holiday" is commonly rendered into German as "in den Urlaub gehen," but in this context, the action is conveyed as "machen," which, while grammatically acceptable, may not accurately reflect the intended idiomatic expression of "going on a holiday."		**Note:** Although "machen" is present in both HYP and REF, the critical aspect here is the context of "go on" (SRC), suggesting that the translation's contextual fidelity could be considered improved even though both translations settle linguistically on "machen." If the task goal focuses on rigid SRC-REF juxtaposition without offering a syntactical reinterpretation, any potential contextual nuance would be acknowledged but declared stylistically marginal if the REF normalized it.	
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Considering the similarity between HYP and REF, there are no significant single-word translation errors. Both "die Wahrheit sagen" in HYP and "die Wahrheit zu erzählen" in REF effectively translate the phrase "telling the truth" from SRC. The distinction is more stylistic than erroneous.
he → er → ihn  	make → macht → reiche  	ok → hat → in Ordnung  	Trump → Trumpf → Trump  		**Explanation:**  	- "he" from SRC is mistranslated to "er" in HYP, whereas "ihn" in REF accurately reflects the context.  	- "make" is translated as "macht" in HYP, but "reiche" in REF better fits the original sentence's meaning.  	- "ok" is not present in HYP but is contextually translated as "in Ordnung" in REF, whereas "hat" is incorrect.  	- "Trump" is incorrectly translated as "Trumpf" in HYP, instead of just retaining "Trump" as in REF.
I'd return → habe zurückgekehrt → kehre zurück  		**Explanation:** "habe zurückgekehrt" is a mistranslation because it is not the correct form of the verb to convey the English "I'd return." In the context of the sentence, "kehre zurück" is the form used in REF, aligning better with the meaning in SRC.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both HYP and REF convey the meaning of the SRC sentence well. The variations are stylistic or synonymous rather than mistranslations.
Olympics → Olympische Spiele → Olympia  	Brazen → (Not translated) → Dreister  		**Explanation:** "Olympische Spiele" in HYP is a mistranslation when compared to "Olympia" in REF, altering the simplification present in REF. The word "Brazen" from SRC is not translated in HYP, while REF uses "Dreister," which correctly captures the sense of boldness accompanying the misconduct.
No translation errors detected.
Kenya's track and field athletes → Kenia → Kenias Leichtathleten  		**Explanation:** "Kenia" in HYP does not reflect the specific focus on "Kenya's track and field athletes" from SRC/REF, leading to a significant contextual omission of detail present in REF.
attainment → Bushaus → Trainer
No translation errors detected.
announced → kündigte an → mitgeteilt  	coach → Bus → Coach  	runner → Trainers → Läufers  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Kündigte an" (announced) in HYP is a mistranslation here compared to "mitgeteilt" (communicated/informed) in REF, which fits the context better.	2. "Bus" (bus) in HYP is a clear mistranslation of "coach" in both SRC and REF.	3. "Trainers" (trainer) in HYP is incorrectly used, whereas REF correctly uses "Läufers" (runner), fitting the original phrase's context more precisely.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence "Kenias Teammanager wurden von den Dopingbeamten darüber informiert." conveys the same meaning as the SRC sentence, and aligns with the REF sentence meaning. There are no single-word errors that significantly change the meaning.
IAAF → IAF → IAAF  	Föderation → aufstellen → mit (contextually "stated")
IAAF → IAF → IAAF  		**Explanation:** "IAAF" in SRC and REF is mistranslated as "IAF" in HYP, which changes the specific organization mentioned.
1. went → besuchte → ist gegangen  	2. alleged → behauptete → hat sich ausgegeben  	3. handed → in der ausgehändigt → abgegeben  	4. Kenias Chef der De-Mission → Kenias Chef de Mission → Chef de Mission Stephan Arap Soi  		**Explanation:**  	- "besuchte" (visited) is a mistranslation of "went" (ist gegangen).	- "behauptete" (claimed) is a mistranslation of "alleged" in the context of impersonation ("hat sich ausgegeben").	- "in der Stichprobe ausgehändigt" does not properly translate "handed in the sample" ("abgegeben" in REF denotes 'submitted' in this context).	- "Kenias Chef der De-Mission" does not accurately reflect "Chef de Mission Stephan Arap Soi" from REF.
He → Die → Er  	athlete's → des Sportlers → des Athleten  	training → Schulung → Trainings  	World Anti-Doping Agency → Internationalen Antidoping-Agentur → Welt-Anti-Doping-Agentur
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence is a correct translation of the SRC sentence despite slightly different word choices compared to REF. The meaning is preserved without significant mistranslations.
Michael Rotch → Michael Rotich → Michael Rotich
alleged → Angeblich → soll  	sportspeople → Sportlern → Sportler  		**Explanation:** "Angeblich" translates to "allegedly," which is less clear than "soll" in this context. "Sportlern" (plural dativ) mismatches with "sportspeople" as "Sportler" (plural nominativ/akkusativ) fits better in the sentence context, aligning with the simpler term used in the REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence appropriately translates each word from the SRC sentence and aligns well, meaning-wise, with the REF sentence. There is no single-word mistranslation that significantly alters the meaning.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation conveys the same meaning as the SRC and closely resembles the REF. Words and phrases like "doping checks" (Dopingkontrollen), "announced" (ankündigte), "particularly closely" (besonders aufmerksam) have accurate counterparts in the HYP. Here, no single-word translation errors significantly affecting the meaning were detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP clearly communicates the meaning of the SRC sentence and aligns well with the REF. There is no single-word mistranslation that alters the meaning.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The translations convey the same meaning, with minor synonym variations that do not affect accuracy: "Olympischen Spiele" in HYP and "Olympia-Beginn" in REF both translate "the start of the Olympics" from SRC adequately.
WADA → WADA → WADA  	mit den Regeln der WADA → WADA → WADA  		**Explanation:** Both "WADA" and the phrase "mit den Regeln der WADA" appear correct when compared between HYP and REF translations. However, the REF phrase "mit den Regeln der WADA" actually corresponds exactly to "WADA rules" from SRC when compared with the HYP translation. Thus, no single-word mistranslation errors distinctly affecting the meaning are identified.		No translation errors detected.
Running → Führen → Läufer
track and field athletes → Spurensportler → Leichtathleten
claim → behauptet → Vorwürfe  	drugs → Dopingdrogen → Doping-Mittel  	mentality → man könne → Mentalität  	cheating → betrügen → Sportbetrugs  		**Explanation:**  	1. "behauptet" in HYP, meaning "claimed", deviates from "Vorwürfe" in REF, which means "accusations" or "allegations".	2. "Dopingdrogen" in HYP directly translates to "doping drugs", while "Doping-Mittel" in REF is a more neutral and suitable term meaning "doping substances" or "doping agents".	3. "man könne im Sport betrügen" in HYP (one can cheat in sports) differs from "Mentalität des Sportbetrugs" in REF, suggesting there is "a mentality of cheating at sport".	
Pound → Pund → Pound  	Sportlerschaft → Leichtathletik → Leichtathletik
investigation → Untersuchung → nachgewiesen  	doping → Doping → gedopt  	sport → Sport → Sportart  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence contains the words "Untersuchung," "Doping," and "Sport," which are mistranslations when compared with the REF sentence, where more contextually suitable words "nachgewiesen," "gedopt," and "Sportart" are used.
track and field → Spuren- und Feldsportler → Leichtathleten  	banned → verboten → ausgeschlossen  
No translation errors detected.
Shakespeare anniversary year → Jahr Shakespeare-Jahrestag → Shakespeare-Jahr  	is putting on → setzt → präsentieren  	tragic couple → tragisches Paar → tragischem Liebespaar  
surprise → überraschend → überraschende  		**Explanation:** "Überraschend" in HYP is a mistranslation of "surprise"/"überraschende" from SRC/REF when considering the context of the sentence.
musical → Musik → Musical  	gripped → gefischt → erobert  
Artistic → Musik → Musical  	childhood → Kindheit → Jugend  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Musik" in HYP is a mistranslation of "musical" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the context.  	2. "Kindheit" in HYP is a mistranslation of "childhood dream" from SRC/REF, as "Jugendtraum" (youth dream) is the correct translation.
Orchestra → Orchester → Orchestergraben  	Direktor → Direktor → Dirigenten  		**Explanation:** "Orchester" in HYP fails to capture the specific context of "orchestra pit", which is translated as "Orchestergraben" in REF. Additionally, "Direktor" in HYP is less contextually appropriate than "Dirigenten" in REF for translating "director" in this musical context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence, with minor differences aligning with nuances rather than significant errors.
melodies → Gefühlen → Melodie
Formel → Rezept → Rezept  	unseren → unser → unser  		**Explanation:** "Formel" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Rezept" from REF, and "unseren" is a less suitable translation compared to "unser" in terms of grammatical agreement with "Orchester."
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
remembers → mit Klugheit → mit Wehmut  	love affair → Liebesaffäre → Liebschaft
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The difference between "von" in HYP and "der" in REF is a minor discrepancy in prepositions, which does not significantly change the meaning or context of the sentence in German. Both adequately translate "of" from SRC.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "musikalisch ungewöhnlich" in HYP and "musikalisch außergewöhnlich" in REF adequately translate the phrase "musically unusual" from SRC, showing a minor synonym variation.
No translation errors detected.
feel → fühle → I feel  	witty → gut → witty  	bright → schön → bright  		**Explanation:**  	- "feel" should match the REF phrase "I feel," as it maintains the SRC's meaning more accurately.  	- "witty" is mistranslated as "gut"; it holds a different meaning in English that conveys cleverness, not just goodness.  	- "bright" is mistranslated as "schön" (beautiful) in HYP, which changes the meaning compared to the SRC context of "bright."
clever → Klugheit → klug  	naive → Naivität → naiv
like → stimmt → ähnelt  	personality → Persönlichkeit → Charakter  	as → als → den ich als  
singer → Opernsinger → Opernsängerin  	Künstler → Künstler → Künstlerin  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both HYP and REF accurately convey the meaning of the SRC sentence with respect to the main elements "honoured to work with her". The differences are stylistic and do not constitute mistranslations.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
conducting → Handeln → Dirigieren
No translation errors detected.
1. great → große → riesige  	2. experience → Erfahrungen → Erfahrung  		**Explanation:**  	- "große" in HYP is a mistranslation of "great"/"riesige" from SRC/REF, altering the level of emphasis.	- "Erfahrungen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "experience"/"Erfahrung" from SRC/REF, changing the number from singular to plural.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately captures the essence and relevant details of the SRC sentence, aligned with the REF translation, despite slight phrasing differences. There are no single-word errors that alter the meaning significantly.
director → Direktor → Regisseur
Puerto Ricans → Puerto Ricans → Puertorikaner
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation conveys the same meaning as the REF translation. While there are differences in word choice, such as "Fragen" in HYP versus "Themen" in REF, both appropriately translate "issues". Similarly, "damals so wichtig wie heute" in HYP adequately corresponds to "heute genauso aussagekräftig wie damals" in REF, maintaining the intended message.
Fifty-nine → Neun → 59  	work → Arbeit → Stück  
schoolgirl → Schülerin → Schulmädchen  	killed → (mistranslation omitted) → getötet
- schoolgirls → Schülern → Schulmädchen  	- ISIL → ISIL → IS  	- reportedly → [not translated in HYP] → Berichten zufolge  		**Explanation:**	- "Schülern" in HYP instead of "Schulmädchen" affects the meaning, as it loses the gender-specific reference to "schoolgirls."	- "ISIL" in HYP does not match "IS" used in REF, though contextually aligned, REF suggests a preference.	- "Reportedly" is not explicitly translated in HYP, resulting in an omission compared to the REF translation containing "Berichten zufolge."
Akunjee → Akujee → Akunjee  		**Explanation:** "Akujee" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Akunjee" from SRC/REF, which is a proper noun and should remain consistent. It significantly changes the accuracy of the name.
believed → wurde → wurde vermutet  	stronghold → Hochburg → Bollwerk  		**Explanation:** "wurde" in HYP is a mistranslation of "believed" which should be "wurde vermutet" from REF. "Hochburg" in HYP is a mistranslation of "stronghold" which should be "Bollwerk" from REF. These errors change the meaning and context significantly.
**(SRC word → HYP word → Correct REF word)**		1. flee → Flucht → verlassen
tombstone → Baustein → Mahnung  	testament → Beweis → Warnung  		**Explanation:** "Baustein" in HYP mistranslates "tombstone"/"Mahnung" from SRC/REF, and "Beweis" mistranslates "testament"/"Warnung". Both alter the intended meaning and context significantly.
flight → Flug → Flugzeug  		**Explanation:** "Flug" in HYP is used for "flight" but in the context of boarding, "Flugzeug" is the more appropriate translation.
married → verheiratete → geheiratet  	fighter → Kämpferin → Kämpfer  	an → eine → einen  	became → zum → zur  		**Explanation:**  	1. "verheiratete" in HYP is incorrectly used instead of "geheiratet" as per REF, denoting different grammatical structures in German.	2. "Kämpferin" in HYP is incorrectly referring to a female fighter, while "Kämpfer" in REF correctly aligns with the masculine form relevant in the context.	3. "eine" in HYP is incorrectly used for the masculine noun "Kämpfer"; "einen" in REF correctly changes the article to align with grammatical gender.	4. "zum" in HYP is inaccurately used; it should be "zur" as per REF, maintaining the consistency in forming "Widow" in German.
Reid → Ried → Reid  	nominee → Kandidatin → Kandidaten
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The single words within the HYP translation correctly translate the corresponding words in the SRC sentence, although there are some structural differences, these do not affect the comprehension or meaning substantially when comparing with the REF translation. The primary terms and entities are accurately translated without significant mistranslation.
Garland's → des Landes → Garlands  	nominiert → Nominierung → Nominierung (Note: This error was considered due to changing the context and part of speech from nominieren/nominating to Nominierung/nomination, though it is acceptable in some contexts based on sentence structure.)
Antonin Scalia → Antonin Scalia durch den Obersten Gerichtshof → Richter am Obersten Gericht
Thursday → Donnerstag → Donnerstag  	(Incorrect context rendering rather than a word-for-word error.)  		choose → wählen → auswählen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Thursday" is correctly translated as "Donnerstag" in both HYP and REF, although its placement in HYP may cause contextual confusion, it doesn't constitute a single-word error.  	2. "Pick" translates to "wählen" in HYP and "auswählen" in REF. Both mean "choose," but "auswählen" is more aligned contextually for this sentence.  	3. Additionally, "Clinton" is omitted in HYP, creating a contextual ambiguity, but this is not a single-word translation error per instruction emphasis on single words.	   	(Note: Given the focus on single-word translation errors, placement or missing words impacting context are noted but not the central focus unless they lead to definitive mistranslations within the task parameters.)
spekulieren → spekuliere → spekuliere		**Explanation:** In the HYP sentence, "spekulieren würde" is incorrectly translated when compared to the REF sentence's "spekuliere," significantly altering the sentence's structure.
rock the boat → rocken das Schiff → für Unruhe sorgen  	pick → Pfiff → Kandidaten  
chief → Hauptrichter → oberste  	U.S. Court of Appeals → Berufungsgerichts der USA → US Appellationsgericht  	District of Columbia Circuit → Bezirk Columbia Circuit → District of Columbia  
Reid → Raid → Reid  	minions → Minen → Lakaien  	enablers → Möglichkeiten → Helfershelfer
Trump → Trumpf → Donald Trump
says → sagen → will  	Treats → Verträge → Treats  	nude → Nuklearkalender → Nacktkalendar  	men → (missing in HYP) → Männer  		**Explanation:**  	- "says" is mistranslated as "sagen" in HYP, which should correspond to "will" in REF.  	- "Treats" is mistakenly translated as "Verträge" in HYP, which does not appear in REF.  	- "nude" is mistranslated as "Nuklearkalender" in HYP, instead of "Nacktkalendar" in REF.  	- The word "men" is omitted in HYP but present in REF as "Männer".
Treats → Trägermagazin → Treats  	starten → starten → herauszubringen
famous naked people → berühmter Nacken → berühmter nackter Menschen  	calendar → Zeitkalender → Kalendar  	Muses → Muss → Muses  		**Explanation:**  	- "Nacken" in HYP is mistranslated from "naked people"/"nackter Menschen". The error changes the meaning significantly.	- "Zeitkalender" is incorrect compared to "NU Muses Kalendar" where "calendar" is translated as "Kalendar" in the REF, keeping context and intent.	- "Muss" in HYP is a mistranslation for "Muses".
president → Bundespräsident → Chefredakteur  	nude-heavy → engstirnige → Nackt  	magazine → Zeitschrift → Magazin  	old-school → Altschulen → Oldschool  		**Explanation:** "Bundespräsident" in HYP translates to "Federal President," while the SRC context refers to "president" in the context of "editor/chief-editor" (Chefredakteur). "Engstirnige" meaning "narrow-minded" does not represent "nude-heavy," which is about the magazine's content focus, translated as "Nackt" in REF. "Zeitschrift" generally means "magazine," but in the context of SRC, "Magazin" would be more accurate. Lastly, "Altschulen" translates to "old schools," not "old-school" as intended in SRC, which is maintained in REF with "Oldschool."

No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** While there are differences in phrasing between HYP and REF, the essential meanings are preserved without any single-word errors that change the sentence's meaning contextually.
timeless → Zeit nehmen → zeitloser  	nudity → Nuancen → Nackheit  	conference → Tagung → Veröffentlichung
Kunststück → Kunstwerk  		**Explanation:** "Kunststück" in HYP is a mistranslation of "art"/"Kunstwerk" from SRC/REF. While both words are related to art, "Kunstwerk" is a more accurate representation of a "piece of art" in this context.
pics → Piks → Bilder  	calls → Anrufen → Aufruf  		**Explanation:**  	- "Piks" in HYP is a mistranslation of "pics"/"Bilder" from SRC/REF, as "Piks" is not a common or meaningful translation in context.  	- "Anrufen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "calls"/"Aufruf" from SRC/REF, changing the context significantly, as "Anrufen" implies phone calls rather than casting calls.
Kurdish → kurdische → Kurdische  	community → Gemeinschaft → Gemeinde  	mass exodus → Massenexodus → Massenflucht  
suitcase → Koffer → Koffern  		**Explanation:** "Koffer" in HYP is a mistranslation of "packed suitcase"/"gepackten Koffern" from SRC/REF, changing the expression and context significantly.
kurdische Gemeinschaft → Kurdische Gemeinde → Kurdische Gemeinde
No translation errors detected.
Rep → Rep → Recep  		**Explanation:** "Rep" in HYP appears to be a mistranslation or typographical error for "Recep," which is present correctly in SRC and REF. This is a notable error even though it may seem minor, as it is a proper noun.
Erdogan-Regime → Erdogan-Regime → das Erdogan-Regime  	antagniert → antagniert → bekämpft  		**Explanation:** Based on the context, there is a mistranslation:  	- "antagniert" in HYP does not fit contextually compared to "bekämpft" in REF, indicating a potential rough transliteration that doesn't match the nuance of "continues to antagonize" (implying active hostility or combating), which in German was effectively captured by "bekämpft."		Note: While mismatches such as "Vereinigung" and "Verband," or differences like "zehntausend" and "zehntausenden" are present, they don't significantly alter the meaning when considering both context and customary translations.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately translates the key concepts and intent of the SRC sentence when compared with the REF sentence. Although there are structural differences, there are no single-word translations that significantly change the meaning or context.
coup → Staatsstreich → Putsch  	added → gesetzt → hinzu  	ethnic → [missing] → ethnische  		**Explanation:** "Staatsstreich" in HYP doesn't fully translate the nuance of "Putsch" as used in REF. "gesetzt" in HYP doesn't capture the subtler meaning of "hinzu" from "added". The word "ethnic" in the SRC is entirely missing in the HYP translation, which is represented by "ethnische" in REF.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation appropriately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence when compared to the REF sentence, with no significant changes in the meaning related to specific single-word translation errors.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation adequately captures the main concepts from the SRC, despite differences in expression compared to REF. The reference translation (REF) expresses a slightly different nuance but still aligns contextually with the source.
No translation errors detected.
head → Vorsitzende → Verbandschef  	harshly → hart → scharf
**No translation errors detected.**  		**Explanation:** The words in the HYP sentence adequately express the meaning of the source sentence compared to the reference translation. The discrepancies, such as word placement or slight structural changes, do not result in a significant meaning change.
felt → fühlte → fühle  	for the first time → zum ersten Mal → zum ersten Mal  		**Explanation:** 	1. "felt" in the past tense in HYP is a mistranslation of the present perfect "have felt"/"fühle" in SRC/REF. 	2. The phrase "zum ersten Mal" meaning "for the first time" is placed incorrectly, changing the intended sense in the HYP sentence compared to SRC/REF. The placement in HYP suggests it's not the first time the speaker felt safe, which is incorrect.
Gülen → Gürlen → Gülen
No translation errors detected.
Gülen-supporter → Günlen-Fans → Gülen-Anhänger  	career-destroying → zerstört → vernichtet
1. change → ändern → anpasst  	2. packed → gefüllt → gepackten  		**Explanation:**  	- "ändern" in HYP does not adequately capture the contextual meaning of "change" compared to the suggested "anpasst" in REF.  	- "gefüllt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "packed", which properly translates to "gepackten" in REF, affecting the meaning concerning the content and state of the suitcase.
reports → Mitteilungen → berichtet  	coup → Staatsstreich → Putsch  	granted → gewährt hat → anerkannten  	from → von → der  		**Explanation:**  	- "Mitteilungen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "reports/berichtet" from SRC/REF, altering the meaning from "news report" to "notification or communication".	- "Staatsstreich" in HYP is a mistranslation of "coup/Putsch" from SRC/REF, though related, "Staatsstreich" refers more formally to a "state stroke".	- "gewährt hat" in HYP incorrectly mirrors the aiding context of "granted/anerkannten" from SRC/REF, by linguistically attributing the action of granting asylum directly to the group instead of recognizing them.	- "von" in HYP misplaces the agency contextually, translating "from/der" incorrectly, as it suggests Turks came from the coup rather than being pre-existing asylum beneficiaries.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence effectively captures the meaning and context of the SRC sentence, with numbers and percentages correctly translated. Any differences between HYP and REF are minor, such as wording choices, and do not constitute translation errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The terms in the HYP sentence accurately convey the meaning of the original SRC sentence, and no single-word mistranslations significant enough to change the meaning or context can be identified in comparison with the REF.
No translation errors detected.
Go → Geht → Dahin  	hurts → schmerzt → wehtut
1. Locals → Lokale → Einheimischen	2. elections → Sommerwahlen → Sommer-Wahlkampf	3. state → staatliche → Landtag		**Explanation:** "Lokale" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Locals"/"Einheimischen" from SRC/REF. "Sommerwahlen" in HYP does not accurately capture the nuance of "Sommer-Wahlkampf" in REF, and "state" is mismatched as "staatliche" instead of "Landtag" which means state parliament specifically.
No translation errors detected.
state parliament elections → Parlamentswahlen → Landtagswahl
1. state → Parlaments → Landtags  	2. elections → Wahlen → Wahlkampf  		**Explanation:**  	- "State parliament elections" should be translated to "Landtagswahlkampf," but in the Hypothesis, "Parlamentswahlen" was used, which alters the meaning.  	- The term "Wahlen" (elections) in HYP should correctly reflect the "Wahlkampf" (election campaign) from REF, offering a more specific context.
locals → Orte → Einheimischen  	won over → übernommen → überzeugt  
Usedom → Ussee → Usedom  	Staat → Land → Land
consider → berücksichtigen → kommen  	holidays → Ferien → Ferien  	volunteers → Freiwillige → Helfer  	put up → einlegten → aufhängen  	blow up → sprengen → aufblasen  	distribute → verteilen → verteilen  	votes → Stimmen → Stimmen  	end → Ende → Ende  	hard → schwer → nur mühevoll aufzutreiben
election → Wahl → Wahlkampf  		**Explanation:** In HYP, "Wahl" translates "election" from SRC, while in REF "Wahlkampf" (campaign) is used instead, altering the context.
heated → aufgeheizte → heiße
Sellering → Seller → Sellering  	Führer → Anführer → Anführer
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The translation in HYP aligns well with the SRC sentence's main idea and context. Minor discrepancies exist, but none significantly change the meaning when compared to REF.
Sellering → Verkauf → Sellering  	inconspicuous → unsichtbaren → unauffällig  
chatting → tauscht → plauscht  	legendarily → klammheimlicher → legendär  
No translation errors detected.
Her → ihre → ihre  	can manage it → wir können es schaffen → Wir schaffen das  	far-right → extremen Rechten → Rechtspopulisten  	  	**Explanation:** The phrase "can manage it" is inaccurately translated in HYP as "wir können es schaffen," which is a direct but not contextually equivalent translation compared to "Wir schaffen das" in REF. The translation of "far-right" in HYP as "extremen Rechten" is more specific, while REF uses "Rechtspopulisten," suggesting a broader context that includes but is not limited to the extreme right. Although both "extremen Rechten" and "Rechtspopulisten" could discuss the rise of far-right ideologies, the political nuance varies, marking it as a significant contextual discrepancy.
Lorenz → Lenz → Lorenz  	Caffier → Caffer → Caffier  		**Explanation:** "Lenz" and "Caffer" in HYP are mistranslations of "Lorenz"/"Lorenz" and "Caffier"/"Caffier" respectively from SRC/REF, altering the proper name significantly.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence and there are no significant single-word translation errors when compared to the REF sentence.
Right → Recht → stimmte  		**Explanation:** "Recht" in HYP is a mistranslation of "right"/"stimmte" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning.
majority → Mehrheit → Mehrheit  	federal states → Bundesstaaten → Bundesländer  	complained → beschwert → klagte  		**Explanation:** "Bundesstaaten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "federal states" as per SRC and should be "Bundesländer" in the given German context. "Beschwert" is a possible translation of "complained" but "klagte" directly corresponds to the REF translation and can indicate a sound translation choice.
No translation errors detected.
verzichtet → gibt → dispense/dropping	normalen → üblichen → normal/usual  	Parasols → Sonnenschirmen → parasols/umbrellas  	Ballons → Luftballons → balloons/balloons (contextual difference)  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "kleine Rolle" in HYP and "untergeordnete Rolle" in REF adequately translate the phrase "minor role" from SRC, showing acceptable variations in expression. All words in the HYP align with the intended meaning of the SRC as presented in the REF.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words in the HYP sentence, when compared to the SRC and REF, do not present any significant mistranslations that alter the overall meaning. Though there are slight wording differences and structural variations, the essential content and context are retained accurately.
advice → Ratschläge → Rat  	candidate → Kandidat → Wahlkämpfer  	competitors → Konkurrenten → Mitstreiter  	village fetes → Dorffets → Dorffeste  	Golden Wedding anniversaries → Golden Wedding Jubiläum → Goldene Hochzeiten  	birthday party → Geburtstag → Geburtstagsfeier  
Sellering → Verkäufe → Sellering  	called → bezeichnet → aufgerufen  		**Explanation:** "Verkäufe" in HYP translates to "Sales" in English, which is a mistranslation of "Sellering" from SRC/REF. Additionally, "bezeichnet" translates to "designated" or "denominated," which does not align with "called" from SRC and is incorrect in context compared to the REF "aufgerufen."
Sozialdemokraten → Sozialdemokraten → Sozialdemokraten		Only one word, "fractionally" in SRC, is translated as "einen Bruchteil" in HYP, which is not incorrect. The difference between "einen Bruchteil" (fractionally) and "knapp" (just) in REF is minor and does not represent a significant change in meaning.		No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The main entities and percentage values in both HYP and REF align with the SRC, and while there are some stylistic differences, there are no mistranslations that significantly impact the meaning.
Wahlbeteiligung → Umfragen → Umfragen
Urlaubsfrage → Ferien-Not → Ferien-Not
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence is a valid translation that captures the meaning and context of the SRC and sufficiently aligns with REF to not have any clear mistranslations in single words.
Apart → Im Übrigen → Ansonsten  	searching out → suchen → auf Spurensuche nach  	voters → Wähler → Stimmbürgern  	local → vor Ort → einheimischen
überquert → kurvt → kurvt  	nette → schön → schön  		**Explanation:** "Überquert" means "crossing," which is a more direct translation but doesn't contextually fit as well as "kurvt" in this instance. "Nette" translates to "nice," which is less suitable than "schön" in this context.
view → Ansicht → Eindruck  	bad → schlimm → Strafe
restaurants → Restaurants → Gaststätten  	closure → Schließung → Sperrung  
speed → Geschwindigkeit → Schnelligkeit  	redeveloped → entwickelt → saniert

No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
start → Anfang → Wochenanfang  	half-way → Mittelweg → Halbzeit  		**Explanation:**  	- "Anfang" in HYP mistranslates "start" from SRC; REF uses "Wochenanfang".  	- "Mittelweg" in HYP mistranslates "half-way" in SRC, where REF uses "Halbzeit", meaning "half-time", which fits the context better.
obligingness → Verpflichtung → Entgegenkommen  	construction → Bau → Bauarbeiten  
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
fewer → weniger → zurückzugehen  		**Explanation:** "weniger" in HYP translates to "fewer" in SRC but the REF uses "zurückzugehen," implying a reduction, aligning with the intended meaning better than the HYP.
1. serious → ernste → erhebliche  	2. redevelopment → Umstrukturierung → Sanierung  		**Explanation:** "Ernste" in HYP translates "serious" from SRC, but "erhebliche" is used in REF, which is more contextually accurate for "serious complaints" in this context. "Umstrukturierung" in HYP translates "redevelopment," but "Sanierung" is used in REF, indicating a different context or nuance intended by REF.
Bachsatzstraße → Bachtzstraße → Bachsatzstraße  	Personen → Menschen → Leute  	Satnav → Satnav → Navi  	Signal → Signal → Beschilderung
some → einige → mancher  	hurtling → gehen → verfranste  		**Explanation:** "Einige" in HYP is a less precise translation of "some"/"mancher" from SRC/REF, and "gehen" is a mistranslation that does not capture the intended action of "hurtling"/"verfranste."
commune → Kommune → Gemeinde  	increased → erhöht → forderte verstärkt  		**Explanation:** "Kommune" in HYP is a mistranslation of "commune"/"Gemeinde" from SRC/REF, and "erhöht" is a mistranslation of "increased"/"forderte verstärkt", altering the context and meaning of the sentence.
Erlauben Sie mir, die Übersetzungsfehler in der Kandidatübersetzung zu identifizieren:		King → König → King		**Erklärung:** "König" in HYP ist eine mistranslation von "King" vom SRC und REF, da es ein Eigenname ist und kein deutscher Titel. Sein beharrlicher Gebrauch als ein Name verändert erheblich nichts über den Satz hinaus.
**No translation errors detected.**  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation captures the meaning of the SRC sentence, with "zwei bis drei Fahrzeuge" matching the number "two to three vehicles," and "jede Minute" corresponding to "every minute." The use of "abgefahren" versus "geblitzt" is a minor synonym variation, both fitting contextually in the translation of a speed camera taking pictures of vehicles.
fastest → schnellsten → Schnellste  	was travelling → fahren → war
Voranschreiten → weitergezogen → weitergezogen  		**Explanation:** "Voranschreiten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "moved on"/"weitergezogen" from SRC/REF, which significantly alters the meaning.
that → die → dass
hand → Hand → Karten
1. questioned → in Frage stellen → fragt  	2. redevelopment → Umstrukturierung → Sanierung  	3. profits → Gewinnrückgang → Umsatzeinbrüchen
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation captures the meaning of the SRC sentence well, despite some variations in word choice compared to the REF. The key concepts of "some have been affected more than others" are accurately represented in the HYP sentence, and no single-word mistranslations significantly altering the meaning are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation adequately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence, and although there are differences in structure and word choice compared to the REF, there are no single-word translation errors that change the meaning significantly.
1. dealership → Autohändlerschaft → Autohaus  	2. passing trade → passivem Handel → Laufkundschaft  		**Explanation:**  	The word "dealership" is mistranslated as "Autohändlerschaft" in HYP, whereas the correct translation in the context is "Autohaus", as used in REF. Additionally, "passing trade" should be "Laufkundschaft" rather than "passivem Handel" to accurately convey the intended meaning related to casual customers.
Bars and restaurants → Lokale  	Straße → entlang
Göhner → Göger → Göhner  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Although the structure and wording of the HYP and REF sentences differ, the meaning conveyed by "it has threatened our very existence" in SRC is appropriately captured by both. "Sie bedroht unsere eigene Existenz" in HYP translates to "It threatens our very existence," which is semantically consistent with the intention in SRC. There is no clear mistranslation of a word or change in meaning that needs correction.
It's not just → Nicht nur er → Nicht nur ihn  	restaurants → Restaurants → Gaststätten  		**Explanation:** In the HYP sentence, "Nicht nur er" is not a correct translation for "It's not just him" because the object form "ihn" is required as in the REF. Additionally, "Restaurants" can be considered an acceptable translation but "Gaststätten" is a more contextually suitable word in the reference translation, indicating a stylistic preference.
Customers → Zöller → Kunden
profit → Gewinn → Umsatz  		**Explanation:** "Gewinn" in HYP is a mistranslation of "profit"/"Umsatz" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning significantly.
profits → Gewinne → Umsatzeinbußen  	slumped → zunichte gemacht werden → beziffert
Straßenverlagerung → Straßensanierung → Straßensanierung  	seine → seinen → seinen
let → abwandern lassen → entlassen
company → Unternehmen → Firma  	employees → Beschäftigten → Mitarbeitern  	politicians → Politiker → Politik  		**Explanation:** In the comparison between HYP and REF, the translations "Unternehmen" for "company," "Beschäftigten" for "employees," and "Politiker" for "politicians" are not incorrect but differ from the more contextually aligned translations "Firma," "Mitarbeiter," and "Politik" in the REF. Each choice here represents a shift in nuance or category that impacts the broader context.
Göhner → Göger → Göhner  	government's president → Regierungschef → Regierungspräsident
Göhner → Ältere → Göhner  	knows → kennen → weiß
complains → Beschwerden → Klagen  	Göhner → Göger → Göhner
all → schließlich → ist  	moved → beförderte → angesiedelt  	he → sich → er
regular → regulären → Stammgäste  	traffic system → Verkehrssystems → Verkehrsführung  	visit → besuchen → vorbeischauen  		**Explanation:**  	- "regulären" translates "regular" from SRC and differs from "Stammgäste" in REF, which better fits the context of established customers.	- "Verkehrssystems" translates "traffic system" from SRC but "Verkehrsführung" in REF better conveys the sense of traffic routing or management.	- "besuchen" conveys "visit" from SRC, but "vorbeischauen" in REF better fits the context of customers dropping by less frequently.
If → Wenn → Wenn  	you → Sie → man  	can't → nicht → nicht  	drive → verfahren → herfahren  	past → können → kann  	other → andere → woanders  	places → Orte →  	are → sind → ist es  	also → auch → auch  	nice → nett → schön  		**Identified Errors:**		drive → verfahren → herfahren  	places → Orte → [no translation but conceptually missing]  	nice → nett → schön  		**Explanation:** "Verfahren" in HYP is a mistranslation of "herfahren" from REF and "drive" from SRC, indicating a incorrect component of the action. "Orte" covers "places" which isn't wholly wrong, but the more nuanced error lies in the omission/misplacement of equivalently conceptual "woanders" or a phrase covering "other places" that was adapted to "somewhere else." The use of "nett" denotes a casual tone not accurately capturing the intended sentiment of "schön."
Göhner → Göger → Göhner  	regulars → Register → Stammklientel  	redevelopment → Wiederaufbauarbeiten → Sanierungsarbeiten
Göhner → Gärner → Göhner  	Clientele → Klientel → Kundschaft
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence translates the meaning of the SRC sentence effectively. Although there are differences in word choice relative to the REF sentence, such as "Terrorismusbekämpfung" in HYP versus "Terrorbekämpfung" in REF, these do not constitute significant errors. The meaning in context remains clear and consistent with the SRC sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence, and there are no significant single-word mistranslations when compared to the REF translation. Differences in phrasing between HYP and REF, such as "eine Reihe von Sicherheitsmaßnahmen" vs. "ein dickes Sicherheitspaket," do not indicate errors, as both translations effectively communicate the concept of "a host of security measures."
residential status → Aufenthaltsstatus → Duldungsstatus  	terrorism → Terrorismus → Terror  		**Explanation:** "Aufenthaltsstatus" in HYP is a mistranslation of "residential status"/"Duldungsstatus" from SRC/REF, and "Terrorismus" is different from the more general "Terror" in REF.
No translation errors detected.
Vermittler → Vermittler → Versöhner
reasonable → vernünftig → zumutbar  		**Explanation:** The word "vernünftig" in HYP is a mistranslation of "reasonable"/"zumutbar" from SRC/REF. It does not convey the same nuance as "zumutbar," which means "acceptable" or "tolerable," possibly altering the intended meaning.
not asking too much → verlangen → überfordern
Andere → Weitere → Andere  	Punkte → Fragen → Punkte  	innerhalb → in → innerhalb
No translation errors detected.
Ergebnisse → Ergebnissen → Ergebnissen  	erreichbaren → erzielbaren → erzielbaren  	Einigung → Konsens → Konsens  		**Explanation:** In the HYP, "Ergebnisse", "erreichbaren", and "Einigung" are mistranslations when compared to SRC and REF. "Ergebnissen" and "Ergebnissen", "erzielbaren" and "erzielbaren", "Konsens" and "Konsens" are the correct translations from the REF that align better with the context.
Ansbach → Anschbach → Ansbach  	gab → präsentiert → präsentiert  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Anschbach" in HYP is a misspelling of "Ansbach" which is correctly spelled in REF.	2. "gab" in HYP is a mistranslation; "bekannt gab" does not convey the same meaning as "präsentiert", which is used in REF and better fits the context of presenting conclusions in English ("announcing" in SRC).
No translation errors detected.
benannt → angekündigt → verkündet  	Behörde → Agentur → Sicherheitsbehörde  	Knacken → Aufdeckung → Knacken  		**Explanation:** 		- "bekannt" and "angekündigt" in HYP could be considered for discrepancies with "verkündet” and "angepeilt" from the REF; however, both could adequately convey the meaning from the SRC, indicating varied translation choices.	- "benannt" is used twice in HYP, which matches "announced" and "heralded" from SRC, but "verkündet" matches the nuanced meaning better. 	- "Agentur" in HYP is slightly different in context compared to "Behörde" in REF for "agency", though both indicate a governmental body. However, the phrase "Sicherheitsagentur" does not match "Sicherheitsbehörde" in REF fully, indicating a shift in meaning.	- "Aufdeckung" in HYP implies discovery, whereas "Knacken" in REF correlates better with "cracking" in SRC.
No translation errors detected.
demand → Forderung → Ruf
Werbung → Sympathiewerbung → Sympathiewerbung  	entfernen → abknöpfen → abknöpfen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Werbung" in HYP is mistranslated from "Sympathiewerbung" in REF, which is more specific and contextually significant.	2. "entfernen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "abknöpfen" in REF. Though both verbs suggest removal, "abknöpfen" contextually fits better in this legal/judicial scenario.

No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** All key semantic elements in the HYP translation align with the SRC and REF sentences, capturing the intended meaning without significant errors in word choice.
überprüfen → überprüfen → checken  	informieren → informieren → offenlegen  		**Explanation:**  	- "überprüfen lassen" (HYP) translates to "have checked", which is technically correct, but it differs in nuance from "checken lassen" (REF/allow to be checked). This is a subtlety but can contextually affect the instruction given to refugees. 	- "informieren" (HYP) means "inform", which is incorrect compared to "offenlegen" (REF/disclose), changing the meaning of what refugees are supposed to do with their social media accounts.
He wants to reduce tolerance → Er will die Toleranz gegenüber Menschen → Bei Duldungen für abgelehnte Asylbewerber will er manche noch schlechter stellen als bislang		**Explanation:** The phrase "He wants to reduce tolerance" in English does not match directly with "Er will die Toleranz gegenüber Menschen" in the HYP, while the REF expresses it as "Bei Duldungen für abgelehnte Asylbewerber will er manche noch schlechter stellen als bislang", which captures the intent differently, especially with implications regarding the treatment of asylum-seekers. The minor rendering differences in other parts do not change the meaning significantly.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence and aligns well with the REF translation, maintaining contextual accuracy.

No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "Darüber hinaus" in HYP adequately translates "In addition" from SRC, "sorgen sich" is consistent with "are worried," and all other words appropriately match their counterparts in the REF sentence based on context. Any discrepancies are minor and do not significantly change the meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although there are differences in wording between HYP and REF, both translations convey the overall meaning of the source sentence accurately from English to German, with no single-word translation errors significantly altering the meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence translates "domestic security has come to the fore to a huge extent" effectively, maintaining the same meaning as the REF sentence. The variations present are stylistic and do not constitute critical translation errors.

argument → Argument → Streit  	ideas-gathering → idealistisches → Ideen-Sammlung
trying → versucht → müht  	strike → finden → um  		**Explanation:**  	- "Versucht" in HYP is a mistranslation of "trying"/"müht" from SRC/REF.  	- "Finden" in HYP is a mistranslation of "strike"/"um" from SRC/REF, changing the intended action.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence.

dealt → geführt → befriedet  		**Explanation:** "Geführt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "dealt with"/"befriedet" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the intended meaning of addressing or settling discussions.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence conveys the same overall meaning as the SRC sentence, with no single-word mistranslations significantly altering the meaning compared to the REF. The differences observed are related to sentence structure, which is permissible if the meaning is maintained.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence agrees in main concepts with the SRC sentence compared to the REF sentence. Although phrasing differs, key terms like "burka", "Verbot", and "Verfassungsfragen" align adequately with the SRC meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence, and while there are variations in word choices between HYP and REF, they do not constitute clear mistranslations. "Machbar" (HYP) and "zumutbar" (REF) can both be seen as different interpretations of "achievable," fitting the context without significantly altering the intended meaning. Similarly, other components of the sentence align well with the REF and do not present distinct translation errors.
few → einiges → einige  	inside → drin → in it  	cause → sorgen → cause (for dispute)  		**Explanation:** "wenige" in HYP translates "few," which contrasts with "einiges" (some/few) in REF, which provides a broader sense. "inside" is translated as "drin," maintaining the general meaning but not matching the REF focus on potential problems ("sorgen" for causing).
The single-word translation errors identified are:  		use → nutzen → profilieren  	shape → formieren → profilieren  		**Explanation:**  	- "nutzen" in HYP translates "use" from SRC, but "profilieren" in REF more accurately reflects the intended meaning in the context of the sentence.  	- "formieren" in HYP translates "shape" from SRC, but "profilieren" in REF better conveys the intended meaning in the context.
1. Head → Chef → Parteichef  	2. showed → gezeigt → signalisiert  	3. discuss → diskutiert → reden  		**Explanation:**  	- "Chef" is used in HYP for "Head", but the REF uses "Parteichef", which more accurately captures the role in the context.  	- "gezeigt" in HYP translates "showed", but "signalisiert" in REF better reflects the signaling rather than demonstrating aspect implied in context.  	- "diskutiert" in HYP translates "discuss", while "reden" in REF may better convey the conversational aspect in context.
gets off lightly → geht auf die leichte Schulter → kommt glimpflich durch
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words "Zahl der weltweiten Lieferungen" in HYP and "Auslieferungszahlen weltweit" in REF both adequately translate "global delivery figures" from SRC, showing a minor structural variation but maintaining the overall meaning. The sentence remains contextually and semantically consistent with the source.
1. But → Aber → Doch  	2. things → die Dinge → es  	3. quite as rosy → nicht so rosig → rund  		**Explanation:** "Aber" can often be translated from "but," but in this context "Doch" fits better given the REF translation's implication, "die Dinge" doesn't match the meaning conveyed by "es" in REF. "Nicht so rosig" is a mistranslation of "rund" given the context, as "rund" implies smooth operation rather than simply "rosy".
recall → Rückruf → Rückrufaktion  	fuss → Bewegung gebracht → Wirbel  	term → Amtszeit → Begriff  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Despite the variation in phrasing between HYP and REF, there are no single-word errors in the HYP sentence that change the core meaning when compared to SRC. The words translate adequately within the given context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence adequately translates the meaning of the SRC sentence into German, maintaining the context and significant elements present in both SRC and REF translations.
**Translation Errors:**		suffered → gelitten → schwächelte  	announced → ankündigte → mitteilte  		**Explanation:**  	- "Gelitten" in HYP is not the best translation of "suffered" in the context and differs from "schwächelte" in REF.	- "Ankündigte" in HYP is an incorrect translation compared to "mitteilte" in REF, which more accurately captures "announced" in the context.
449,100 → 49 100 → 449100  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning and context of the SRC sentence compared to the REF translation. "Verkäufe" (sales), "%" (percent), "niedriger" (lower), and other key components align well with corresponding elements, and differences arise mainly from stylistic rather than semantic discrepancies.
No translation errors detected.
Head → Markenleiter → Markenvertriebschef  	blamed → verantwortlich → führte  	poor → schlechten → schwächeren  	figures → Zahlen → Zahlen  	loss → Verlust → weniger  		**Explanation:** Each pair points out a distinct mistranslation in the HYP sentence when compared to the REF sentence. "Head" is translated inaccurately as "Markenleiter" instead of "Markenvertriebschef". "Blamed" is rendered as "verantwortlich" instead of "führte". "Poor" is translated as "schlechten" instead of "schwächeren". "Loss" is translated as "Verlust" when "weniger" would be more appropriate in this context.
1. key → Schlüsselmärkten → Kernmärkten  	2. purchases → Einkäufen → Kaufzurückhaltung  		**Explanation:** "Schlüsselmärkten" in HYP is a less accurate translation of "key markets" compared to "Kernmärkten" in REF. "Einkäufen" in HYP translates "purchases," but the REF uses "Kaufzurückhaltung," which suggests a more nuanced expression related to "fewer purchases" as "buying restraint."
No translation errors detected.
emissions scandal → Emissionsskandal → Abgasaffäre  	in the red → rot → ein Minus zu Buche  		**Explanation:** "Emissionsskandal" in HYP is close but doesn't capture the nuance of "Abgasaffäre" as in REF. More critically, "rot" in HYP ("red" in English) does not convey the financial context of "in the red," which is captured by "ein Minus zu Buche" in REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence compared to the REF translation. The variations in word choice and structure do not result in significant mistranslations or change in meaning.
Saxony's own brand → niedersachische Marke → Hausmarke der Niedersachsen  	lightly → leichtfertig geworden → glimpflich  	amounting to → von → auf  		**Explanation:**   	1. "Saxony's own brand" in SRC is mistranslated as "niedersachische Marke" in HYP whereas in REF it is correctly translated as "Hausmarke der Niedersachsen."  	2. "Lightly" is mistranslated as "leichtfertig geworden" in HYP, while REF uses "glimpflich," which correctly conveys the intended meaning.  	3. "Amounting to" is translated as "von" in HYP, whereas it should be "auf" as in the REF for correct contextual accuracy.
Kapper → Kappler → Kappler  		**Explanation:** "Kapper" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Kappler" from both the SRC and REF, likely due to a typographical error.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence translates the meaning of the SRC sentence correctly and captures the key elements. The minor syntactic differences do not constitute significant mistranslations.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** There are no significant single-word mistranslations affecting the main meaning or context between HYP and REF when compared with the SRC. The translation effectively conveys the intended message.
modifying → Neuformulierung → Umrüstung  	refitting → Neuformulierung → Umbau  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Neuformulierung" wrongly represents both "modifying" and "refitting," instead of the correct terms "Umrüstung" and "Umbau," respectively. This affects the meaning in context.
Umrüstung → Veränderung → Umrüstung
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence effectively captures the meaning of the SRC sentence. While some minor wording differences exist between HYP and REF, they do not constitute significant translation errors in terms of meaning or context.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words in the HYP sentence, "Focus" berichtete, Volkswagen würde seinen deutschen Kunden dennoch eine Garantie für veränderte Dieselfahrzeuge bieten, adequately convey the meaning of the SRC sentence and align well with the REF sentence. The key terms and meanings are preserved across the translations, and there are no significant single-word mistranslations.

No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
Bundesverkehrsminister → Verkehrsminister → Federal Minister for Transport  	CSU → CDU → CDU  		**Explanation:** "Verkehrsminister" in HYP lacks the "Bundes-" prefix found in the REF, altering the meaning from "Federal Minister for Transport." Additionally, "CDU" in HYP is a mistranslation, as Alexander Dobrindt is associated with "CSU" in the REF.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence, and any differences with REF are minor or synonymous variations (e.g., "Motorleistung" vs. "Kraftfahrzeugleistung").
No translation errors detected.
Volkswagen believes → Volkswagen ist der Ansicht → Volkswagen sieht		motor damage → Kraftfahrzeugschäden → Motorschaden		workshop → Workshop → Werkstatt
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC in German. The terms used in the HYP (such as "Verbraucher" for "customers'" and "Emissionsskandal" for "emissions scandal") are suitable translations, even if they differ slightly from the REF. Variations mainly pertain to style rather than meaning changes.
No translation errors detected.
Raffeisene-Bank → Raiffeisenbank  	fordern → verlangen  	zweite → zweites  	sein → Institut  		**Explanation:**  	- "Raffeisene-Bank" in HYP is a misspelling compared to both SRC's "Raffeisen Bank" and REF's "Raiffeisenbank".	- "fordern" in HYP does not accurately convey the meaning of "demand" as "verlangen" in REF.	- "zweite" in HYP should match the noun's gender and form as "zweites" in REF.	- "sein" in HYP does not correspond to "Institut" in REF, indicating a more specific part of phrase context.
Managing Director → geschäftsführende Direktor → Bankchef  	current accounts or day-to-day accounts → laufenden Konten oder Konten → Giro- oder Tagesgeldkonten
1. German Banks → deutschen Banken → Deutscher Banken	2. worry → Sorgen → befürchten	3. hit with penalty → belastet → zahlen		**Explanation:**		1. "German Banks": The correct translation from SRC should be "Deutscher Banken" not "deutschen Banken".	2. "worry": In the context of the sentence, "Sorgen" in HYP doesn't match "befürchten" in REF, which is a more appropriate translation.	3. "hit with penalty interest": "belastet" does not convey the exact meaning of "zahlen" in the context of paying penalty interest.
No translation errors detected.
Raffeisen → Raiffeisen
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The key terms and numbers in HYP match the source and reference accurately, with no significant mistranslation. The word "kostenlos" in HYP and "frei" in REF both convey the idea of "free" in this context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The key phrases in HYP correctly translate the primary components of the SRC sentence, and any differences between HYP and REF do not significantly alter the overall meaning or context.
For → Seit → Er  	withdrawn → zurückgenommen → abgehoben
money → Geld → die   	account → Konto → Konto   	costing → kostete → verursachen   		**Explanation:**		1. "money" from SRC is translated as "Geld" in HYP but should be interpreted as "die" in the context given in REF.	2. "account" remains "Konto" in both HYP and REF, which aligns correctly with the source word.	3. "costing" was translated as "kostete" in HYP, changing the tense and meaning towards a past occurrence. The REF stays closer to the continuous present impact with "verursachen."
cannot → kann → kann nicht		hinlegen → zur Verfügung stellen → hinlegen
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The translation in HYP conveys the same meaning as the source and is consistent with the REF. The differences are largely structural and do not involve relevant single-word translation errors.
cash → Geld → Bargeld  	safe → Sicherheitsbank → Tresoren  	raids → Razzien → Überfälle  	fifth → Fünftel → fünften  		**Explanation:**  	- "Geld" in HYP is a less precise translation compared to "Bargeld" in REF, which better conveys "cash" in this context.  	- "Sicherheitsbank" in HYP is a mistranslation of "safe"; the correct term "Tresoren" is found in REF, indicating where cash is stored securely, not referring to a bank.  	- "Razzien" in HYP refers to police raids whereas "Überfälle" in REF correctly translates the context of bank raids or robberies.  	- "Fünftel" in HYP is a significant mistranslation, as it means "one-fifth," rather than "fifth" as in "the fifth raid," which is correctly translated as "fünften" in REF.
Verständnis → verstanden → Verständnis  	Anlageformen → Investitionsformen → Anlageformen  		**Explanation:**  	1. **Verständnis → verstanden → Verständnis**: The HYP uses "verstanden" which means "understood," while the REF uses "Verständnis," meaning "understanding." Given the context, "Verständnis" better matches "understanding" in the SRC.	2. **Anlageformen → Investitionsformen → Anlageformen**: The correct translation is "Anlageformen" as per REF, since "Investitionsformen" changes the nuance and specificity somewhat from the original meaning found in the SRC.
No translation errors detected.
Federation → Verband → Genossenschaftsverband  	Cooperatives → Genossenschaften → Genossenschaftsverband  	Bavaria → Bayern → Bayern (contextualized differently but correct localization)  	ECG → EVG → EZB  	monetary policy → Währungspolitik → geldpolitische  	incurring → führt → verursacht  		**Explanation:** Each mistranslation changes or fails to capture the intended meaning, especially concerning the critical terms such as "ECG"/"EZB" which denote different entities.
No translation errors detected.
result → Ergebnis → deshalb  	accounts → Rechnungsführung → Kontoführung  
1. Altenburgerland → Altenburger Land → Altenburger Land  	2. Skatban-Zweig → Skatbank-Filiale → Skatbank-Filiale  	3. Investitionszinsen → Strafzinsen → Strafzinsen
managing director → Leiter → Hauptgeschäftsführer  	banking association → Bankverband → Bankenverband  	pay fees → Gebühren zahlen → Entgelte bezahlen  	investments → Investitionen → Einlagen
Tgernsee → Tegernsee → Tegernsee  		**Explanation:** "Tgernsee" in HYP is a mistranslation (misspelling) of "Tegernsee" present in SRC and REF, being an incorrect reference.
Geld → ihr → sie
Gmund → [Missing] → Gmund		**Explanation:** The word "Gmund" from the SRC/REF is missing in the HYP sentence, which is a significant omission affecting the translation's accuracy and completeness.
actors → Akteure → Schauspieler  		**Explanation:** "Akteure" in the HYP is a mistranslation of "actors"/"Schauspieler" from SRC/REF. It changes the specific meaning, as "Akteure" can suggest participants or agents, not necessarily actors.
Ernst → Sprecherin → Sprecher  	Privatkunden → - → Einlagen von Privatkunden  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Ernst" in SRC is a "Spokesperson," not specifically a "Sprecherin" (female spokesperson), as indicated in the HYP, whereas REF uses "Sprecher".  	2. "Privatkunden" in HYP does not align precisely with "Einlagen von Privatkunden" as mentioned in REF, indicating a more specific context for private deposits rather than direct reference to customers.
Schwellenwert → Schwelle → Schwelle  	Umsteigen → ins Negative zu gehen → ins Negative zu gehen  	Roten → Negative → Negative  	von → gegenüber → gegenüber  		**Explanation:** "Schwellenwert" in HYP translates to "threshold value," whereas "Schwelle" in REF means "threshold," creating a contextual discrepancy. "Umsteigen" is a mistranslation as it means "switch," whereas "ins Negative zu gehen" refers to "going negative." "Roten" means "red," a direct translation that doesn't fit the idiomatic context, while "Negative" is correct. The preposition "von" in HYP doesn't match the intended meaning of "regarding" or "towards" expressed by "gegenüber" in REF.
Competition → Wettbewerb → Konkurrenz  	move to → ziehen → Abwanderung von  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation retains the meaning of the SRC and aligns well with the REF translation, with no single-word errors altering the overall context or meaning significantly.
Vinyl → Viehziel → Platten  	records → Aufzeichnungen → Schallplatten  
lonely → Lediglich → Einsame  	men → Menschen → Männer  	vinyl → Lebenslauf → Platten  
Before you → (No error, both translations start appropriately)  	rush → (No error, both translations capture the idea of hastening or hurrying)  	to → (No error, both translations imply an action following)  	litter → eilen → Übersäen  	comments → Kommentare → Kommentarteil  	section → (No error, implied in the German translations)  	with → (No error, both translations use appropriate prepositions)  	gnarly → starken → rauen  	insults → Beleidigungen → Beleidigungen  	under → unter → unter  	the → der → dem  	pseudonym → Pseudonym → Pseudonym  	NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen → NollonelyMiddleageden → NichtAlleEinsamenMännerMittlerenAlters  	, → (No error, both translations handle punctuation appropriately)  	this → diese → diese  	statement → Aussage → Aussage  	derives from → geht aus → leitet sich von  	actual → realen → aktuellen  	data → Daten hervor → Daten ab  		**Translation Errors:**		1. litter → eilen → Übersäen  	2. gnarly → starken → rauen  	3. NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen → NollonelyMiddleageden → NichtAlleEinsamenMännerMittlerenAlters  		**Explanation:**  	- "eilen" means "to rush" instead of "to litter," which changes the action intended.	- "starken" means "strong" instead of "gnarly," altering the impact of the insults.	- "NollonelyMiddleageden" is an improper translation of "NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen," which should be rendered as in the REF.
millennials → Jahrtausenden → Millennials  	record → Rekordwiederaufflammen → Wiederaufstehung von Schallplatten
vinyl album → Kalbum → Platte
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Each word in the HYP sentence closely aligns with the meaning and context of both the SRC and REF sentences, with no significant mistranslations evident.
hoarding → Hobbyismus → Hobbysammlern  	vinyl → Weinkäufer → Plattenkäufer  	feelings → sich selbst zu fühlen → ihre Gefühle  	being alone → einen Alleingang → alleine Zeit zu verbringen  
No translation errors detected.
befleckten → geschäftigen → busy  	hingegangen → laufe → walked  	wildwütig gestrickt habe → wild gestuliere → gesturing wildly  	aufhöre → stehenbleibe → stopping  	Gutes → Bestimmendes → authoritative  	schauen Sie sich an → lassen Sie uns einen näheren Blick darauf werfen → take a look  	
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation adequately communicates the meaning of the source sentence, using slightly different but acceptable phrasing compared to the reference translation. There are no single-word mistranslations that significantly alter the meaning.
hotels → Hotels → Hotels  	Eats → Essen → Restaurants  	Prets → Prets →  	Paperchases → Paperkasse → Büros  	independent sellers → unabhängigen Verkäufern → unabhängige Verkäufer  	fantastic specialist record shops → phantastischer Fachrekordläden → fantastischer Plattenspezialgeschäfte  		**Explanation:**  	- "Eats" in SRC is translated to "Essen" in HYP, while "Restaurants" is used in REF, and "Restaurants" is the more contextually appropriate term.	- "Paperchases" translates to "Paperkasse" in HYP, but "Büros" is used in REF and appropriately matches the intended meaning.	- "independent sellers" translates as "unabhängigen Verkäufern" in HYP but was expressed in a simpler form in the REF with "unabhängige Verkäufer."	- "fantastic specialist record shops" translates to "phantastischer Fachrekordläden" in HYP, while the REF uses "fantastischer Plattenspezialgeschäfte," which is more accurate in context.		Note: "Prets" remained ambiguous in both HYP and REF, indicating a possible proper noun or brand name, so it was not marked as an error.
stop → nicht länger in den nächsten Teil zu rollen → auszuschalten  	emotional disposition → emotionale Disposition → Gemüt  		**Explanation:**  	1. **"stop"** is mistranslated in the HYP as "nicht länger in den nächsten Teil zu rollen" which is convoluted and incorrect. The REF uses "auszuschalten," which directly translates to "to switch off" or "stop," fitting the context better.	   	2. **"emotional disposition"** is translated in the HYP as "emotionale Disposition," which is directly translated but does not fit the more natural "Gemüt" in the REF given the context.
1. Glaswegian → Glasgowian → Stuart aus Glasgow	2. Ster → Sister → Sister	3. intellekten → Reckless → Reckless	4. ermöglicht → geht durch → geht durch	5. zu unden → zu füllen → zu füllen		**Explanation:**  	- "Glaswegian" was translated to "Glasgowian," which is a stylistic variance; however, the REF uses "Stuart aus Glasgow," reflecting a more direct translation from the English context.	- "Ster" is a mistranslation of "Sister," a proper name, and should remain unchanged.	- "Intellekten" is an incorrect translation of "Reckless," which is a proper noun and should not be altered.	- "Ermöglicht" (enables) does not convey the intended meaning of "goes through," which fits the context in both SRC and REF.	- "Zu unden" is a mistranslation lacking clear meaning in the context of filling time ("to fill").

His → Sein → Der  	single → Einzelne → Singles  	records → Rekorde → Platten  	repurchase → wiederkaufen → erneut kaufen  
get → bekomme → kaufe  	stuff → Dinge → Dinge  	came out → herauskristallisiert haben → erschienen  		**Explanation:**  	- "get" in the SRC refers to acquiring or buying, and in REF it is translated as "kaufe" (buy), but in HYP it is "bekomme" (receive), which shifts the nuance slightly.	- "stuff" has been translated as "Vieles" in HYP, whereas "Dinge" fits better with the REF "Dinge" for "stuff" or physical items.	- "came out" in context refers to things that were released or appeared, accurately captured by "erschienen" in REF, whereas "herauskristallisiert haben" in HYP implies a process of crystallization or becoming clear, which is not contextually appropriate here.
records → Aufzeichnungen → Platten  	introverts who like their own company → diejenigen sind, die ihr eigenes Unternehmen mögen → introvertiert sind und gerne alleine Zeit verbringen
vice → Leib → Laster  		**Explanation:** "Leib" in HYP mistranslates "vice" from SRC. REF uses "Laster," which correctly translates to "vice."
Wez → Nun → Wez  	arbeiten → arbeiten → arbeitet  	Yougow → Yougow → YouGov  
1. **Rekorde → Platten → Platten** 		**Explanation:** "Rekorde" in HYP is a mistranslation of "records"/"Platten" from SRC/REF, referring to physical media like vinyl records rather than achievements or results.
No translation errors detected.
vinyl → Winz → Platten  	records → Unterlagen → Platten  		**Explanation:** "Winz" in HYP is a mistranslation of "vinyl"/"Platten" from SRC/REF, and "Unterlagen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "records"/"Platten" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning.
explain → erklärt → erklären  	vinyl revivalists → Rebellen → Anhängern des Plattenrevivals  		**Explanation:** "Erklärt" should be the correct form "erklären" to match the REF translation. "Rebellen" is an incorrect translation of "vinyl revivalists"; the correct context refers to "Anhängern des Plattenrevivals," meaning followers or enthusiasts of the vinyl revival.
alleged → angebliche → angeblichen  	records → Unterlagen → Platten  
record stores → Rekordlager → Plattengeschäfte  	likeminded types → ähnlicher Arten → Gleichgesinnten
umbridge → blamiert → Anstoß
vinyl → Rebellenfans → Plattenfans  	overwhelmed → überrannt → überwältigt  	record sleeve → Rekordschlag → Schallplattenhüllen  	halcyon → halzyonische → glückliche  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation contains several errors in translating key concepts and emotions from the source and reference sentences, significantly altering the intended meaning.
Lücke → Leere → Leere  	haben → sein → sein  		**Explanation:**  	- "Lücke" in HYP is a mistranslation of "void"/"Leere" from SRC/REF, as it does not accurately convey the intended meaning.  	- "haben" in HYP does not accurately match "sein" in the context and structure of the sentence, potentially altering the overall meaning.
No translation errors detected.
headspace → Hauptraum → geistig
stack → Reihe → Plattenstapel  	pipes up → heraufbeschwören → flötet  
ICM → ICM-Umfrage → Umfrage des ICM  	vinyl album → Weinalbum → Platte
poll → Umfrage → Umfrage  	turntable → Tafel → Plattenspieler  	purchase → Erwerber → kaufen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Tafel" in HYP is a mistranslation of "turntable"/"Plattenspieler" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning and context.	2. "Erwerber" in HYP is a mistranslation of "purchase"/"kaufen" from SRC/REF, altering the grammatical structure and meaning.	3. There is no error in translating "poll" as "Umfrage" since the meanings align in both HYP and REF.
report → Beschwerden → Berichts  	concerned → schauen → aussehen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Beschwerden" in HYP translates to "complaints" instead of "report"/"Berichts" from SRC/REF.  	- "schauen" in HYP translates to "look" but implies visually observing the "stack," unlike "aussehen," which suggests the speaker's concerned appearance.
trophy → trophische → Trophäenaspekt  	Sounds of the Universe → Sonnen der Universe → Sounds of the Universe  	midde-aged → mittelalterliche → mittleren Alters  
record player → Rekordspieler → Plattenspieler  	Radiohead → Radiokopf → Radiohead  	record → Liste → Schallplatte  	stellen → stecken → stellen
No translation errors detected.
product → Produkte → produktlastig  	music → Musik → musiklastig  		**Explanation:** In this context, "product side" and "music" in SRC are translated as "produktlastig" and "musiklastig" in REF, indicating a focus or inclination rather than just the nouns "Produkte" and "Musik" in HYP. The translation in HYP loses the implied meaning of focus on a particular side.
We → Man → Wir  	people → (omitted in HYP) → Leute  	record → Rekordspieler → Plattenspieler  
teens → zehn → Teenager
Fopp → Mopp → Fopp  	vinyl → Weinbau → Schallplatten  	arrive → Ankunft → reingehe  
70s → 70er Jahren → um die 70  	taking → nehmen → machen
atmosphere → Atmosphäre → Atmosphäre  	stores → Lager → Geschäften  	noodling → ersticken → experimentellem  	speakers → Redner → Lautsprechern  		**Explanation:**  	- "Lager" in HYP is a mistranslation of "stores"/"Geschäften" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the context from physical shops to something inappropriate like storage facilities.  	- "Ersticken" misconstrues "noodling"/"experimentellem" in SRC/REF, incorrectly translating the musical improvisation or free-flowing nature of jazz as suffocating or stifling, which is inaccurate.  	- "Redner" in HYP refers to "speakers" as people, rather than "Lautsprechern", which clearly signifies the audio equipment as intended.  		The essence of the translation changes significantly with these errors.
psychological → psychologischer → psychische  		**Explanation:** "psychologischer" in HYP is a mistranslation of "psychological"/"psychische" from SRC/REF, which changes the context slightly, as "psychische" is more appropriate for this context.
minutes → Minuten → Minuten  	Fopp → Fopp → Geschäft  	records → Verkaufsdaten → Platten  		**Explanation:** The translation of "Fopp" as "Geschäft" in REF indicates that "Fopp" in HYP should be translated as a store or place. Additionally, "records" is mistranslated as "Verkaufsdaten" instead of "Platten," which conveys the correct meaning of music records in the context. No translation error for "minutes" as it aligns correctly.
She is → Sie ist → Sie macht  	window-shopping → Fenster Shopping → Schaufensterbummel  	on a spending spree → Ausgabenschlange → Großeinkauf
earn → verdient → verdient  	records → Unterlagen → Platten  		**Explanation:**  	The word "records" in the SRC should be translated to "Platten" when referring to music records, but it is mistranslated as "Unterlagen" in HYP, which refers to documents or files. The placement of "sagt sie" is a structural difference but does not affect the single-word errors. No error with "earn," "verdient" is correct.

In particular, words like "Demis-heiße Pflanzen," "verfolgen," "Teenagerkindern," "kreuzen," "vorsätzlich," and "Rekordspieler" these words in HYP are incorrect when contextualized with the SRC and translated REF.
stairwell → Durcheinander → Treppenhaus  	wall → Mauer → Wand  	records → Rekorde → Platten  	classes → Klassen → Musik  	records → Rekorde → Platten  		**Explanation:**  	- "Durcheinander" in HYP is a mistranslation of "stairwell"/"Treppenhaus" from SRC/REF, altering the meaning.	- "Mauer" in HYP is a mistranslation of "wall"/"Wand" from SRC/REF.	- "Rekorde" in HYP is a mistranslation of "records"/"Platten" from SRC/REF, which occurs twice in the sentence.	- "Klassen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "contemporary music and classics"/"Musik und Klassikern" from SRC/REF.
looking → schaut zu → sieht sie sich an  	decoration → Dekoration → rein dekorativ  	touch → angreifen → anfassen  		**Explanation:** 		1. "schaut zu" is a mistranslation of "looking" as compared to "sieht sie sich an" in REF, where the meaning is affected because "schaut zu" implies merely "watching" rather than "looking at something specific."		2. "Dekoration" omits the nuanced sense of "rein dekorativ" from REF, which aligns with "merely decoration" in SRC, emphasizing the sole decorative purpose.		3. "angreifen" is a mistranslation of "touch" when compared to "anfassen" in REF, where "angreifen" suggests a more aggressive action than intended by SRC and REF.
pure → reiner → reine  	art vinyl → Kunstvinyl → Plattenkunst
Bedenken → Attraktivität → Anbetracht  	Artikel → Gegenstände → Gegenstände  	beschwer → beschweren → beschweren  		**Explanation:**  	- "Attraktivität" in HYP should be "Anbetracht" based on the context provided by SRC and REF. The phrase should indicate 'given that' or 'in consideration of'.	- "Artikel" in HYP should align with "Gegenstände" from REF, staying consistent with "items" in SRC.	- "beschwer" in HYP should be "beschweren," as per both REF and German grammar.
demographic → Bevölkerungsentwicklung → Bevölkerungsgruppe  	vinyl → Weinbau → Platten  
But → Obwohl → Auch wenn  	discount → unerwähnt gelassen → unberücksichtigt  	record stores → Rekordlager → Plattengeschäften  		**Explanation:**  	- "Obwohl" in HYP is a mistranslation of the SRC conjunction "But" and should be "Auch wenn" according to REF.  	- "unerwähnt gelassen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "discount" from SRC. The correct word in REF is "unberücksichtigt."  	- "Rekordlager" in HYP is a mistranslation of "record stores" from SRC. The correct term given by REF is "Plattengeschäften."
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence adequately translates the meaning of SRC in comparison to REF, despite minor structural variation. All key concepts from SRC are preserved in HYP.
1. spending → sich drehen → Bummeln  	2. record shops → Rekordläden → Plattengeschäfte  	3. flicking through records → zu Rekorden zu flicken → durch Platten  	4. creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter → dreißigjährigen schleichenden Fernsehpräsidenten → unheimlichen, 30-jährigen falschen Moderator  	5. looming → hinwegsetzt → aufragt
longest-living → ältestes → am längsten lebende
Vertebrate → Wirbels → Wirbeltieren
female → Frau → Weibchen  	record → Rekordwerte → Rekord  		**Explanation:**  	- "Frau" in HYP is a mistranslation of "female"/"Weibchen" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning from an unspecified "woman" to a specific reference to the gender of the shark.	- "Rekordwerte" in HYP is a mistranslation of "record"/"Rekord" from SRC/REF, as it implies receiving "record values" rather than simply holding a "record."
court → Gericht → Gericht  	Jungle → Juncker → Dschungel  		**Explanation:**  	- "Juncker" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Jungle"/"Dschungel" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.  	- There is no error with "court" and "Gericht," as both are accurately translated in HYP and REF.
Jungle → Dschungel → Dschungel
**aufsichtsläden → Aufsicht → provisorische Geschäfte**  	**abschalten → knock down → niederzureißen**  	**Harikkürzungen → Harikkürzungen → Friseurdienstleistungen**  	**Grundmehle → Basic meals → einfache Mahlzeiten**  		**Explanation:**  	1. "aufsichtsläden" does not match "makeshift shops"/"provisorische Geschäfte".	2. "abschalten" translates incorrectly to "knock down"/"niederzureißen".	3. "Harikkürzungen" seems to be a mistranslated word compared to "haircuts"/"Friseurdienstleistungen".	4. "Grundmehle" does not correctly capture the "basic meals"/"einfache Mahlzeiten" meaning.
1. prefect's office → Büro des Präfekten → Präfektur  	2. represented → repräsentieren → darstellen würden  	3. sanitation risks → Sanitäreinrichtungen → Sanitätsrisiko
told → bezeichnet → mitgeteilt
argued → argumentierten → führten aus  	makeshift → Behelfsläden → provisorischen Geschäfte  	shelter → Unterkünfte → Unterkunft  	those in need → Bedürftige → Leute in Not
(Ausweisung → Führung → Ausweisung)  	(Bedenken → Sorge → Bedenken)  		**Explanation:** 	1. The HYP uses "Sorgen" (concerns) instead of the more precise "Bedenken" (concerns) from the REF. While "Sorgen" translates to "worries," in this context, "Bedenken" captures the intended meaning of "concerns" from the SRC better.	2. "Führen" (running) is accurate but can be contextually refined. Though there is no explicit single-word mistranslation associated with a significant shift in meaning, other vocabulary discrepancies in the context can lead to a nuanced difference potentially worth examining.  	3. The HYP word "Präfekten" does not directly match the SRC or REF translation of "Präfektur," showing a minor variation in meaning, but not requiring translation error identification as it still fits the overall context of "Calais prefect's concerns."
groceries → Gärtner → Lebensmittelgeschäfte  	cafes → Kabeln → Cafés  		**Explanation:** "Gärtner" and "Kabeln" in HYP are mistranslations of "groceries"/"Lebensmittelgeschäfte" and "cafes"/"Cafés" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** "Räume" in HYP and "Bereiche" in REF both adequately translate "spaces" from SRC without changing the meaning significantly. The rest of the sentence aligns well with REF.
Jungle → Junelle → Jungle  	Cafe → (omitted) → Café  		**Explanation:**  	- "Junelle" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Jungle" from SRC and REF.	- "Café" is omitted in HYP and should be present as per REF.
Kids' Café → Kinder → Kids' Café
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning and context of the SRC and corresponds well with the REF, with no single-word translation errors altering the intended message.
1. Jungle → Dschile → Dschungellager  	2. increase → Anstiegsrate → Zunahme  		**Explanation:**  	- "Dschile" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Jungle"/"Dschungellager," affecting accuracy.	- "Anstiegsrate" in HYP incorrectly translates "increase"/"Zunahme," which impacts the meaning.
No translation errors detected.
performance → Prozess → Auftritt  	time trial → Prozess → Zeitfahren  
1. "World Championship" → "Weltmeisterschaft" → "WM"  	2. "on Facebook" → "in Facebook" → "bei Facebook"  	3. "the 31-year-old" → "die 31 Jahre" → "der 31-Jährige"  	4. "ahead of his journey" → "vor seiner Heimreise" → "vor seiner Abreise"  		**Explanation:**	1. "Weltmeisterschaft" in HYP is technically correct but "WM" is more commonly used in the context of the sentence.	2. "in Facebook" in HYP is incorrect as "bei Facebook" better fits the context in German.	3. "die 31 Jahre" in HYP is not a correct translation, while "der 31-Jährige" is the correct form for "the 31-year-old".	4. "Heimreise" in HYP translates more to "journey home", which might not change the general meaning drastically, but "Abreise" is a more direct and accurate translation in this context.
1. explanation → Abendstunde → Erklärung  	2. Sugar Loaf Mountain → Zuckerloaf-Berg → Zuckerhut  
time → Zeit → Zeitfahren
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence adequately translates the key components of the SRC sentence and conveys the same meaning as the REF sentence. The main actions "reflect and analyse" are captured with "reflektieren und analysieren," and the concept of "debacle" is consistently translated as "Debakel." Though the HYP sentence follows a slightly different structure than REF, it still captures the essence of the original sentence without significant mistranslations.

Dreimonatsprobe → dreimalige → dreimalige  	Wechsels → Rennen → Zeitfahr  		**Explanation:** "Dreimonatsprobe" in HYP is a mistranslation of "three-time"/"dreimalige" in SRC/REF, and "Wechsels" is an incorrect translation of "time trial"/"Rennen" or "Zeitfahr" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the meaning and context.
1. misses → vermisst → verpasst  	2. semi-final → Halbfertigen → Halbfinale  		**Explanation:** "vermisst" in HYP translates to "misses" in the sense of longing for, not failing to reach, which changes the meaning compared to "verpasst" which correctly means failing to achieve or reach. "Halbfertigen" translates to "half-finished" instead of "semi-final", changing context and meaning compared to "Halbfinale".
Siegemunds → Siegeszug → Siegemund  	Erfolgsregel → Siegeszug → Siegeszug  	Viertel-Ende → Viertelfinale → Viertelfinale  	Halbal → Halbfinale → Halbfinale  	Tennistums → Tennisturniers → Tennisturniers

No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation adequately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence. Although there is a difference in phrasing compared to the REF, no single-word translation errors significantly change the meaning or are contextually inaccurate.
The following single-word translation errors were identified:		quarter-finals → vierteljährlichen → Viertelfinale		**Explanation:** "Vierteljährlichen" in the HYP is a mistranslation of "quarter-finals"/"Viertelfinale" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning.
There are several translation errors in the HYP sentence:		- German-German → deutsch-deutsches → deutsches Duo	- Olympic → Olympisches → olympischen	- semi-final → Halbial → Halbfinale		These errors are identified as significant because they change the context or meaning of the sentence. 		So, the corrections are:		- German-German → deutsch-deutsches → deutsches Duo	- Olympic → Olympisches → olympischen	- semi-final → Halbial → Halbfinale
Company → Firmengründungen → Konzern  	gets involved → omitted → steigt ein  	start-up → omitted → Start-up  	live → lebende → Live  	video game streaming → Videospiele → Videospielübertragungen

Spielriese → Spieleriese → Spieleriese
No translation errors detected.
advertising → Werbeindustrie → Werbeindustrie  	pricked up → gehalten → horcht  		**Explanation:**  "gehalten" in HYP is a mistranslation, changing the phrase "pricked up its ears" to "held in the ears," which does not preserve the idiomatic meaning present in both SRC and REF. The rest of the words in the sentence, including "advertising"/"Werbeindustrie", align properly between translations.
start-up → Unternehmensgründung → Start-ups  	California → California → kalifornischen  		**Explanation:** 	- "Unternehmensgründung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "start-up"/"Start-ups" from SRC/REF.	- "California" in HYP should be translated as "kalifornischen" as per REF to match the contextual usage in German.
No translation errors detected.
Xbox console → Absperrung von Xbox → Xbox-Konsole  		**Explanation:** "Absperrung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Xbox console"/"Xbox-Konsole" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.
market → Markt → Markt  	live-streaming → Lebensumfang → Live-Streamings  	video games → Videospiele → Videospielaktivitäten  		**Explanation:**		- "Lebensumfang" is a mistranslation of "live-streaming" from SRC and REF. In the context of video games, "Lebensumfang" does not fit, as it translates to "life span," which is incorrect. The REF correctly uses "Live-Streamings."	- "Videospiele" is a broad translation for "video games," but the REF specifies "Videospielaktivitäten" to capture the context of live-streaming activities, making the broader term slightly off in this specific context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately translates the meaning conveyed in the SRC sentence. The words "bekannten" and "bekannte" are contextually equivalent, and both render "well-known" appropriately in this context.
Einzelhändlern → Onlinehändler → Onlinehändler
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence "YouTube Gaming gehört dem Mutterunternehmen von Google Alphabet" correctly conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence in German, much like the REF sentence does. Both translations adequately reflect the ownership concept, and there are no significant mistranslations of any single word.

powered → betrieben → hochgefahren  	coupling → Anhänger → Anhängerkupplung  	move → verlegen → bewegen  
sinks → versinkt → abgesenkt  	exterior → Ausländern → Außenhülle  		**Explanation:** "Versinkt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "sinks"/"abgesenkt" from SRC/REF, and "Ausländern" is a mistranslation of "exterior"/"Außenhülle", both significantly altering the meaning and context.
speed → Geschwindigkeitskamera → Blitzer  	in-built → eingebaute → eine eingebaute  	alarm system → Warnsystem → Alarmanlage  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Geschwindigkeitskamera" in HYP is a mistranslation for "Blitzer" from the REF, indicating a specific type of speed camera more commonly referred to in German.	2. "eingebaute" lacks the article "eine" that is present in the REF ("eine eingebaute").	3. "Warnsystem" does not accurately translate "alarm system", which should be "Alarmanlage" as per the REF.
Vitronic → Vitronic → Angaben  	Anhänger → Anhänger → Trailer  	Bundesstaaten → Bundesstaaten → Bundesländern  		**Explanation:**		- "Vitronic" in HYP is a direct mistranslation since in the context it should be "Angaben" as per the REF, which translates to "according to" in English, reflecting the source's phrasing.	- "Anhänger" in HYP clearly does not match "Trailer" from the SRC and REF, which has been specifically translated as "Trailer" in the REF (used in German as well).	- "Bundesstaaten" in HYP does not correctly translate from "federal states" as compared to "Bundesländern" in the REF, which is more contextually fitting for describing regions within Germany.
authorities → Außenbehörden → ausländische Behörden
settle → anlegen → holt
Führung → Führung → Leistung  	Gipfel → Gipfel → Stadium  		**Explanation:** "Führung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "run"/"Leistung" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the context. "Gipfel" is a mistranslation of "Stadium"/"Stadium," compared to the SRC/REF context, changing the location meaning.
off-loading → Off-loading → Side-Stepping  	side-stepping → Nebenspiel → Side-Stepping  	support play → Unterstützung → Nachrücken  	running lines → Führung von Linien → Linienlauf  	brute strength → brutaler Stärke → roher Kraft  	olympic → olympische → Olympiamedaille

GB → BB → GB  	head coach → Kopftuch → Cheftrainer
GB → BIP → GB		**Explanation:** "BIP" in HYP is a mistranslation of "GB" from both SRC and REF, significantly altering the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation adequately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence, and there are no significant mistranslations when compared to the REF. Both "im" in HYP and "bei den" in REF are suitable translations for "at the" in the SRC context.
No translation errors detected.
hammering → Hin und Her → Schlappe  	startling → erschreckend → erstaunlich  
started → begonnen → begann  	tackles → Adressen → Angriffe  		**Explanation:** "Begonnen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "begann" from REF, and "Adressen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "tackles"/"Angriffe" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.
series → Reihe → (not present in REF)  	moving → Umsiedlungs→ fahrende  		**Explanation:**  	- "Series" in HYP is translated correctly as "Reihe," but the intended meaning aligns more with an action context of "running into moving buses" which does not require "series". The crucial mistranslation here is "moving" to "Umsiedlungs," which implies resettlement rather than motion or movement.	- There was a lack of a direct equivalent for "series" in REF, indicating a contextual difference rather than a precise word-level error. Thus, "series" matches with how "Reihe" doesn't fit the context, highlighting the translation's awkwardness.
minutes → Minuten (non-issue due to contextual translation accuracy)  	wing → Flügel → Ecke  	converted → umgebaut → umwandelte  		**Explanation:** "Flügel" in HYP is a less accurate translation of "down the right wing" compared to "Ecke" in REF, within the context. "Umgebaut" mistranslates "converted," changing the intended meaning, whereas "umwandelte" aligns correctly with SRC/REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The translation adequately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence with no significant change in context or meaning, and alternative phrasing between HYP and REF is minor.
Leone Nakarawa → Leone Nakarawa → Leone Nakarawa (Note: His name is correct in the translation)		beschlagnahmen → to seize → zu erzielen (to score)  		beraten → ein Drittel → ein drittes Tor  		verzögert → to postpone → aufgehalten  		**Explanation:**  	- **beschlagnahmen** (seize) incorrectly translates the concept of "scoring" in the context, which is implied as "ein drittes Tor zu erzielen" (to score a third goal/point) in REF.	- **ein Drittel** (a third) should be **ein drittes Tor** (a third goal/point) to fit the context given by REF.	- **verzögert** (delayed) incorrectly translates the context aimed at stopping or holding back, for which REF uses **aufgehalten** (held back/stopped). 		Overall, the mistranslations significantly alter the context concerning the sporting event described.
seven → in sieben Minuten → in der siebten Minute  	GB → der BB → GB  	17-0 → 0-17 → 0-17  	to the bad → zum Schlechten → für GB
restart → Anfang → Wiederanpfiff
tackling → GBB → Tacklings  	line → Grenze → Linie  	score → [omitted] → Tor  		**Explanation:**  	- "GBB" in HYP does not correctly translate "tackling" from SRC, whereas REF uses "Tacklings".  	- "Grenze" in HYP is a mistranslation of "line" from SRC, which should be "Linie" as in REF.  	- The concept of "scoring" a "goal" (Tor) in REF is omitted entirely in the HYP translation.
conversion → Umstellung → Umwandlung  	break → 20 Uhr → Pause
GB → BB → GB  		**Explanation:** "BB" in HYP is a mistranslation of "GB" from SRC/REF, altering the intended meaning and context.
No translation errors detected.
GB → BB → GB  	plugged → gestolpert → schloss  		**Explanation:**  	- "GB" is incorrectly translated to "BB" in the HYP.	- "plugged" is mistranslated as "gestolpert" instead of the correct "schloss" that aligns with sealing or closing a gap.

Boks → Bücher → Boks  	footwork → Fußballwerk → Fußarbeit  	line → Grenze → Linie  		**Explanation:**  	"Bücher" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Boks" from SRC/REF, which is a specific term referring to a rugby team nickname.  	"Fußballwerk" in HYP is a mistranslation of "footwork"/"Fußarbeit" from SRC/REF, altering the meaning.  	"Grenze" in HYP is a mistranslation of "line"/"Linie" from SRC/REF, which in sporting context means breaking through a defensive line.

Glover → ruhigen → Rudersieg  	cancer → Kraftomnibusverkehr → Krebs
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words in the HYP accurately reflect their meanings in the REF and the SRC. There are no meaningful translation errors or contextual mismatches present.
first → ersten Angriff → ersten Ruderschlag  	Höfe → Höfe → Hieve  	Heater → Heater → Heather  	im → im → am  		**Explanation:**  	1. "ersten Angriff" in HYP misinterprets the context, mistakenly translating "Erster Ruderschlag" ("first stroke") as "first attack," changing the meaning.	2. "Höfe" in HYP is a mistranslation of "hieve," referencing the rowing context; "Höfe" means "courtyards," irrelevant here.	3. "Heater" in HYP is a typo or misrecognition of the name "Heather" from SRC/REF.	4. "im" in HYP should be "am" to accurately specify the location, as seen in the REF. "Im Estacio da Lagoa" incorrectly translates the context compared to "am," meaning "at the Estacio da Lagoa."
1. pulling → Ohrfeige → am Ruder  	2. oars → Ohrfeige → Ruder  	3. coach → Bus → Trainers  	4. ever → jemals → allanwesend  	5. powered → anboten → ruderten  	6. pairs → Paares → Zweier ohne Steuerfrau  	7. scale → vergrößerten → legten  		**Explanation:** These specific words in HYP are mistranslations compared to SRC and REF, significantly altering the meaning and context of the sentence.
unbeaten → ungeschoren → ungeschlagener
What → Zwei → Was  	see → [missing in HYP] → sehen  	skating → kratzen → gleiten  	swans → Schwanen → Schwänen
rowing → ruhenden → Rudern  	coach → Kraftomnibusses → Trainer  		**Explanation:** "Ruhenden" in HYP is a mistranslation of "rowing"/"Rudern" from SRC/REF, and "Kraftomnibusses" is a mistranslation of "coach"/"Trainer". These words change the context and meaning of the sentence significantly.
touch and go → berührt und geht → riskant  		**Explanation:** The phrase "touch and go" has been translated literally into "berührt und geht" in the HYP, which does not capture the intended meaning "riskant" in the context provided by the SRC and REF.
bladder → Brotkrebs → Blasenkrebs
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation aligns contextually and conveys the intended meaning from the SRC, with no significant errors when compared with the REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "schlechte" in HYP and "schlimme" in REF adequately translate "bad" from SRC, showing a minor synonym variation. All other words align correctly within the context.
outlook → Prognose → Ausblick  		**Explanation:** "Prognose" in HYP is a mistranslation of "outlook"/"Ausblick" from SRC/REF, altering the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.
2014 → Saison → 2014
I → Ich → Ich  	needed → musste → benötigte  	get paid → bezahlt werden → Geld  	better → schneller → besser  	quickly → schneller → bald  		**Explanation:** "needed" is translated as "musste" in HYP, missing the nuance of "benötigte". "get paid" becomes "bezahlt werden" in HYP instead of "Geld" as in REF. "better" in HYP is rendered as "schneller", which changes the idea of improvement to speed, though the REF captures it as "besser". "quickly" is translated as "schneller", losing the sense of urgency toward the recovery from REF's "bald".
No translation errors detected.
ward → Warte → Station  	20ft → 200 → 20 Fuß  		**Explanation:** "Warte" in HYP mistranslates "ward"/"Station" from SRC/REF, altering the intended context. Additionally, "200" in HYP is incorrect for "20ft"/"20 Fuß" from SRC/REF, creating a numerical inaccuracy.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The translation in HYP "So fängt es an." is a valid translation of "That's how it starts off." in SRC and is contextually similar to the REF "So beginnt es." Both translations adequately convey the same meaning.
rowing → Rogen → Rudern  	journey → Reise → Herausforderung  		**Explanation:** "Rogen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "rowing"/"Rudern" from SRC/REF, and "Reise" in HYP is a mistranslation of "journey"/"Herausforderung" in SRC/REF, both significantly altering the meaning and context.
Nervenmorgen → nervenaufreibenden Morgen → nervenaufreibenden  	zerstreuen → verarbeiten → verarbeiten  
Stanning → Staning → Stanning  	Kapitän → Hauptmann → Hauptmann  	Reise → Einsatz → Einsatz  	Artillery → Artillery Regiment → Artillery Regiment  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP accurately follows the structure and meaning of the SRC and aligns well with the REF translation. There are no significant single-word errors affecting meaning or context.
It's → vor → Es  	been → war → waren  	back → vor → drei  		**Explanation:**  		1. "It's" in SRC is translated as "vor" in HYP instead of "Es" or an equivalent expression to fit the context.	2. "been" is translated as "war" in HYP instead of the plural auxiliary "waren" to match the SRC structure.	3. "back" is incorrectly translated as "vor" in HYP, instead of conveying the context of "drei" in REF correctly, which implies an ongoing period.
coach → Bus → Trainer
asked → verlangen → wünschen  	train → Zug → Trainieren  	coach → Bus → Trainer  
fünf → fünf → fünf  		No translation errors detected that significantly impact the meaning based on context provided.
punishing → Strafrhythmus → harten  	their → seine → ihre  	rivals → Rivalen → Gegner  
crews → Besatzungen → Teams
No translation errors detected.
Helen → Helsen → Helen  	bleibt → bleib → bleib  
hinreißen → mitreißen → mitreißen  		**Explanation:** "Hinreißen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "mitreißen" from REF. In this context, "hinreißen" and "mitreißen" can have slightly different connotations. "Mitreißen" more accurately captures the meaning of "carried away" as intended in the SRC sentence.
Start → Anfang → Start  	amazing → Erstaunliches → Tolles  
fireworks → Feuerwerkskörper → Feuerwerk  	row → Streit → Ergebnis  
No translation errors detected.
wedding → hier → Hochzeit  	to attend next month → im nächsten Monat → auf einer Hochzeit erscheinen
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While there are slight differences in wording ("Vorerst" vs. "Jetzt" and "diesen Augenblick" vs. "den Moment"), these variations do not constitute significant translation errors in the context of the sentence. The overall meaning is preserved in the HYP compared to the REF.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
champion → Verfechter → Olympiasiegerin  		**Explanation:** "Verfechter" in HYP is a mistranslation of "champion"/"Olympiasiegerin" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the meaning of being an Olympic champion.
I → es → ich  	stressed → betont → gestresst
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In this case, the HYP and REF translations convey the same meaning, despite slight differences in wording. The difference "so viel besser an" (REF) versus "viel besser" (HYP) does not constitute a mistranslation of the source sentence because the essential meaning is preserved, and no critical single-word mistranslation is evident.
Setting → geben → gesorgt
(Managing Director → Direktor → Geschäftsführer)  	(Veitensteingruppe → Vetensteingto → Veitensteingruppe)  	(Water Supply Association → Wasserversorgungsvereinigung → Wasserzweckverband)
Assocation → Assoziation → Verband
Franconian → französischer → fränkischer
association → Vereinigung → es  		**Explanation:** "Vereinigung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "association" from SRC which is referred to as "es" (implicitly referenced) in the REF. This changes the meaning and context of the translation. 
Later → später → später  	Water → Wasser → Wasser  	Forum → Forum → forum  	Government → Regierung → Regierung  	Lower Franconia → Niederfrankreich → Unterfranken  	Praised → lobte → würdigte  	Association → Verband → Zweckverband  		**Explanation:**		- **Lower Franconia → Niederfrankreich → Unterfranken:** "Niederfrankreich" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Lower Franconia," which should be "Unterfranken" as in REF.	- **Praised → lobte → würdigte:** "Lobte" in HYP is slightly different than "würdigte," which aligns with the more nuanced translation in REF, though it could be considered a minor discrepancy.	- **Association → Verband → Zweckverband:** "Verband" in HYP could be considered acceptable but lacks specificity compared to "Zweckverband" used in REF. However, the task instructs focusing on significant errors, so this might be considered contextually minor.		Given the task's emphasis on meaningful errors, the primary significant error is related to the geographical name discrepancy.

municipalities → Gemeinden → Städte  		**Explanation:** The word "municipalities" is mistranslated as "Gemeinden" in the HYP, whereas the correct translation in the context, according to the REF, should be "Städte".
**chairman → Vorsitzende → Vorsitzende**  	**mayoress → Bürgermeister → Bürgermeisterin**  	**Ruper → Ruper → Rupert**  	**Managing → Leitung → Geschäftsführer**  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Bürgermeister" in HYP is a mistranslation of "mayoress"/"Bürgermeisterin" from SRC/REF, changing the gender context of the title. 	2. "Ruper" in HYP is a misspelling of "Rupert," which aligns with both SRC and REF.	3. "Managing" translated as "Leitung" does not fully capture the specific role of "Geschäftsführer," which is used in REF.
No translation errors detected.
Frühlings → Brunnen → Brunnen  	gewachsenen → Hochbehälter → Hochbehälter  		**Explanation:**  	- "Frühlings" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Brunnen" from REF, which refers to "spring" as in "source of water" in this context, not the season.	- "gewachsenen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Hochbehälter" from REF, which refers to "elevated tanks" rather than "grown" (literal translation of "gewachsenen").
means → bedeutet → bedeute  	foodstuff → Nahrungsmittel → Lebensmittel  		**Explanation:** "Bedeutet" in HYP is correct for "means" from SRC/REF, so it's not an error. "Nahrungsmittel" in HYP is a translation error as it should be "Lebensmittel" to match the importance contextually as indicated in SRC/REF.
loyal → loyalen → treuen  	upstanding → aufhaltenden → korrekten    
1. Water Supply Association → Wasserversorgungsverband → Wasserzweckverband
Veitensteingruppe → Ventinsteing-Gruppe → Veitensteingruppe  	Niederfranconia → Unterfranken → Unterfranken  		**Explanation:**  	- "Ventinsteing-Gruppe" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Veitensteingruppe" from both SRC and REF, which have the correct spelling.	- "Niederfranconia" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Lower Franconia"/"Unterfranken" from SRC/REF, thereby not matching the geographical reference.
No translation errors detected.
water officer → Wasserbeamten → Wasserwart
He is a water officer, not "land" (alternative translation "boy/young man").   	loyal → Land → loyal    	lad → Knappe → lad
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** "Gemeinsam" in HYP and "Zusammen" in REF both adequately translate "Together" from SRC, showing a minor synonym variation. The rest of the sentence is an accurate translation.
1. spring → Frühjahrs → Brunnen  	2. Association → Assoziation → Zweckverband
challenge → Schieflage → Herausforderung  	pipe → Pipeline → Rohr  	elevated → gehobenen → Hochbehälter  	Kirchlauter → Kirchlauer → Kirchlauter  		**Explanation:**  	- "Schieflage" in HYP mistranslates "challenge"/"Herausforderung" from SRC/REF, altering the context.	- "Pipeline" in HYP is a mistranslation of "pipe"/"Rohr", which is more specific and contextually accurate in REF.	- "Gehobenen" in HYP inaccurately translates "elevated"/"Hochbehälter" from SRC/REF.	- "Kirchlauer" in HYP is a misspelling of "Kirchlauter" from SRC/REF.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation (HYP) uses different wording and structure compared to the reference (REF), but all the key elements from the source sentence seem to be correctly translated and preserved in meaning. The differences are minor and don't result in any significant mistranslation errors.
supply → Angebot → Versorgung  	spring → Frühjahr → Neubrunn  	elevated → gewachsene → Hochbehälter  	hosepipe → Hoffnung → Schläuchen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Angebot" (offer) in HYP is a mistranslation of "supply"/"Versorgung" from SRC/REF.  	2. "Frühjahr" (spring - as in season) in HYP is a mistranslation of "spring"/"Neubrunn" from SRC/REF, indicating a confusion between the meanings.  	3. "Gewachsene" (grown) in HYP does not reflect "elevated"/"Hochbehälter" from SRC/REF.  	4. "Hoffnung" (hope) in HYP is a mistranslation of "hosepipe"/"Schläuchen" from SRC/REF.
management → Verwaltung → Geschäftsführung  	passed → übertragen → übergeben  	who → dem → der  
Anna Netrebko is open → offen für → offen mit
Medicine → Arzneimittel → Medizin  	has come a long way → sind weit gekommen → hat große Fortschritte gemacht  	(44-year-old) → 44-jährige → 44-Jährige
diagnosed → diagnostiziert → erkannt
**Tiago → es → Tiago**  		**Explanation:** In the HYP, "es" is used, which incorrectly replaces "Tiago". The REF more appropriately uses context to keep Tiago as the subject.
**give → sagte → sang**  		**Explanation:** In the HYP sentence, "sagte" is a mistranslation of "sang" from the SRC and REF sentences, significantly changing the meaning and context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation adequately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence and matches the REF translation closely, with only minor stylistic variations that do not affect meaning significantly.
offspring → Nachwuchs → stammt  	bass-baritone → Bas-Barbarone → Bassbariton  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Despite the different word order and slight variation in translations of "now" (jetzt/nun), the HYP correctly translates the meaning of the SRC without significant errors.
Crime passionelle → Kriminalität → Beziehungstat  	partner → Partner → Lebensgefährtin
Partner → Partner → Partnerin  	Apartementsgebäude → Apartementsgebäude → Mehrfamilienhaus  		**Explanation:**  	- "Partner" in HYP is a mistranslation of "partner"/"Partnerin" from SRC/REF, as the gunshot victim is described as female in REF.  	- "Apartementsgebäude" in HYP is a mistranslation of "apartment building"/"Mehrfamilienhaus," with "Mehrfamilienhaus" being the correct and commonly used term for a multi-family residential building in German.
partner → Partner → Lebensgefährtin
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation adequately covers the meaning and context of the SRC sentence, despite stylistic differences with the REF translation. There are no single-word mistranslations significantly altering the meaning.
Suchen → Suche → (no direct translation error in REF, contextual variation)  	kann → könnte → könnte  		**Explanation:** "Suche" in HYP versus "Suchen" is more of contextual style difference than a single-word error. The more relevant single-word error is "kann" (HYP) which implies "can" compared to "might/could" which would align with "könnte" (REF).
1. muscular → muskularisch → muskulös  	2. sun-tanned → sonnenbesetzt → braungebrannt  	3. bald → böses → Glatze  		**Explanation:**  	- "Muskularisch" is not an accurate German translation for "muscular"; the correct word is "muskulös."	- "Sonnenbesetzt" does not correctly convey "sun-tanned"; the appropriate term is "braungebrannt."	- "Böses" is a mistranslation of "bald" in this context, where "Glatze" meaning "bald patch" is the correct term.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
man → Mann → Mann  	now → jetzt → Inzwischen  	bald patch → schiefes Flickwerk → Glatze  		**Explanation:** "Mann" in HYP correctly translates "man" from SRC. "Jetzt" in HYP is a viable translation of "now" from SRC, but "Inzwischen" in REF provides contextual accuracy. "Schiefes Flickwerk" in HYP is a mistranslation of "bald patch" from SRC; the correct translation is "Glatze" in REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence "Der Mann sollte nicht angesprochen werden" adequately translates the SRC sentence "The man should not be approached." The differences between HYP and REF are stylistic and do not constitute significant meaning changes.
believe → glaubt → so  	may → kann → könne
110 → nennen → rufen  		**Explanation:** "Nennen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "call"/"rufen" from SRC/REF, incorrectly conveying the action to take upon seeing Sven S.
police → Polizei → Polizei  	talking → spricht → spricht  	crime passionelle → Verbrechensliga → Beziehungstat  		**Explanation:** While "police" and "talking" are correctly translated in HYP, the term "crime passionelle" is mistranslated as "Verbrechensliga" in HYP and should be "Beziehungstat" as in REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both HYP and REF convey the meaning of the source sentence accurately in German, with HYP providing a more typical translation of "was born" as "geboren" compared to REF's "sei Jahrgang" which is slightly more idiomatic. There are no clear single-word translation errors present.
1. force → Polizeitruppe → Polizei  	2. crime → Verbrechen → Tathergang  	3. disclose → offen legen → machen  	4. person → Person → Mensch  		**Explanation:**  	- "Polizeitruppe" in HYP is a mistranslation of "force"/"Polizei" from SRC/REF. "Polizei" is the common term used for "police" in German.  	- "Verbrechen" (crime) is more generic but matches the SRC term, whereas "Tathergang" (course of the crime) in REF gives a more specific sense that aligns closely with intended meaning.	- "Offen legen" in HYP means to "disclose" or "expose," whereas "machen" in REF is the more standard way to say "make" or "provide" in this specific context.	- Both "Person" and "Mensch" mean "person," but "Mensch" is more commonly used in contexts involving life and death, providing a subtle but meaningful difference.
Mord → Mord → Tötungsdelikt
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both the HYP and REF translations adequately convey the meaning of the SRC sentence, with only minor word order differences that do not affect the overall translation accuracy.
SWAT team → SWAT-Team → Spezialeinsatzkommando (SEK)  	scene → Ort → Tatort
ray → Hoffnungsstrahl → Lichtblick
1. **geriddled → gedrängt → krisengebeutelte**  	2. **spared → erspart → verschont**  		**Explanation:**  	- "gedrängt" in HYP does not accurately translate the sense of "riddled with" which is better translated as "krisengebeutelte" in REF.	- "erspart" in HYP incorrectly translates the sense of "spared" which is contextually more accurately captured as "verschont" in REF.
No translation errors detected.
Federal → Der → Bundeswirtschaftsminister
No translation errors detected.
blast furnaces → Blasfasern → Hochofen
drohten → in Gefahr Gefahr → drohten
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The source sentence has been translated in a way where all main components align across HYP and REF translations. The variations in wording, like "grundlegende Vereinbarung" vs "Grundsatzeinigung" or "Kommissionsmitglied" vs "Wettbewerbskommissarin," are minor synonym variations that do not significantly alter the meaning and are contextually appropriate.
EEG → EEV → EEG  		**Explanation:** "EEV" in HYP is a mistranslation of "EEG"/"EEG" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning by referencing a different term.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation aligns well with the meaning of the SRC and REF sentences. While there are slight structural differences and synonym uses (e.g., "Aber auch diese" in REF vs. "Auch das" in HYP), they don't constitute clear single-word translation errors and preserve the overall meaning.
Germany → None → Deutschlands  	self-generation → Stromerzeugung → Eigenstromerzeugung
agreement → Vereinbarung → Regelung  	ruling → Urteils → Regelung
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation "Die positiven Bemühungen Gabriels sind für die Stahlindustrie besonders wichtig." aligns well with the REF and SRC, although the phrasing differs between translations, the key elements and meaning are accurately captured without clear single-word mistranslation.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The significant components of the phrase "first step within our 'steel is the future' campaign" are adequately translated in the HYP sentence when compared to the REF sentence. Discrepancies like slight differences in phrasing do not significantly alter the meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** While the sentence structures in HYP and REF differ and HYP includes additional context ("Dem"), there are no single-word mistranslations that change the meaning significantly.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation adequately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence, including the main elements such as "Climate targets", "employment objectives", "negotiations", "reform", "emissions allowances", and "Jörg Hofmann". There are no significant single-word mistranslations that change the meaning or context compared to the REF translation.
No translation errors detected.
worsened → verschlimmert → verschärfte  	brought → gebracht → warf  		**Explanation:**  	- "Verschlimmert" in HYP is a translation of "worsened," but here, "verschärfte" in REF better captures the meaning in this context.	- "Gebracht" in HYP translates to "brought," which doesn't convey the same impact as "warf," which means "threw," aligning better with the implied forceful action in the context.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
Einfuhrsteuern → Einfuhrzölle → Einfuhrzölle  	importiertes → Importstahl → Importstahl
prices → angehoben → Preiserholung
No translation errors detected.
Prices → geplündert → stagniert  		**Explanation:** "Geplündert" in HYP is a mistranslation of "plateaued"/"stagnated" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning to "plundered" instead of the intended "stagnated" or "plateaued".
sector → Sektor → Branche  	situation → Situation → Lage  	reducing prices → senkt → Kostensenkungen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Sektor" in HYP is a mistranslation of "sector"/"Branche" from SRC/REF.  	- "Situation" in HYP is a mistranslation of "situation"/"Lage" from SRC/REF.  	- "senkt" (reducing prices) in HYP should match with "Kostensenkungen" (cost reductions) from REF according to the context, hence there is a mistranslation mismatch.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
steigender Aufträge → Bestellungen → Aufträge  		**Explanation:** The HYP uses "steigender Aufträge" which translates to "increasing orders". The REF uses "zunehmenden Bestellungen", which is a more accurate translation of the source phrase "increasing orders" in this context.
Vorjahresmonat → Vorjahr → Vorjahresmonat  		**Explanation:** The term "Vorjahr" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Vorjahresmonat" from REF, which denotes "the corresponding month in the previous year" and changes the timeframe referenced in comparison.
spike → Rede → Erhöhung  	amounts → Beträge → Menge
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence, with differences only in phrasing similar meanings (e.g., "Seit Beginn des Jahres" vs. "Seit Jahresbeginn"), which do not constitute significant errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:**  	The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and aligns with the reference, even though there are minor differences in word choice (e.g., "Produktion" vs. "Ausstoß", "Auftragssituation" vs. "Auftragslage"). These differences do not constitute significant translation errors.
mind → Gesundheit → Geist  	singing → Senken → Singen  		**Explanation:** "Gesundheit" in HYP is a mistranslation of "mind"/"Geist" from SRC/REF, and "Senken" in HYP is a mistranslation of "singing"/"Singen" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.
Singing → Singapur → Singen  	sings → Sänge → singt
Singing → Singen → Singen  	physisch → körperlich → körperlich  
rehearsal → Generalprobe → Probe  	balanced → ausgewogen → ausgeglichen  	happy → glücklich → fröhlich  	generally → allgemein → insgesamt  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The single-word translations in the HYP are consistent with the SRC and convey the intended meaning when compared to the REF translation.
Singing → Singing → Singen  	Hakkler → Hakkler → Hackler  	Verband → Verband → Seniorenliga
elderly → älteren → Senioren  	enjoyment → profitieren → Freude  	says → sagen → beschreibt
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** While there are variations in word choice between HYP and REF, such as "ältere Menschen" vs. "Senioren" and "aufbauen und aufrechterhalten" vs. "knüpfen und pflegen," these are effectively synonyms or equivalent expressions that do not significantly impact the overall meaning conveyed by the translation. Therefore, no single-word translation errors are detected.
1. weaken → schwächen sich → lösen sich auf  	2. perfect → perfekte → ideale  		**Explanation:**  	- "schwächen sich" in HYP is a mistranslation of "weaken"/"lösen sich auf" from SRC/REF, as "lösen sich auf" is a more appropriate way to convey the idea of weakening in this context.  	- "perfekte" in HYP is a less fitting translation of "perfect"/"ideale" from SRC/REF. The word "ideale" better captures the intended meaning of "a perfect way" in this context.
1. Ursel → Usel → Ursel  	2. Arranging → Reichen → abzusprechen  	3. together → zusammenzuleben → Zusammenseins  		**Explanation:**  	- "Ursel" is misspelled as "Usel" in the HYP.	- "Arranging" is mistranslated as "Reichen" instead of the REF's "abzusprechen", which fits better in context.	- "together" is mistranslated as "zusammenzuleben" instead of the REF's "Zusammenseins", which more accurately represents the intended meaning.
Singing → Singingings → Singen
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence adequately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence, with no single-word mistranslations affecting overall context or meaning when compared with the REF. Minor variances in word choice do not change the overall correctness.
Lungs → Lungen → Lunge  	Breath → Atem → Puste  		**Explanation:**  	- "Lungen" in HYP is plural, whereas both SRC and REF imply singular "Lunge".	- "Atem" in HYP does not adequately convey "Puste" used in REF, which fits the context for "breath".
interested → daran interessiert → darum geht  	keep → zu halten → zu erhalten  	singing → singen → Singen  	perfect → perfekte → optimales  	hobby → Hobby → Hobby  		**Explanation:** The differences in the words "interested," "keep," "singing," "perfect," and "hobby" between the Candidate Translation (HYP) and the Reference Translation (REF) are minor and do not significantly affect the overall meaning of the sentence. Therefore, the translation errors are not impactful. However, since the task specifically asks for a list of single-word translation errors, I've identified discrepancies based on direct word comparisons.
Singing → Singing → Singen  	LEnz → Lenz → Lenz  	Association → Verband → Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft  	Senior Citizens' Associations → Seniorenverband → der Senioren-Organisationen
singing → Zusammenleben → Singen  	important → wichtiger → wichtig  	living → Lebens → Stellenwert  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Zusammenleben" (living together) in HYP mistranslates the concept of "singing"/"Singen" from SRC/REF.	2. "Wichtiger" (more important) in HYP instead of simply "Singen"/"wichtig" misrepresents the emphasis on the act of singing.	3. "Lebens" (living) in HYP doesn't fully convey the nuance of "Stellenwert" (importance/standing) in REF as related to singing.
sees → sieht → beobachtet  	listening → Anhörung → Hören
texts → Texte → Liedtexte
Singing → Singapur → Singen  	exertion → Übung → Leistung  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence accurately in comparison to the REF translation. Both translations effectively capture the main points of focusing on one's voice and rhythm, while adapting to other singers, maintaining the essence and meaning without any significant deviations.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence compared to the REF sentence. The choice of words in HYP aligns well with the translation requirements of the SRC, and there's no significant single-word translation error that alters the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Each word in the HYP sentence aligns well with the intended meaning and context of the SRC sentence and is consistent with the REF sentence. "Ein weiterer positiver Aspekt", "Anerkennung durch das Singen in einem Chor", and "Hackler denkt" are all suitable translations of their SRC counterparts, and no significant mistranslation is apparent.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence uses "glückliches" for "happy" and "großes" for "great," which are valid translations. Although "begeistertes" and "tolles" are used in REF, the variations do not significantly change the meaning. Therefore, no clear mistranslations are detected in this context.
esteem → Selbstachtung → Selbstwertgefühl  		**Explanation:** "Selbstachtung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "self-esteem"/"Selbstwertgefühl" from SRC/REF, which changes the nuance of the meaning.
improve → verbessern → besser  	gives → verleiht → stärkt  		**Explanation:** "Verbessern" in HYP mistranslates "improve" from SRC; the REF uses "besser," which is a closer match. Additionally, "verleiht," translating "gives" in HYP, does not align well with "stärkt" used in REF, which more contextually captures the strengthening aspect mentioned in the SRC.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation "Es gibt also genug gute Gründe, um zu singen" is a valid translation of the SRC sentence "So there are enough good reasons to start singing." The meaning is conveyed accurately, and the differences between HYP and REF ("um zu singen" vs. "um mit dem Singen zu beginnen") do not constitute significant translation errors.
1. try → versuchen → ausprobieren  	2. delay → verzögern → zögern  	3. suggests → schlägt vor → rät  		**Explanation:**  	- "Versuchen" in HYP is a mistranslation when compared to "ausprobieren" in REF for the context of "try a new hobby."  	- "Verzögern" is contextually incorrect for "delay" compared to the more suitable "zögern" in REF.  	- "Schlägt vor" is not the best translation for "suggests" compared to "rät" in REF.
You → Sie → Man  	yourself → von Ihnen → allein  	note's → Notiz → Ton  		**Explanation:** 	- "You" is incorrectly translated as "Sie" (formal 'you') instead of "Man" (impersonal pronoun 'one'/'you' general sense) used in REF.	- "Yourself" is incorrectly translated as "von Ihnen" ('from you') instead of "allein" ('alone'), which changes the meaning in this reflexive context.	- "Note's" is incorrectly translated as "Notiz" (written 'note') instead of "Ton" ('musical note'), which is the appropriate term in the musical context provided.

1. mewls → Mühlen → Schreie  	2. kittens → Küchen → Jungtiere
kittens → Küchenschreie → Katzenbabys
miaowing → Mieat → Miauen  	unaffected → unberührt → kalt
cats → Katzen → N/A  	tell → zeigen → erkennen  	kittens → Kitzen → Katzenbabys  	miaowing → Mieur → Miauen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Katzen" in HYP does not need correction based on the provided context.  	- "zeigen" in HYP is not accurate for "tell" in SRC, where "erkennen" in REF better fits.	- "Kitzen" is a wrong form for "kittens," whereas "Katzenbabys" is more precise according to REF.	- "Mieur" appears to be a mistranslation or typo for "miaowing," while "Miauen" correctly fits according to REF.
kittens → Kätzer → Kätzchen  	sound → klingen → wähnen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Kätzer" in HYP is a mistranslation of "kittens"/"Kätzchen" from SRC/REF, which significantly alters the meaning.	2. "klingen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "sound"/"wähnen" from SRC/REF, which changes the intended meaning in context.
Male → Männerkatzen → Kater  	cries → Kittenschreie → Rufe  
alterten → erregten → erregten  	Küchenmächen → Jungtieren → Jungtieren  		**Explanation:** "Alterten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "agitated"/"erregten" from SRC/REF and changes the context. "Küchenmächen" is a mistranslation of "kittens"/"Jungtieren," altering the meaning significantly.
first → erste → Erstautorin  	journal → Fachzeitschrift → Fachmagazin  		**Explanation:** "erste" in HYP is a mistranslation for "first" which should be "Erstautorin" given the context provided by SRC/REF. "Fachzeitschrift" in HYP is a mistranslation of "journal" which should be "Fachmagazin" in the preferred context from REF.
duration → Dauer → Dauer  	pitch → Spielraum → Tonhöhe  	kitten's miaow → eines Kittens → der Kätzchen-Schreie  		**Explanation:** The word "Spielraum" in HYP is a mistranslation of "pitch"/"Tonhöhe" from the SRC/REF, as it refers to "scope" or "leeway" which is incorrect in this context. Additionally, "eines Kittens" (a kitten) is a less accurate translation of "kitten's miaow" when compared to "der Kätzchen-Schreie" (the cries of kittens) in REF, though this involves multi-word interpretation, focusing on key changes. (Listed errors prioritize individual word accuracy here).
male → männliche → Kater  	female → weibliche → Kätzinnen  	examined → geprüft → beobachtet  		**Explanation:**  	1. "männliche" in HYP is a mistranslation of "male"/"Kater" from SRC/REF, altering the specific gender term for cats.	2. "weibliche" in HYP is a mistranslation of "female"/"Kätzinnen" from SRC/REF, altering the specific gender term for cats.	3. "geprüft" in HYP is a mistranslation of "examined"/"beobachtet" from SRC/REF, changing the action/meaning slightly.
kitten → Kätzers → Kleinen
sound → Ton → Schreien  	more → eher → stärker  	played → gezeigt → konfrontiert  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Ton" is a literal translation of "sound," but "Schreien" (cries) fits the context better as per REF.  	2. "eher" means "rather" while "stärker" means "more," as per context.  	3. "gezeigt" translates to "shown," but the context of "played" is better captured by "konfrontiert" (confronted) in the REF.
No translation errors detected.
females → Frauen → Weibchen  	offspring → Nachkommen → Nachwuchs  	differentiate → Jungfrauen → Schreie  		**Explanation:** "Frauen" in HYP translates to "women," which is incorrect for "females"/"Weibchen." "Nachkommen" refers generically to "descendants," while "offspring"/"Nachwuchs" is more specific. "Jungfrauen" means "virgins" in English and doesn't align with the context, where distinguishing "miaows"/"Schreie" is discussed.
turned → wandten → drehten  	speaker → Redner → Lautsprecher  	playing → spielten → abspielte  	highly → hoch → sehr  	agitated → akagierten → erregteren  		**Explanation:** Each word listed shows a significant change in meaning or incorrect translation based on the comparison between HYP, SRC, and REF. The mistranslations impact the proper interpretation of the sentence.
ability → Fähigkeit → Fähigkeit  	innate → inständig → angeboren  	sexual maturity → sexuelle Reife → Geschlechtsreife  		**Explanation:**  	1. "innate" was mistranslated as "inständig" in HYP, which should be "angeboren" as per REF.	2. The term "sexual maturity" is correctly translated as "sexuelle Reife" in HYP, but could be considered a partial mismatch given the context, although contextually it still conveys the intended meaning similarly to "Geschlechtsreife" in REF.
male cats → männlichen Katzen → Männchen  	Biologist → Biologe → Biologin  		**Explanation:**  	- "Männlichen Katzen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Männchen" from REF, changing the meaning from "male cats" to simply "males," which is more general and aligns with REF.	- "Biologe" in HYP is incorrect as it should be "Biologin" to match the gender context given in the REF.
reactions → Reaktionen → Geräusche  	cries → Aufschrei → Babygeräusche
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Each word or phrase in the HYP sentence is a correct translation of the SRC sentence when compared to the REF sentence. There are no significant changes in meaning.
Supecup → Supecup → Supercup
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The main elements of the sentence such as "football match" → "Fußballspiel," "coup" → "Staatsstreich/Putschversuch," and others are correctly translated or appropriately paraphrased in both HYP and REF. There are no significant single-word translation errors found.
Duel → Duel → Duell  	Zeile → Zeile → Linie  	Supecup → Supecup → Supercup  		**Explanation:** "Duel" in HYP is missing an "l" compared to the REF "Duell," "Zeile" is a mistranslation of "Linie" in REF, and "Supecup" is a typo in HYP that should be "Supercup" as in REF.
state of emergency → Ausnahmezustands → Verhängung des Ausnahmezustands  	attempted coup → Staatsstreichversuch → Umsturzversuch  		**Explanation:**  	- "Ankündigung des Ausnahmezustands" in HYP should be closer to "Verhängung des Ausnahmezustands" in REF. The phrase refers to the imposition or declaration of a state of emergency, and "Verhängung" is more appropriate than "Ankündigung" for this context.	- "Staatsstreichversuch" in HYP is a literal translation meaning an attempted coup, which is correct. However, "Umsturzversuch" in REF is a more contextually fitting term in German. Although both are correct translations in certain contexts, "Umsturzversuch" might be slightly more aligned with typical use for this context.
1. imam → Prediger → Prediger  	2. Fethula → Fethullah → Fethullah  	3. Staatsstreichversuch → Putschversuch → Putschversuch  		**Explanation:**  	- "Imam" is a mistranslation of "Prediger," as "imam" and "Prediger" refer to different concepts in this context, affecting the accuracy.  	- "Fethula" is a mistranslation of "Fethullah" due to a spelling error, which names a specific individual.  	- "Staatsstreichversuch" is a less common and somewhat incorrect translation of "Putschversuch" in this context. The latter is the more precise term used for "attempted coup."
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence "Und das hört beim Fußball nicht auf." and the REF "Dabei wird auch vor dem Fußball nicht halt gemacht." both adequately convey the meaning of the SRC sentence "And this doesn't stop for football." Even though the wording differs, the translations accurately capture the intent, and there are no significant single-word errors.
state prosecutor → Staatsanwalt → Staatsanwaltschaft  	striker → Sterkers → Starkicker  	arrest → Verhaftung → (not directly in REF, but implied by "Haftbefehl," which means "arrest warrant")

Beschuldigt → soll → (no direct REF word, but a different structure)  	Präsident → Staatspräsidenten → Präsident
No translation errors detected.
Wednesday → Mittwoch → Mittwoch  	announced → kündigte → erklärt  	night-time → nachts → nächtlichen  	democracy vigils → Demokratiekontrollen → Demokratie-Wachen  		**Explanation:**  	- Even though "announced" and "declared" (kündigte / erklärt) have close meanings, the phrase construction in REF is identifiably different from the direct use of "announced". However, since the meanings closely align, this does not constitute a highly impactful error and is thus not listed.	- "night-time" does match accurately from SRC to HYP and REF (nachts / nächtlichen), focusing here instead on the mistranslation aspect of the vigils.	- The critical error lies in "democracy vigils," where "Demokratiekontrollen" (incorrect) doesn't adequately convey "Demokratie-Wachen" (vigils/watch), significantly altering meaning.	- The list encompasses the impactful error, avoiding minor synonymous difference excursion.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately reflects the meaning and context expressed in the SRC and REF sentences, with no significant single-word errors.

hearts → geschlagen → Herz
cup → Staatssieger → Pokalsieger
Cologne native → kölnische Eingeborene → Kölner  	goals → Ziele → Toren  	assists → Unterstützung → Vorlagen  	scorer → Spitzengärtner → Topscorer  		**Explanation:**  	- "kölnische Eingeborene" is an incorrect translation of "Cologne native" as it doesn't convey the same casual meaning as "Kölner".	- "Ziele" is a mistranslation of "goals", which should be "Toren" in the sporting context.	- "Unterstützung" translates to "support", not "assists", which should be "Vorlagen".	- "Spitzengärtner" does not convey the intended sporting meaning of "scorer" and should be "Topscorer".
Fenerbahce → Fernebahn → Fenerbahce  	scored → erkannte → erzielte  	goal → Ziel → Siegtreffer
Fanatik → Fanati-Zeitung → Fanatik  	indem → indem er sagte → bejubelte  	Spielfeld → Spielfeld → Platz
season → die Saison → die Saison  	cup → die Tasse → den Pokal  		**Explanation:** "Tasse" in HYP is a mistranslation of "cup"/"Pokal" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning as "Tasse" refers to a cup as in a drinking vessel, not a trophy. "Saison" is correctly translated in both HYP and REF, thus is not a mistranslation.
record-holders → Platteninhaber → Rekordmeister
knockout → Hirngespinst → Vorrunden-K.o  	heats → Hirngespinst → Vorrunden-K.o  	Lions → Lons → Löwen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Hirngespinst" in HYP is an incorrect translation for "knockout" and "heats," which should be "Vorrunden-K.o."	2. "Lons" in HYP is a typographical error/mistranslation for "Lions," which should be "Löwen."

cup → Staatsstreich → Pokal
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The key elements "Winners Besiktas" and "saw a better year of play" are reflected correctly in both HYP and REF, considering flexibility and contextual meaning. "Sieger" aligns with "Winners" and "besseres Jahr" corresponds appropriately with "better year". The variations result from differing translation styles but do not result in substantial content errors.
matches → Spielen → Saisontreffern  	goalkeeper → Sternengestalter → Torschützenkönig  		**Explanation:**  	- "Spielen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "matches"/"Saisontreffern," referring to the goals scored rather than the matches played.  	- "Sternengestalter" in HYP is a mistranslation of "goalkeeper"/"Torschützenkönig," significantly altering the role described in the context.
1. returns → Renditen → Rückkehr  		**Explanation:** "Renditen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "returns" from SRC and "Rückkehr" in REF, altering the meaning significantly in this context.
Besktas → Besiktas → Besiktas  	Staatsstreichversuch → Putschversuch → Putschversuch  		**Explanation:**  	- "Besktas" in HYP should be "Besiktas" to correctly reflect the name from both SRC and REF.  	- "Staatsstreichversuch" is a mistranslation of "Putschversuch", as "putsch" is a more concise and contextually appropriate term in this context.
Fachzeitschrift → Fachmagazin → Fachmagazin  	Clubführers → Clubchef → Clubchef  		**Explanation:** "Fachzeitschrift" in HYP does not align with "Fachmagazin" in REF, and "Clubführers" in HYP does not match "Clubchef" in REF. These are significant because they relate to the title and position of people involved, affecting the precision of the translation.
star → Sterner → Stürmer
No translation errors detected.
Justin → Richter → Justin  	banned → verboten → gesperrt
Stepanowa → Stepanowa → Stepanowa  	banned → verboten → darf nicht  	taking → einzunehmen → starten  		**Explanation:** Here, "verboten" and "einzunehmen" in the HYP sentence are mistranslations of "banned" and "taking" from the SRC sentence, as compared to their correct meanings "darf nicht" and "starten" in the REF sentence, respectively.
guilty → Schuldige → überführte Leichtathletik-Sünder  	competing → konkurrieren → kämpfen  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence captures the meaning of the SRC sentence adequately. The difference between "Dopingproblem" (HYP) and "Thema Doping" (REF) is not significant enough to be considered an error in this context. Both serve as competent translations for "issue of doping."
1. breaststroke → Brutalitätswut → Brust		**Explanation:** In HYP, "Brutalitätswut" is a mistranslation of "breaststroke"/"Brust" from SRC/REF. The term "Brutalitätswut" is incorrect and changes the meaning significantly.
bizarre → bizarre → skurrile  	waltzed → ging → stolziert  	scene → Szene → Szenerie
1. audience → Zuhörerin → Publikum
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In reviewing the translation, each word in the candidate translation (HYP) is a viable interpretation or equivalent of words from the source (SRC) and reference (REF) sentences. There are stylistic and structural differences, but no single words in HYP significantly alter the meaning from SRC or deviate from REF.
No translation errors detected.
Justin → Gertin → Justin  	relay → Millionen → Staffel
banned → verboten → gesperrt  	doping → Doping → Dopings  		**Explanation:** "verboten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "banned"/"gesperrt" from SRC/REF as it implies "forbidden," not the act of being barred or prohibited as intended. The term "Doping" in HYP should be "Dopings" to align with the correct grammatical form of the possessive used in REF.
1. Weltmeisterschaft → Weltmeister → Olympiasieger  	2. Fußball → [No direct REF equivalent, implicit error from context]  	3. Millionen → Meter → m  		**Explanation:**  	- "Weltmeisterschaft" (World Championship) in HYP should be translated as "Weltmeister" (World Champion) or "Olympiasieger" based on context.  	- "Fußball" (football/soccer) in HYP is an incorrect insertion, as the context does not relate to football.  	- "Millionen" (millions) in HYP is mistranslated; it should instead be "Meter" (meters) or simply "m" as in REF.
Olympic → olympische → Olympiasiegerin  	Champion → Führerin → Siegerin  	Champion → Weltmeisterschaft → Weltmeisterin  	ban → Verbot → Sperre  	Oxycodone → Oxycodo → Oxycodon  		**Explanation:**  	- "olympische Führerin" in HYP does not correctly translate "Olympic champion," which should be "Olympiasiegerin" as per REF.	- "Siebenmal-Weltmeisterschaft" is a mistranslation of "seven-time World Champion," which should be "siebenfache Weltmeisterin."	- "Verbot" in HYP is a mistranslation of "ban," which should be "Sperre" in this context.	- "Oxycodo" in HYP has a typographical error and doesn't match "Oxycodone," which should be "Oxycodon."
29-Jährigen → 29-Jährigen → 29-Jährige  		**Explanation:** "Jährigen" in HYP is a grammar error where it should be singular "Jährige" to match "the 29-year-old," which is singular in SRC/REF. However, in context, this might not be considered a stark translation error, but it's noted for consistency.
2012 → 2011 → 2012  	Olympische Champion → Olympiasiegerin → Olympiasiegerin  	Weltmeisterschaft → Weltmeisterin → Weltmeisterin  	Europameisterschaft → Europameisterin → Europameisterin  	Methythinau → Methyhexaminin → Methylhexanamin

200m → 2000 → 200  	400m → 400 Millionen → 400
1. hammer → Hammer → Hammerwurf  	2. Belarus → Belarus → Weißrussland  		**Explanation:**  	- "Hammer" is an incomplete translation; "Hammerwurf" (meaning "hammer throw") provides a more specific and correct translation.	- "Belarus" should be translated as "Weißrussland" to match the REF.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately translates the meaning conveyed in the SRC sentence without any single-word translation errors. While the structure of the sentences differs, the key elements such as "Titel", "2005", "neun Jahre später", and "Testosteron-Doping" are consistent and contextually accurate.
Olympic → Olympischen → Olympia  	Champion → Champion → EM  		**Explanation:**  	- "Olympischen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Olympic" from SRC, while REF correctly uses "Olympia".	- "Champion" in HYP is a mistranslation of "European Champion" ("EM" in German) from REF, whereas REF uses "EM-Titel" to fit the context correctly.
bronze medal → Bronzemedale → Bronzemedaille		**Explanation:** "Bronzemedale" in HYP is a mistranslation due to a spelling error of "Bronzemedaille," which is correctly translated in the REF.
80.04m → 80,4 Millionen → 80,04 m
Liu Hong → Liu Hongkong → Liu Hong  	favourite → Liebhaber → Goldfavoritin  	tested → zu gewinnen → getestet  
1. champion → Weltmeister → Weltmeisterin  	2. traces → Spuren → Hinweise  	3. dietary supplement → Ernährungszusatz → Nahrungsergänzungsmittel  	4. ban → Verbot → Sperre  		**Explanation:**  	- "Weltmeister" in HYP incorrectly translates "champion" compared to "Weltmeisterin" in REF, not reflecting the female gender.	- "Spuren" in HYP does not accurately translate "traces" when compared to "Hinweise" in REF, which better matches the context.	- "Ernährungszusatz" in HYP does not align with "dietary supplement" as effectively as "Nahrungsergänzungsmittel" in REF.	- "Verbot" in HYP is less accurate compared to "Sperre" in REF when referring to the context of a ban or suspension by an agency.
No translation errors detected.
Thomas Schnöll → Thomas Schnörl → Thomas Schnöll  	Sprecherin → Sprecher → Sprecher  		**Explanation:**  	- "Thomas Schnörl" in HYP is a mistranslation/misspelling of "Thomas Schnöll" from SRC/REF, which could potentially alter the identification of a proper noun.	- "Sprecherin" (female speaker) in HYP is a mistranslation of "Sprecher" (speaker), which can change the gender-specific context in German.
cuts → Kürzungen → Schnittwunden  		**Explanation:** "Kürzungen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "cuts"/"Schnittwunden" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning from physical injuries to reductions or cutbacks.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Although there are differences in structure between the HYP and the REF translations, both convey the intended meaning of the SRC sentence accurately.

Kilometres → Kilometer → Kilometer  	Bombs → Bomben → Bomben  	Nightlife district → Nachtlebensraum → Ausgehviertel  		**Explanation:**  	"Kilometres" and "Bomben" carry the same meaning in both HYP and REF, so they are not considered errors. However, "Nachtlebensraum" in HYP is a mistranslation for "nightlife district." The REF word "Ausgehviertel" fits the context appropriately, whereas "Nachtlebensraum" does not.
Holland → Holland → Niederländer  	Italien → Italien → Italiener  
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** All words in the HYP align well with the meaning and context of the SRC and REF sentences, with minor word order differences that do not affect the overall translation accuracy.
Patong → Pong → Patong  		**Explanation:** "Pong" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Patong" from both SRC and REF, altering the specific location mentioned significantly.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both HYP and REF capture the essential meaning of the SRC sentence. The primary details about a bomb exploding in Surat Thani causing a death are conveyed without significant mistranslations, and differences are minimal, such as using "Beamten" and "städtische Angestellte" for "civil servant." These are acceptable translations within the given context.
Authorities → Behörden → Behörden  	Explosive device → Sprengstoff → Sprengsatz  	Launched → gestartet → in die Luft gegangen  	Flower bed → Blumenbett → Blumenbeet  	Edge → Rande → vor dem Revier  	Coastal police → Küstenpolizei → Küstenpolizei  	Territory → Hoheitsgebiets → Revier		- Sprengstoff → Sprengsatz  	- Blumenbett → Blumenbeet  	- Rande → vor dem Revier  	- Hoheitsgebiets → Revier  		**Explanation:**  	- "Sprengstoff" is not the same as "Sprengsatz." "Sprengstoff" refers to explosive material generally, while "Sprengsatz" is a specific explosive device.	- "Blumenbett" is an incorrect translation of "flower bed," which should be "Blumenbeet."	- "Rande" (edge) does not align well with "vor dem Revier" (in front of the district/precinct).	- "Hoheitsgebiets" (territory) doesn't perfectly match "Revier," meaning precinct or area of responsibility in this context.
Südostküste → Südküste → Südostküste  	Verletzte → Opfer → Verletzte
No translation errors detected.
bomb attacks → Bombenanschläge → Bombenattentate  	signature → Unterschrift → Handschrift  	Army General → Army General → Armeegeneral  		**Explanation:**  	- "Bombenanschläge" in HYP is a mistranslation of "bomb attacks"/"Bombenattentate" from SRC/REF. The terms carry different connotations.  	- "Unterschrift" in HYP is a mistranslation of "signature"/"Handschrift" from SRC/REF. The word choices in German differ in meaning with "Handschrift" more accurately referring to the context.  	- "Army General" is left untranslated in HYP and should be translated as "Armeegeneral" according to both the context and REF.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "mögliche Motive" (possible motives) and "muslimische Rebellen" (Muslim rebels) along with the rest of the context in HYP adequately align with the meaning from SRC and REF. The differences noted are minor and do not significantly alter the meaning, focusing on paraphrasing rather than mistranslation.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence appropriately translates the source sentence into German, and the single-word choices align well with the REF sentence. Any differences do not change the overall meaning significantly.
attacks → Anschläge → Attentate  	connected → zusammenhängen → in Zusammenhang stehen  	global → globalen → internationalen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Anschläge" (HYP) is a mistranslation of "attacks"/"Attentate" from SRC/REF; it is less fitting in this context.	- "zusammenhängen" (HYP) deviates from the intended translation for "connected"/"in Zusammenhang stehen" from SRC/REF.	- "globalen" (HYP) is a mistranslation of "global"/"internationalen" from SRC/REF contextually altering the meaning.
No translation errors detected.
**set off → abgeschossen → gelegt**  		**Explanation:** "Abgeschossen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "set off"/"gelegt" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning as "abgeschossen" implies shooting rather than setting off.
Hinweise → Notifizierungen → Hinweise  	Anschläge → Angriffe → Anschläge  		**Explanation:**  	- "Notifizierungen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Hinweise" from SRC/REF, indicating more official notifications rather than general indications or hints.	- "Angriffe" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Anschläge" from SRC/REF, which refers to attacks or assaults in a general sense rather than specifically suggesting terrorist or aggressive acts.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence adequately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence, and there are no single-word translation errors compared to the REF sentence. Despite slight stylistic changes, the meaning is maintained.
told → erzählte → wies  	nightlife → Nachtbezirke → Vergnügungsviertel
Small-scale → Kleine → kleinere  	bombings → Bombardements → Bombenanschläge  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both HYP and REF accurately convey the meaning of the source sentence with appropriate word usage, and there are no significant single-word errors present.
issued → herausgegeben → empfiehlt  	its → seiner → auf  		**Explanation:**  	1. "herausgegeben" (issued) in HYP is a mistranslation of "recommends" from SRC and "empfiehlt" from REF, which implies advice rather than distribution.  	2. "seiner" (its) in HYP is incorrectly translated in context because "auf" (on) is the expected preposition as per REF, indicating the placement of the recommendation rather than possession.
Yala → Jala → Yala  	Vihear → ViHeare → Vihear  	alert → Sicherheitswachstum → Sicherheitsrisiko  		**Explanation:** "Jala" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Yala" from SRC/REF, "ViHeare" in HYP misrepresents "Vihear" from SRC/REF, and "Sicherheitswachstum" in HYP mistranslates "security alert"/"Sicherheitsrisiko" from SRC/REF, altering the intended meaning.
skirmishes → Hin und Her → Auseinandersetzungen  	advised against → informiert → abgeraten  	travel → Einreise → Reisen  	districts → Bezirke → Provinzen
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While the phrasing is different, there are no single-word translation errors in the HYP compared to SRC and REF that significantly change the meaning. Both translations convey a similar message regarding an increased security alert for the rest of the country.
attacks → Angriffe → Anschläge  	came → kamen → erfolgten  		**Explanation:** "Angriffe" and "kamen" in the HYP are mistranslations of "attacks"/"Anschläge" and "came"/"erfolgten" from SRC/REF. The words in HYP change the meaning and context compared to the original and reference translations.
military → militärischen → Militär
Head → Leiter → Chef  	said → sagten → sagte
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence adequately captures the meaning and context of the SRC sentence when compared to the REF, with no significant single-word translation errors evident.

No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Angriff" in HYP and "Anschlag" in REF acceptably translate "attack" from the SRC. The rest of the translations, though slightly different, do not introduce any significant change in meaning.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence adequately with slight paraphrase differences from the REF. No single-word mistranslations significantly alter the meaning or create contextually inappropriate translations.
1. indicators → Anzeichen → Anhaltspunkte  		**Explanation:** "Anzeichen" in HYP mistranslates as "indicators," where "Anhaltspunkte" in REF more accurately reflects "indicators" in the context.		2. efforts → Bemühungen → Bestrebungen  		**Explanation:** "Bemühungen" in HYP mistranslates as "efforts," while "Bestrebungen" in REF better conveys the meaning in the given context.		3. free → freie → freiheitliche  		**Explanation:** "freie" in HYP mistranslates "free," but "freiheitliche" in REF properly captures the idea of "freedom" in this context of a democratic order.  		**Note:** While both "Chef des Verfassungsschutzes" and "Verfassungsschutzchef" are close in meaning, they are contextually minor differences and not included as clear translation errors based on the provided guidelines.
Muslim → Moslems → Zuwanderer  	vilified → ermordet → diffamiert  
**(SRC word → HYP word → Correct REF word)**		movement → Entwicklung → Bewegung
Identitäre Bewegung → Identitäre Gruppe → Identitäre Bewegung
multicultural → multikulturellen → Multikulti  	madness → Wahnsinn → Wahn  	mass immigration → Masseneinwanderung → Massenzuwanderung  	foreigners → Ausländer → Überfremdung  
Bavarian → Bayern → Bayern  	federal states → Bundesstaaten → Bundesländern  	Identitäre → Identitäre → Identitären  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Bavarian" in SRC translates to "Bayern" in both HYP and REF. However, "Bavarian" should be abstract to "Bayern" as a federal state, which is used consistently in both HYP and REF.	2. "federal states" in SRC is translated as "Bundesstaaten" in HYP, but "Bundesländern" in REF. "Bundesländer" is the correct term for German regions, as "Bundesstaaten" would refer more accurately to states within the US context.	3. "Identitäre" should be pluralized as "Identitären" to match the context set by "beobachten ... bereits," reflecting accurate grammatical usage.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence plausibly translates key elements of the SRC sentence with a focus on "proximity" in collaboration and decision-making, consistent with the REF translation. All differences are minor in phrasing and do not constitute meaningful translation errors.

No translation errors detected.
Bundesstaaten → Bundesländern → Bundesländer
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The translation in the HYP sentence does not contain any words that significantly alter the meaning as compared to the REF sentence.

No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation (HYP) adequately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and aligns well with the reference translation (REF). Any differences present are minor variations that do not significantly alter the sentence's meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** There are no significant single-word mistranslations in HYP when compared with SRC and REF. The meaning of the sentence is accurately preserved, despite differences in phrasing.
frightening → Besorgniserregende → erschreckend  		**Explanation:** "Erschreckend" in HYP is a mistranslation of "frightening"/"Besorgniserregende" from SRC/REF, as "erschreckend" is more aligned with "scary" rather than the nuanced "frightening" in this context.
**No translation errors detected.**  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation successfully captures the meaning of the source sentence, and while there are some differences in word choice compared to the REF, they do not constitute clear single-word mistranslations. Both translations effectively convey the same message from the source.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately translates the primary concepts and elements from the SRC sentence, and matches the REF sentence in meaning without significant single-word errors. Minor variations in wording such as synonyms and expression differences do not constitute translation errors, as they do not alter the meaning or context.
Internet-Senation → Internethit → Internethit  		**Explanation:** "Internet-Senation" in HYP is a mistranslation compared to "Internethit" in REF, which is the correct term in this context.
athletes → Sportler → Olympioniken
No translation errors detected.
Aquatics Centre → Aquatikzentrum → Aquatics Center  	swam → schwimmt → schwamm
disappeared → verschwunden → verschwand  	wide → breit → weit  	perspective → Perspektive → Ausschnitt
Habte → Habitat → Habte  	sensation → Sendung → Hit
24-Jährigen → 24-Jährigen → 24-Jährige  	haben → haben → beendet  	Hitze → Hitze → Vorlauf  	abgewickelt → abgewickelt → beendet  	von 59 von 59 → von 59 von 59 → von 59  		**Explanation:** In this example, "haben", "Hitze", and "abgewickelt" in the HYP are incorrect translations of "completed", "heat" (in a competitive context), and "completed" in the sense of "beendet"/"finished", respectively. "Hitze" translates as "heat" in a thermal context, not in competitive races. Additionally, "von 59 von 59" is a repetition error not present in the SRC or REF. Because both HYP and REF share "24-Jährigen", that part doesn't constitute a single-word mistranslation error.
However → jedoch → aber  	Eye → im Auge hatte → Aufmerksamkeit auf sich zog  	Figure → Persönlichkeit → Figur  
24-year-old → Teilnahme → 24-Jährige  		**Explanation:** In the HYP, "Teilnahme" (participation) is a mistranslation of "24-year-old" from the SRC, which is incorrectly replaced instead of referring to a person. "24-Jährige" in REF correctly translates "24-year-old."
Ethiopian → Äthiopier → Äthiopier  	swimming federation → Schwimmbadföderation → Schwimmverband  		**Explanation:**  	- The word "Ethiopian" correctly translates to "Äthiopier" in both HYP and REF, so it is not an error.	- However, "swimming federation" is mistranslated as "Schwimmbadföderation" in HYP, while the correct translation in REF is "Schwimmverband," which refers specifically to a swimming organization, not a "swimming pool federation" as "Schwimmbadföderation" would imply.
given → überlassen → verteilt  	popularise → der Popularisierung → bekannter zu machen  		**Explanation:**  	- "überlassen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "given"/"verteilt" from SRC/REF, altering the action being described.  	- "der Popularisierung" in HYP does not align well with "popularise"/"bekannter zu machen" from SRC/REF, making it contextually less accurate.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
nicknames → Namensnamen → Spitznamen
Some → Einige → Einige  	dubbed → nannten → bezeichneten  	whale → Wale → Wal  		**Explanation:** "Some" is correctly translated to "Einige," so no error there. "Dubbed" is close to "nannten" but more accurately translated as "bezeichneten" in this context, presenting a slight shift in formal usage. The significant error is "whale" translated to "Wale" (plural form in German), whereas it should be "Wal" (singular form) as in REF, changing the meaning distinctly.
flabby → abenteuerlichen → Wohlstandsbauch
minute → Minute → Minute  	seconds → Sekunden → Sekunden  	100 metre → 100-Meter → 100 Meter  	freestyle → Freetyp → Freistil  		**Explanation:** The significant mistranslation here is "freestyle" which is incorrectly translated as "Freetyp" in HYP instead of "Freistil" in REF, impacting the contextual meaning greatly. Other elements are correct or considered minor discrepancies.

No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words in HYP adequately translate the SRC sentence into German and do not exhibit significant meaning deviations when compared to the REF sentence. The differences are synonymous and do not change the overall meaning of the sentence.
metre → Stückwärme → Meter  		**Explanation:** "Stückwärme" in HYP is a mistranslation of "metre"/"Meter" from SRC/REF, as it changes the meaning and context significantly.
cheering → Gerangel → angefeuert  		**Explanation:** "Gerangel" in HYP is a mistranslation of "cheering"/"angefeuert" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the sentence's meaning.
learnt → lernen → lernte  	such → so → eine so lange Distanz  		**Explanation:**  	1. "lernen" in HYP should be "lernte" in REF, which is the correct past tense form of "learnt."  	2. "so" in HYP does not fit contextually compared to "eine so lange Distanz" in REF, which accurately translates "such a long distance."
front-row → Vorreiter → vordersten Reihe  	stunning → betäubende → atemberaubenden  
1. downtown's → Heimatstadt → Innenstadt  	2. Gesellschaft der Architekturhistorer → Society of Architectural Historians → Society of Architectural Historians  	3. hat → hält → hält  		**Explanation:**  	- "Heimatstadt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "downtown's"/"Innenstadt" from SRC/REF, as it implies a different location.	- "Gesellschaft der Architekturhistorer" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Society of Architectural Historians"/"Society of Architectural Historians" from SRC/REF, as it suggests a different organization.	- "hat" in HYP correctly translates to "holds", but "hält" is the proper verb use in this context as per the REF.
Schwartzman → Schwartzman → Schwartmann  	Vereins → Vereins → Associates  		**Explanation:** "Schwartzman" is a minor spelling error compared to "Schwartmann" due to differences, but it's contextually identical here. "Vereins" is a mistranslation of "Associates."
21 → Ø → 21. August  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence omits the date "21" or "21. August," which is explicitly mentioned in both the SRC and REF sentences, causing a significant omission and mistranslation.
Attendees → Besatzungen → Besucher  	tour → reisen → besichtigen  	Central → Zentrale → Mittelsaal  	Period → Zeiträume → Stilzimmer  	Cactus → Caks → Kaktus  	Room → Room → Salon  
Advance → Vorstandskarten → Vorverkaufstickets
open → offener → offene  	loft → Flickenteppich → Industrieloft  	cozy → Farce → gemütliches  		**Explanation:**  	- "offener" is not the correct gender for "loft" ("offene" should match "Industrieloft").  	- "Flickenteppich" (meaning patchwork rug) is a mistranslation of "loft".  	- "Farce" (meaning mockery or travesty) is a mistranslation of "cozy". 
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words in the HYP translation adequately convey the meaning of the SRC sentence and correspond well to the REF translation, with no significant single-word mistranslations present.
Theft → Diebstahl → bestohlen  
67-year-old woman → 67-jährige Frau → 67-jährige Geretsriederin  	Geretsried → Geretsry → Geretsriederin  	ground-floor window → Grundbuchfenster → Fenster im Erdgeschoss  		**Explanation:**  	1. "67-year-old woman" should be translated to "67-jährige Geretsriederin" to convey both age and origin contextually.	2. "Geretsried" is mistranslated as "Geretsry" in HYP instead of being adapted to "Geretsriederin."	3. "Ground-floor window" is translated to "Grundbuchfenster" (ledger window), which is incorrect; it should be "Fenster im Erdgeschoss" to convey the meaning accurately.
8.15 → 8.15 → 8.15  	Euro zurückkehrte → Euro zurückkam → Euro verschwunden  	fehlen → feh-		No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:**  	- The time "8.15" is consistent across all sentences.	- "Euro zurückkehrte" in the HYP inaccurately combines phrases, suggesting she returned with the money, rather than its absence. However, this error primarily concerns phrase structure rather than a single-word translation error.	- "Fehlten" in HYP vs. "verschwunden" in REF indicates a discrepancy in phrasing rather than a direct single-word error.	- After careful review, no distinct single-word translation errors were identified, with differences residing mainly in phrasing and structure.		Note: Phrasing discrepancies are noted but do not constitute singular translation errors under task instructions.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately captures the essential meaning of the SRC sentence and aligns well with the REF translation despite minor structural differences.
No translation errors detected.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump
Donald Trumpp → Donald Trump → Donald Trump  		**Explanation:** "Donald Trumpp" in HYP is a mistranslation due to the extra "p," which should match "Donald Trump" in SRC and REF. This is a single-word error that must be rectified for correct representation of the name.
Trump → Trumpp → Trump  		**Explanation:** "Trumpp" in HYP is a typographical error of "Trump" from both SRC and REF, altering the proper name slightly.
No translation errors detected.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	mir → — → —  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" in the HYP is a mistranslation of "Trump" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the context as it's an incorrect name. The word "mir" appears to incorrectly suggest an association with "me" rather than accurately reflecting the implied detachment in the SRC and REF.
he → er → ihm  	make it → macht → reiche  	ok → [not translated] → in Ordnung  	Trumpf → Trump → Trump
Obama, Clinton → den demokratischen Kandidaten → die Kandidatin der Demokraten  	militia → Terrorismus-Staat → Terrormiliz
No translation errors detected.
postal service → Postdienst → Post  	gets on board → tritt → steigt ein  	electric vehicles → Elektrofahrzeugen → Elektro-Transportern  		**Explanation:** "Postdienst" translates "postal service" correctly but "Post" is more concise in the REF. "Tritt" is a mistranslation of "gets on board," which is better captured by "steigt ein" in REF. "Elektrofahrzeugen" translates to "electric vehicles," but "Elektro-Transportern" fits better contextually in this instance, implying a fleet or business usage.
Deutsche → Detusche → Deutschen  	truck → Lkw → Zustellfahrzeug  
No translation errors detected.
postal service → Postdienst → Post  	vehicle → Elektroauto → Elektrofahrzeug
company → Unternehmen → Konzern  	retailing → Einzelhandel → Handel  	vehicle → Fahrzeug → Transporter  		**Explanation:**  	- "Unternehmen" is a general term for "company," while "Konzern" more accurately reflects the context of a large business.	- "Einzelhandel" is more specific to "retail," while "Handel" is a broader term for "trade," fitting better contextually here.	- "Fahrzeug" translates to "vehicle," while "Transporter" is a more precise translation in this context.
postal service → Postdienst → Post  	vehicle → Elektrofahrzeuge → Elektro-Transporter  	automotive → Automobilmarkt → Automarkt  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation (HYP) accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence (SRC). The phrase structure and word choices in HYP sufficiently align with REF, with no significant single-word translation errors affecting the sentence's meaning.
months → Monaten → Monate  	parcels → Parallelen → Päckchen  		**Explanation:** 	- "Monaten" in HYP matches "months" in SRC, but the sentence structure is different; no single-word error is apparent here, focusing on the different strings "Monaten" and "Monaten".  	- "Parallelen" in HYP is a mistranslation compared to "parcels"/"Päckchen" in SRC/REF, changing the meaning and context within the sentence.
Managing Director → Geschäftsführer → Vorstand  	demand → Forderungen → Nachfragen
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The differences between HYP and REF, such as "Firma" vs "Konzern" and "Fahrzeugs" vs "Fahrzeuge", are minor synonym variations or grammatical differences that don't signify clear mistranslations of the source sentence.
per level → jährlich → pro Jahr und Schicht
announced → haben angekündigt → hatte angekündigt  	company → Deutschen → Konzern  	fleet → Elektrofahrzeuge → Flotte  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Haben angekündigt" in HYP mistranslates "announced" as "had announced" using "haben" instead of "hatte," losing the past tense context.	2. "Deutschen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "company," which correctly would be "Konzern" or "Unternehmen," as used in business context.	3. "Elektrofahrzeuge" in HYP is used incorrectly for "fleet," where "Flotte" correctly refers to the group of vehicles.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words used in the candidate translation (HYP) are appropriate translations of the source sentence and fit contextually with the reference translation. Words like "machen" for "will take," "starken" for "strong," and "Richtung" for "towards" align well with their meanings and contexts, demonstrating minor synonym variations at most.
No translation errors detected.
StreetScooter → StreetScoter → StreetScooter  	out and about → verschwunden → aktiv  		**Explanation:** "StreetScoter" in HYP is a misspelling of "StreetScooter" from SRC/REF. "Verschwunden" means "disappeared" or "gone," which is a mistranslation of "out and about" from SRC and "aktiv" from REF.
managing director → Verwaltungsdirektor → Führung  	steps down → fällt zurück → tritt ab  	GfK → GGK → GfK  		**Explanation:**  		- **"managing director"** is mistranslated as **"Verwaltungsdirektor"** instead of **"Führung."**	- **"steps down"** is mistranslated as **"fällt zurück"** instead of **"tritt ab."**	- **"GfK"** is mistakenly translated as **"GGK"** instead of keeping it as **"GfK."**
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Despite minor wording differences, both HYP ("Verbraucherforschungsfirma"/"Geschäftsführers") and REF ("Konsumforschungsunternehmen"/"Chef") adequately translate the SRC sentence's meaning without significant errors.
His → Die → Sein  	resignation → Rücktritte → Rücktritt  	swiftly → plötzlich → schnell  	complete → ganz → vollkommene  		**Explanation:**  	- "His" is translated as "Sein" in HYP, which matches the possessive context but deviates from the plural form "Die" used in REF.  	- "Resignation" is translated as "Rücktritte" in REF (suggesting plural), but it is translated as "Rücktritt" in HYP (singular).  	- "Swiftly" in SRC is translated as "schnell" in HYP, which means "fast,” whereas "plötzlich" in REF translates more accurately to "suddenly."  	- "Complete" is translated as "vollkommene" in HYP, which implies "perfect" or "entire," while "ganz" in REF aligns more closely with "complete" in the context of "surprise."
Matthias Harmann → Matthias Hartmann → Matthias Hartmann
1. fifth → Fünftel → weltweite Nummer Fünf  	2. personal → persönlichen → personellen
GfK → GGKK → GfK
GfK → GFK → GfK  	Überwachungsrates → Überwachungsrates → Aufsichtsrats  	Überwachungsausschuss → Überwachungsausschuss → Aufsichtsgremium  		**Explanation:** 	- "GfK" is not consistently capitalized in HYP when compared to REF. This is a minor error, but consistency is important for proper nouns.	- "Überwachungsrates" in HYP is a mistranslation for "supervisory board" which should be "Aufsichtsrats" as in REF.	- "Überwachungsausschuss" in HYP does not match the correct translation "Aufsichtsgremium" as in REF.
Hausruckinger → Hauruckinger → Hausruckinger  		**Explanation:** In the HYP, "Hauruckinger" is a mistranslation of the name "Hausruckinger," which is correctly presented in the SRC and REF. Names should be consistently translated.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The differences in words like "Rücktritt" vs. "Rücktritte" and "Unternehmensführung" vs. "geschäftspolitische Ausrichtung" are not significant mistranslations and do not change the fundamental meaning of the sentence. Therefore, no single-word translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Einzelheiten" in HYP and "Details" in REF adequately convey "details" from SRC, and the sentences present no significant mistranslation errors for single words.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The translations in the HYP sentence accurately convey the same meaning as the SRC and REF sentences, with no significant mistranslations affecting the interpretation of the text.
Investment → Anleger → Anleger  		**Explanation:** "Investment" in HYP is a mistranslation of "investor"/"Anleger" from SRC/REF, which changes the context in which opinions are being discussed.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
GfK → GFK → GfK
quants → Better → Quandts  		**Explanation:** "Better" in HYP incorrectly translates "quants," which should be "Quandts" as per REF, significantly altering the meaning.
losses → Verlusten → Rückschlägen
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation (HYP) conveys the meaning of the source sentence accurately without any significant single-word mistranslations that change the context or meaning. The difference between "lower" and "unter dem Niveau" in HYP and REF, respectively, doesn't constitute a mistranslation but rather a stylistic variation, and the primary figures and context (turnover amounts, comparison to the previous year, etc.) are correctly represented.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both HYP and REF adequately convey the meaning of the SRC sentence, with minor differences in phrasing that do not significantly alter the overall meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence maintains the meaning and context when compared to the REF and SRC sentences, with no significant single-word mistranslations.

fire → freigelassen → befreite  	passengers → Passagiere → Insassen  
rescue vehicles → Rettungsfahrzeuge → Rettungswagen  	ambulance → Krankenwagen → Notarztwagen  	road → Straße → Landesstraße  		**Explanation:**  	- "Rettungsfahrzeuge" (rescue vehicles) in HYP should translate to "Rettungswagen" (rescue wagons) in REF.  	- "Krankenwagen" (ambulance) in HYP should be more accurately translated as "Notarztwagen" (emergency medical vehicle) in REF.  	- "Straße" (road) in HYP should be more specifically "Landesstraße" (state road) in REF. These change the meaning and specificity of the information.
1. Krummörn → Krummhörner → Krummhörner  		**Explanation:** "Krummörn" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Krummhörner" as seen in both SRC and REF, which changes the context slightly due to incorrect place naming.
They → Sie → sie  	coach company → Busgesellschaft → Reiseunternehmens  		**Explanation:**  	- "They" is translated as "Sie" in HYP, which is capitalized and suggests a formal pronoun or beginning of a sentence, unlike the lowercase "sie" in REF, which correctly follows after a coordinating conjunction or existing flow.	- "coach company" in SRC refers to a transport service company specifically for long-distance journeys and tours, which matches "Reiseunternehmens" (travel company) more precisely than the more generic "Busgesellschaft" (bus company) in HYP.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC and matches the REF closely enough. The differences observed are synonymous and do not affect the meaning significantly. For instance, "Lkw-Fahrer" and "Lasterfahrer" are both appropriate translations for "lorry driver."
Zultenberg → Lalltenberg → Zultenberg  		**Explanation:** "Zultenberg" from SRC/REF has been mistranslated as "Lalltenberg" in HYP, changing the meaning by incorrectly naming a location.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The words in HYP correspond adequately to SRC and do not depict a significant mistranslation compared to REF that alters the meaning. "Abwasserentgelte" and "Abwassergebühr" are regarded as translation variations without significant change in meaning.
No translation errors detected.
Steinhäuser → Steinkott → Steinhäuser  	Haushaltsplans → Haushalts → Haushalts  	Bezirksverwaltung → Landratsamt → Landratsamt  	Kläranlagen → Abwasseranlagen → Abwasseranlagen  	unterfinanziert → Unterdeckungen → Unterdeckungen  		**Explanation:** The names "Steinkott" in HYP and "Steinhäuser" in SRC/REF do not match, indicating a significant error. "Haushaltsplans" in HYP is incorrect compared to "Haushalts" in SRC/REF. "Bezirksverwaltung" in HYP incorrectly translates "district administration," compared to "Landratsamt" in REF. "Kläranlagen" in HYP does not match "Abwasseranlagen" from SRC and REF, and "unterfinanziert" in HYP should be "Unterdeckungen," matching REF context.
legally → rechtlich → aufgrund rechtlicher Grundlagen  	sewage works → Abwasserwerke → Anlagen  	break even → durchbrechen → kostendeckend

No translation errors detected.
administrative director → Verwaltungsdirektor → Verwaltungsleiter  	committee → Ausschuss → Gremium  	sewage plants → Klärwerke → Abwasseranlagen  	market town → Marktstadt → Marktgemeinde  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The differences between HYP and REF are stylistic choices or synonyms (e.g., "Überfinanzierung" vs. "Überdeckungen", "Unterfinanzierung" vs. "Unterdeckungen"), and both adequately convey the meaning of the source sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words and meaning in the HYP translation align well with the SRC sentence and the REF translation. There are no significant single-word translation errors that alter the context or meaning.
As a result → Infolge → So  	low → geringen → geringen (No error for "low")  	distribution → Verteilung → Verteilungsgrundlage  	expenses → Kosten → Aufwendungen  	critical → kritische → notwendige  		**Explanation:** "Infolge" and "So" both can convey causative meaning, but "So" is more aligned with the provided contextual flow of the "Reference". "Verteilung" translates to "distribution," but "Verteilungsgrundlage" implies "basis of distribution," which specifies the context more accurately. "Kosten" vs. "Aufwendungen" could each translate to "expenses," but "Aufwendungen" assumes a broader meaning, often fitting better with financial contexts. "Kritische" for "critical" is technically correct; however, "notwendige" or "necessary" aligns with a needed repair sense in the context, thus HYP and REF focus diverge here, but this may not strictly qualify as a mistranslation.
amount → Abwassermenge → Abwasseraufkommen  	plants → Kraftwerken → Anlagen  		**Explanation:** "Abwassermenge" in HYP is a less accurate translation of "amount" compared to "Abwasseraufkommen" in REF. "Kraftwerken" in HYP is a mistranslation of "plants"/"Anlagen," which refers to facilities, not power plants.
1. calculation period → Berechnungszeitraum → Kalkulationszeitraum  	2. treatment plants → Behandlungsanlagen → Anlagen  	3. renovation → Renovierungsarbeiten → Sanierungsaufwendungen  	4. repair works → Reparaturarbeiten → Reparaturaufwendungen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Berechnungszeitraum" in HYP should be "Kalkulationszeitraum" as per REF for "calculation period".  	- "Behandlungsanlagen" in HYP should be "Anlagen" as per REF for "treatment plants".  	- "Renovierungsarbeiten" in HYP should be "Sanierungsaufwendungen" as per REF for "renovation".  	- "Reparaturarbeiten" in HYP should be "Reparaturaufwendungen" as per REF for "repair works".  		These are significant enough to affect the meaning of the translation in the given context.
plant → Werk → Anlage  	plants → Werke → Anlagen  		**Explanation:** In the context of the provided sentences, "Werk" in HYP is a mistranslation of "plant"/"Anlage" from SRC/REF, which affects the understanding as "Werk" typically refers to a factory or plant, but in German "Anlage" is more closely related to facility or installation which suits the context better. Similarly, "Werke" for "plants" may imply a different type of facility than the typically understood "Anlagen" in this specific context.
Anlage → Abfallbehandlungsanlage → Abwasseranlage  	ersetzt → ersetzt werden muss → ausgetauscht werden musste  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Abfallbehandlungsanlage" in HYP is a mistranslation of "waste treatment plant" compared to "Abwasseranlage" in REF. The specific type of facility is crucial to the context.	2. "ersetzt werden muss" ("must be replaced") in HYP incorrectly conveys the timing of the action compared to "ausgetauscht werden musste" ("had to be replaced") in REF, altering the urgency and past context of the replacement.
1. pumping station → Fernleitungsnetz → Pumpwerk  	2. clarification pond → Klärungsstellchen → Klärteich  	3. dredged → abgezogen → ausgebaggert  		**Explanation:**  	- "Fernleitungsnetz" in HYP is a mistranslation of "pumping station" from SRC and should be "Pumpwerk" as in REF.	- "Klärungsstellchen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "clarification pond" from SRC and should be "Klärteich" as in REF.	- "abgezogen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "dredged" from SRC and should be "ausgebaggert" as in REF.

No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The word choices in the candidate translation (HYP) match adequately with the meanings in both the source (SRC) and reference (REF) sentences. There are no single-word translation errors that significantly alter the meaning of the content.
Steinhäuser → Steinfallen → Steinhäuser
Schmidt → sich ausdehnte → ergänzte  	Market town → Marktstadt → Marktgemeinde  	Maintenance → Instandhaltung → Unterhaltung  	Sewage treatment → Kläranlagen → Abwasseranlagen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "sich ausdehnte" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Schmidt expanded" (contextually meaning "added" or "explained") from SRC/REF, where it should be "ergänzte" or a similar term for adding/explaining.	2. "Marktstadt" in HYP mistranslates "market town," which in REF is correctly "Marktgemeinde". A more fitting term contextually is "Marktgemeinde," matching SRC and REF.	3. "Instandhaltungskosten" in HYP mistranslates "maintenance costs," which should be "Unterhaltungskosten" in this context according to the REF.	4. "Kläranlagen" in HYP mistranslates "sewage treatment plants," which should be "Abwasseranlagen" aligning with the REF.
Steinhäuser → Steinfett → Steinhäuser  	Abwasser → Abfall → Abwasser  	Friesenbachtal → Friesenbaal → Friesenbachtal  
Bulgaria → bulgarischen Postämter → Bulgarien  	Posts → Postämter → verbucht  		**Explanation:** "bulgarischen Postämter" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Bulgaria" and "Posts" based on context from SRC and REF. "Bulgarien" and "verbucht" correctly represent these concepts in REF.

Fehlschritte → Fehltritte → Fehltritte  	öffentlich → Öffentlichkeit → Öffentlichkeit  		**Explanation:** "Fehlschritte" in HYP is a mistranslation of "missteps"/"Fehltritte," and "öffentlich" does not align with "public record"/"Öffentlichkeit," altering the intended meaning.
Apfel → Apfel → App  	Schwarze Gesicht → Schwarze Gesicht → Blackface  	Hitzentonen → Hitzentonen → weiße Haut  		**Explanation:** "Apfel" is a mistranslation of "app," "Schwarze Gesicht" mistranslates "Blackface," and "Hitzentonen" does not match the intended "weiße Haut" (whitened skin tones) based on the SRC and REF, leading to significant changes in meaning.
lens → Lied → Filter  	slanted → ein Auge in die Augen → Schlitzaugen  	distorted → Zähne verzerrte → falsche Zähne  	puffy → faule → aufgedunsene  	cheeks → Zähne → Wangen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Lied" in HYP ("song" in English) is a mistranslation of "lens" from SRC and does not match "Filter" ("lens" or "filter" in this context) in REF.	2. "ein Auge in die Augen" in HYP does not correctly translate "slanted" and does not match "Schlitzaugen" in REF, which is contextually accurate.	3. "Zähne verzerrte" in HYP ("distorted teeth" in English) incorrectly reflects the intended "falsche Zähne" in REF.	4. "faule" in HYP ("lazy/bad teeth" in English) does not contextually make sense for "puffy" and does not match "aufgedunsene".	5. "Zähne" in HYP translates to "teeth", which incorrectly renders "cheeks" and deviates from "Wangen".
No translation errors detected.
news → Nachrichten → Nachrichten  	outrage → Empörung → Empörung  	went wide → gingen weit → wurden weit verbreitet  	feature → Merkmal → Feature		### **Explanation:**		- **"went wide" → "gingen weit" → "wurden weit verbreitet":** The phrase "went wide" is translated as "wurden weit verbreitet" in REF, indicating the meaning of being spread. "Gingen weit" in HYP is incorrect as it does not convey this sense of dissemination.	- **"feature" → "Merkmal" → "Feature":** While "Merkmal" may be a technically correct synonym, "Feature" is more contextually appropriate in tech-related discussions as indicated by REF. 		No single-word errors are present for "news" and "outrage" as "Nachrichten" and "Empörung" accurately translate those terms in both HYP and REF.

Korean American → amerikanischer Kunststudent aus Korea → koreanisch-amerikanische Kunststudentin  	Tweet → Tränen → Tweet  	lens → Linsen → Filter  
added → hinzu: → hinzu  	hard → schwer → schwierig  	comparison → Seite an Seite → Gegenüberstellung  	gross → grobe → widerlichen  		**Explanation:**   		- "hinzu:" in HYP is a valid translation of "added" from SRC via "hinzu" in REF. However, the punctuation ":" is not accurately aligned with "hinzu" in context, and the error here is minor and acceptable as stylistic.  	- "schwer" in HYP is a simpler translation than "schwierig," which means "hard" as well but is syntactically less formal.  	- "Seite an Seite" in HYP translates to "side by side" directly, which is not the same as "comparison" ("Gegenüberstellung"), which focuses on the correct sense in REF.  	- "grobe" in HYP means "coarse" or "rude" rather than "very gross," which "widerlichen" (disgusting or hideous) correctly conveys in REF.
gelbe → gelbgesichtig → gelbgesichtig  	Gesichter → Gelbgesicht → Gelbgesicht  		**Explanation:** "gelbe" and "Gesichter" in HYP are mistranslations of "yellowface"/"gelbgesichtig" in SRC/REF, altering the intended context and meaning, which refers to the specific concept of "yellowface".
Tripwires → Trippen → Stolperdrahte
culture → Kultur → Diversitäts-  	boardrooms → Verwaltungsräten → Konferenzräumen  	carry → haben → halten  
younger → junger → jungen  	diverse → rassistischer → diverser  		**Explanation:** "Jungen" in HYP is an incorrect translation because it alters the structure inaccurately compared to "junger Leute" in REF. Additionally, "rassistischer" in HYP is a mistranslation for "diverse"/"diverser," as it conveys the opposite meaning and significantly changes the context.
Snapchat → Snapchat → Snapchats  	Klatte → Klatte → Katie  		**Explanation:** "Snapchat" should reflect possession as it refers to one of Snapchat's lenses, which is conveyed correctly in REF as "Snapchats." Additionally, "Klatte" in HYP is a typographical error for "Katie," which is referenced clearly in SRC and REF.
Ms. → M. → Zhu  	Produktleiterin → Produktmanagerin → Produktmanagerin  	streichen → löschen → löschen
race-related → rassistischen → rassenbezogene  	lack of diversity → mangelnde Vielfalt → Mangel an Diversität  	hiring practices → Anstellung → Einstellungspraktiken  
Ms. → M. → (no corresponding word, Ms. should not be abbreviated)  	ended → endete (mit einem Essay) → beendete ihren Aufsatz (mit einem Hashtag)  	Hashtag → (implies part of the translation is missing)  → Hashtag		**Explanation:** 	1. "Ms." is unnecessarily abbreviated to "M." in the HYP translation, losing clarity.	2. "ended with an essay" is incorrect in HYP. The correct translation should convey "ended her essay with a hashtag."	3. The hashtag #DeleteSnapchat has been mistranslated to "Deletsenapchat," although this is technically not a single-word error but it's essential as it’s misleading and transforms the intended meaning.
people of color → Farbleuten → Menschen mit anderen Hautfarben  	people of color → Farbmänner → Menschen mit anderen Hautfarben
No translation errors detected.
figures → Zahlen → keine Zahlen  	diversity → Vielfalt → Diversität  	noting → nimmt → weist hin auf  		**Explanation:**  	- "Zahlen" in HYP matches with "figures" and is part of the expression "keine Zahlen", so there is no mistranslation for "figures".  	- "Vielfalt" and "Diversität" both mean "diversity", thus "Vielfalt" is not a mistake.  	- "nimmt seinen Status zur Kenntnis" would imply that the company is noting their status in terms of acknowledging, while "weist auf seinen Status hin" signals the company is pointing it out, making "nimmt" slightly incorrect in context as it changes the intended meaning.
racial → rassischen → kulturellen  	recruiter → Rekrutierer → Personalverantwortlichen  	inclusion → Eingliederung → Integrations  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence is a valid translation of the SRC sentence, and while there are minor differences in phrasing between HYP and REF, they do not change the meaning significantly. "Konto Snapchat" and "Snapchat-Konto", as well as "Nutzer" and "User", are not significant translation errors.
Military Officials → Durchführung → Militärführung  	Distorted → Durchführung → verfälsche  	Congressional → Congressial → Kongresses  		**Explanation:**  	- "Durchführung" in HYP is an incorrect translation of "Military Officials." It changes the intended meaning. The correct term is "Militärführung."  	- "Durchführung" in HYP is also used incorrectly for "Distorted," which should be "verfälsche" in this context.  	- "Congressial" in HYP does not accurately translate "Congressional," which should be "Kongresses."
1. Officials → Beamte → Militärangehörige  	2. Central Command → Zentralbefehlshaber → Central Command  	3. intelligence reports → Nachrichtenberichte → nachrichtendienstliche Informationen
1. interim → Zwischenbericht → vorläufige	2. Armed Services Committee → Unterausschuss für bewaffnete Dienste → Streitkräftekommitees	3. Intelligence → Zentralkommunikationsanalysten → Geheimdienstanalysten	4. doctoring → dokumentiert → veränderten		**Explanation:** 	- "Zwischenbericht" in HYP should be "vorläufige" as in REF, indicating a mistranslation of "interim."	- "Armed Services Committee" in SRC is mistranslated as "Unterausschuss für bewaffnete Dienste" in HYP, which should be "Streitkräftekommitees."	- "Central Command intelligence analysts" should translate to something akin to "Geheimdienstanalysten" instead of the incorrect "Zentralkommunikationsanalysten."	- "Doctoring" is mistranslated as "dokumentiert" when it should convey the meaning of "veränderten" as in REF.
Central Command → Zentralkommando → Central Command  	military headquarters → Militärquartier → militärische Hauptquartier

Centcom → Cenzom → ihren Vorgesetzen
Central Command → zentrale → Central Command  	press releases → Pressemitteilungen → Pressemitteilungen  	statements → Erklärungen → Stellungnahmen  	congressional → kongressische → vor dem Kongress  	testimonies → Zeugenaussagen → Aussagen  		**Explanation:**  	- "zentrale" in HYP does not correctly translate "Central Command" from SRC or align with REF.  	- "Erklärungen" and "Zeugenaussagen" in HYP mistranslate "statements" and "testimonies," which are rendered more accurately as "Stellungnahmen" and "Aussagen" in REF.  	- "kongressische" in HYP is incorrect for "congressional," better translated as "vor dem Kongress" in REF.
Centcom → Zentrums → Centcom  	Überfall → Rückeroberung → Rückeroberung

1. created → geschaffen → ins Leben gerufen  	2. concerns → Bedenken → Sorgen  	3. intelligence → Intelligenz → Berichten  		**Explanation:**  	- "geschaffen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "created" and "ins Leben gerufen" in REF, altering the connotative meaning.  	- "Bedenken" in HYP is different from "Sorgen" in REF, but it's a minor discrepancy, though still noted for distinctiveness in context.  	- "Intelligenz" in HYP incorrectly translates "intelligence" in SRC when compared to "Berichten" in REF, impacting the meaning about intelligence reports.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In this case, the difference between "Dem" in HYP and "Der" in REF does not constitute a significant mistranslation error in the context of the sentence, as it reflects a minor grammatical or stylistic choice. Both translations convey the intended meaning of the source sentence and accurately reflect its content.
Centcom → Zentcom → Centcom  	Geheimdienste → Berichte → intelligence  		**Explanation:** "Zentcom" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Centcom" from SRC/REF, and "Geheimdienste" in HYP is an incorrect translation of "intelligence"/"Berichte," distorting the intended meaning.
Taskforce → Task Force → Task Force  		**Explanation:** "Taskforce" in HYP is a mistranslation when compared to the correct translation "Task Force" in REF. This change could affect the overall clarity or professionalism of the text.
Centcom → Cencom → Centcom  	inselliaren → eingeschränkten → insularen  	Schaater → Schiff → Schiff  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Cencom" in HYP is a misspelling of "Centcom".	2. "inselliaren" in HYP is a mistranslation of "insular", where "eingeschränkten" (REF) is a valid German translation.	3. "Schaater" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Schiff".
Mr. Schiff → Herr Schawland → Mr. Schiff  	stalled → bremste → verzögerte  	release → Freigabe → Veröffentlichung
Schiff → Schaator → Schiff  	Centcom → Centom → Centcom  	preset → Prestige → bestimmten  
congressional → kongressiven → Kongresses  	investigation → Untersuchung → Ermittlungen  
Centcom → Zentcom → Centcom  	Im → Im vergangenen → Im  	Existenz → Existenz → Ermittlungen  	Generaluntersuchung → Generaluntersuchung → Ermittlungen  		**Explanation:** "Zentcom" in HYP is a mistranslation compared to "Centcom" in SRC and REF. The use of "Im" with "letzten Jahres" (last year) is acceptable but differs from "Im vergangenen" (last August). The words "Existenz" and "Generaluntersuchung" are inaccurately used for "Ermittlungen".
Lt. Cmdrd. → Lt. Cmdr. → Lt. Cmdr.  	Inspektors → Generalinspekteurs → Generalinspekteurs  		**Explanation:** "Lt. Cmdrd." in HYP is a typographical error of "Lt. Cmdr." from both SRC and REF. "Inspektors" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Generalinspekteurs" in REF, which is a more accurate representation of "inspector general" as mentioned in SRC.
But → jedoch → Aber  	However, in this context, "however" does not convey the exact meaning as "But" from the source, and "jedoch" should be "Aber" based on the REF translation.		Nachrichtengemeinschaft → Nachrichtendienste → Nachrichtendienste  	In this context, "Nachrichtengemeinschaft" is a mistranslation of the English term "intelligence community," which should be "Nachrichtendienste," aligning with the REF.		No further single-word errors change the meaning significantly or contextually.
The key mistranslation in the HYP sentence compared to the SRC and REF is:		1. investigation → Untersuchung → Ermittlungen		**Explanation:** "Untersuchung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "investigation" from SRC, which is more accurately represented by "Ermittlungen" in REF. The context suggests a more thorough investigation, for which "Ermittlungen" (investigations) is a better fit.  		All other words in the HYP sentence sufficiently align with the meaning in the SRC and are correctly translated according to the REF.
allegations → Behauptungen → Anschuldigungen  	rely → zählen → verlassen  
1. critiques → Kritiken → Kritik  	2. intelligence → Nachrichtenübermittlung → Geheiminformationen  	3. mirror → spiegeln → erinnern  	4. force → Kraft → Besatzungstruppe

officials → (not translated) → Regierungsstellen  	airstrikes → Bombardierungen → Luftschläge  	Islamic State-held → (not translated) → vom Islamischen Staat gehaltene  	makeshift → Notrufraffinerien → provisorische  		**Explanation:** 	- "officials" is missing in the HYP translation, whereas it is present as "Regierungsstellen" in the REF.	- "airstrikes" is mistranslated as "Bombardierungen" instead of "Luftschläge".	- The phrase "Islamic State-held" is not appropriately translated in the HYP, while it is translated as "vom Islamischen Staat gehaltene" in the REF.	- "makeshift" is mistranslated as "Notrufraffinerien", which is incorrect. The correct term "provisorische" is used in REF.
But → Diese → However  	distributed → verteilt → veröffentlicht

Austin → Autin → Austin  	Zentralkommando → Central Command → Central Command  		**Explanation:**  	"Autin" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Austin" from both SRC and REF, significantly altering the meaning.

U.S. → USA: Win Wins → gewinnen Match →   viertes im →   Match Shown →   Showdown Shown →   steht Großbritannien →   bevor
Katie → Kratte → Katie  	goals → Ziele → Tore		**Explanation:** "Kratte" in HYP is a typographical error for "Katie," and "Ziele" is a mistranslation of "goals"/"Tore," which is more contextually relevant for field hockey.
goals → Ziele → Tore
No translation errors detected.
people → diejenigen → Leuten  	track → verfolgen → Gedächtnis  	goals → Ziele → Tore  
Americans → Amerikaner → Amerikanerinnen  	tournament → Turnus → Wettkampf  	group → Fraktion → Gruppe  	defeating → Niederlage → Sieg  	remained unbeaten → ungeschoren blieb → ungeschlagen bleiben

teams → Teams → Mannschaften  	quarter finals → vierteljährlichen Finale → Viertelfinale  	six-team -> Sechs-Mann → sechs Teams  	finishes → fertig → erlangen  	finishes → ausläuft → erlangen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Teams" in HYP is a less accurate translation of "Mannschaften" in REF. "Mannschaften" is more contextually appropriate in the sports context.	2. "vierteljährlichen Finale" in HYP mistranslates "quarter finals" from SRC, which should be "Viertelfinale" as in REF.	3. "Sechs-Mann" in HYP is a mistranslation of "six-team," which should be "sechs Teams" as per REF.	4. The first "finishes" translated as "fertig" in HYP is incorrect. The appropriate word in the context should be "erlangen," aligning with the REF.	5. The second "finishes" translated as "ausläuft" in HYP is incorrect. The correct contextual translation should be "erlangen," as used in REF.
first-place finisher → Finaler → Erstplatzierte  	bracket → Karte → Gruppe  	quarter finals → Viertelstunde → Viertelfinalen  		**Explanation:** "Finaler" is a mistranslation for "first-place finisher"/"Erstplatzierte"; "Karte" misinterprets "bracket"/"Gruppe"; "Viertelstunde" inaccurately translates "quarter finals"/"Viertelfinalen" which refers to a specific sports context, not a time duration.
Americans → Amerikaner → Amerikanerinnen  	stir → Aufruhr → Wirbel  	run → Aufmarsch → Erfolgsgeschichte  	finishing → Abschluss → landeten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Amerikaner" in HYP is not gender-specific, while "Amerikanerinnen" in REF correctly specifies the women's team ("Americans" can refer to either gender but "Amerikanerinnen" is correctly used in the context in REF).  	2. "Aufruhr" in HYP is a mistranslation of "stir"/"Wirbel", which suggests a commotion or stir rather than an upheaval ("Aufruhr" implies a more negative connotation of upheaval).  	3. "Aufmarsch" in HYP means "march" or "parade", which differs from the contextually appropriate "run"/"Erfolgsgeschichte" ("Erfolgsgeschichte" emphasizes a sequence of successes).  	4. "Abschluss" in HYP suggests a closure or completion, which mismatches "finishing"/"landeten" where the latter indicates their placing in a competition.
Bam → Damals → Bam  		**Explanation:** "Damals" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Bam" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning of the sentence.
Blue → Blaue → Blue  	Akteur → Akteur → Spieler  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Blue" is mistranslated as "Blaue." The name "Blue Bell" should remain unchanged as a proper noun.	2. "Akteur" in HYP does not convey the correct sense of "Spieler" or "player" from SRC/REF in the context of sports.

Additionally, "Teamate" in HYP is a mistranslation or typo of "teammates" which should match "Team" as in REF.
year → Jahr → Jahr  	coach → Bus → Trainer  		**Explanation:** "Bus" in HYP is a mistranslation of "coach"/"Trainer" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning. "Jahr" is correctly translated, so it is not an error despite being highlighted incorrectly.
mental → psychischer → mental  	physical → physischer → körperlicher  
work rate → Arbeitsquote → Arbeitspensum  		**Explanation:** "Arbeitsquote" in HYP is a mistranslation of "work rate"/"Arbeitspensum" from SRC/REF, changing the intended meaning and context.
No translation errors detected.
scoring → Screening → Torreigen  	backhand shot → (missing in HYP) → Rückhandschlag  		**Explanation:** "Screening" in HYP is a mistranslation of "scoring"/"Torreigen" from SRC/REF.

1. Turnus → Turnier → Turnier  	2. Zeitraum → Viertel → Viertel  	3. Verantwortung → Spiel → Spiel  		**Explanation:** 	- "Turnus" in HYP is a mistranslation of "tournament" from SRC, which is correctly translated as "Turnier" in REF.	- "Zeitraum" in HYP does not fit contextually for "period" in this sports context, which is better captured by "Viertel" in REF.	- "Verantwortung" is incorrectly capturing the context in HYP towards the end of the sentence; it deviates slightly from the intention of the SRC's "took charge," more fittingly aligned with "Spiel in ihre Hände nahm" in REF.
1. run → beschäftigt → Sprint  	2. curled → getrickst → zog  	3. whipped → gegossen → lupfte  	4. goal → Ziel → Tor  	5. give → geben → verschaffen  	6. 2-0 → 2-20-20-Spiel → 2-0		**Explanation:**  	- "beschäftigt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "run"/"Sprint" from SRC/REF.	- "getrickst" in HYP is a mistranslation of "curled"/"zog" from SRC/REF.	- "gegossen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "whipped"/"lupfte" from SRC/REF.	- "Ziel" in HYP is a mistranslation of "goal"/"Tor" from SRC/REF.	- "geben" in HYP is a mistranslation of "give"/"verschaffen" from SRC/REF.	- "2-20-20-Spiel" in HYP is a mistranslation of the score "2-0"/"2-0" from SRC/REF.

She → Sie → Sie  	is → ist → hat  	on a roll → auf einer Rednerliste → einen Lauf  		**Explanation:** "auf einer Rednerliste" in HYP is a mistranslation of "on a roll"/"einen Lauf" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.
No translation errors detected.
Ort → Position → Position
Fury → Vorys → Rage  	Trampoline → Trampoline → Trampolins  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Fury" was mistranslated as "Vorys," which is incorrect. The more accurate translation should be "Rage" as in the REF.  	2. "Trampoline" in HYP is incorrectly in the plural form "Trampoline," whereas it should be the singular "Trampolins" to match the REF accurately.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation (HYP) appropriately conveys the meaning of the source sentence in context, despite variations in phrasing, and aligns similarly to the reference translation (REF).
events → Ereignisse → Veranstaltungen  	furious → wütend → rasender  	relay → [omitted] → Staffellauf  		**Explanation:**  	- "Ereignisse" in HYP mistranslates "events," which is better captured by "Veranstaltungen" in REF, considering the context of a structured event like the Olympics.	- "wütend" in HYP mistranslates "furious," which refers to a "relay" in REF, making "rasender" more appropriate for the implied intensity of the event.	- "relay" from SRC is omitted in HYP, while it's captured as "Staffellauf" in REF, significantly changing the structural meaning of the sentence.

1. **erstmals → Olympischer** → ersten Mal**  	   - "erstmals" means "first time," but "Olympischer" wrongly modifies it, which is not necessary.		2. **zerfallener → Herzblut → Frauenschwarm**  	   - "zerfallener Herzblut" is a mistranslation of "dimpled heartthrob," which should convey the idea of being attractive or appealing, similar to "Frauenschwarm mit Grübchen."		3. **Haushaltsnamen → bekannten Namen**  	   - "Haushaltsnamen" directly translates to "household names" but should convey the context of "known names," better expressed as "bekannten Namen."		4. **unter Beweis gestellt werden → gesendet werden**  	   - "unter Beweis gestellt werden" translates to "being demonstrated," but the context refers to being "broadcasted or aired" like in the REF.		5. **gekauft → aufgebaut**  	   - "gekauft" means "bought," which should contextually refer to "built up" by sponsorships, as "aufgebaut" indicates.		6. **fühlsreichen → Wohlfühl-TV-Werbung**  	   - "fühlsreichen" implies "emotional," but the context requires a term indicating "feel-good," such as "Wohlfühl."		7. **Zenter → Fechter**  	   - "Zenter" is a mistranslation of "fencer," which should be "Fechter."

trampoline → Trampoline → Trampolinspringen
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "mag" and "könnte" can translate "may," and there is no significant change in meaning in the translation from SRC to HYP compared to REF. Mistranslation is not evident in single-word terms here.
1. trampoline → Trampoline → Trampolinspringen  	2. advance → Athletenvorstoß → geschafft  		**Explanation:**  	- "Trampoline" in HYP is a partial mistranslation compared to "Trampolinspringen" in REF, which aligns with the SRC "trampoline," as it refers to the sport, not an object.	- "Athletenvorstoß" in HYP inadequately represents the meaning conveyed by "advance" in SRC and "geschafft" in REF, where the context is about athletes reaching a stage or round in a competition.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation aligns well with both the contextual and semantic meanings of the SRC and REF sentences. The differences between "aufzuteilen" (HYP) and "zu teilen" (REF) are minor and do not constitute a significant mistranslation in this context.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year. 		```No translation errors detected.``` 		**Explanation:** The words "von" and "aus" in both HYP and REF are interchangeable regarding expressing origin in this context. "Roe" in HYP seems to be a viable transliteration of "Rosie", considering the minor typographical variance, it does not alter the sentence's comprehension significantly for this specific error-check task.

Hoffnungen → Hoffende → Hoffende  	Gericht → Spielplatz → Spielplatz  		**Explanation:** "Hoffnungen" in HYP should be "Hoffende" to match the context of "Medal hopefuls".

finish line → Ziellinie → Ziellinie  	starting wall → Startmauer → Ausgangswand  	taunting line → Trennlinie → höhnisches Ziel  	record → Spuren → Rekords		**Explanation:**  	1. **"Trennlinie" in HYP is a mistranslation of "taunting line" from the SRC; it should be "höhnisches Ziel" as in REF.**  	2. **"Spuren" in HYP is a mistranslation of "record" from the SRC; it should be "Rekords" as in REF.**		The other comparisons (finish line, starting wall) did not reveal mistranslation errors, as they maintain the semantic integrity relative to the SRC and REF.

It → Zen → Es  	close → nahe → Zen  	Olympic → olympische → Olympischen  
women's → Frauen → Frauen  	endgültigen → Frauen → Endrunden  		**Explanation:** In the HYP sentence, "endgültigen Frauen" is a mistranslation in the context of "finals and qualifiers." The term "endgültigen" (which means "final" in a different context) should be "Endrunden." Other words translate accurately or closely enough to be acceptable variations.
NBC → BBC → NBC  	Finals → Finale → Endrunden  	Air → fliegen → ausstrahlen  
olympischen → olympischen → der Olympia  	Manias → Manias → Manie  	Allgemeinen → Allgemeinen → allgemeinen  	Melee → übersehen → Tumult  		**Explanation:** The mistranslations "olympischen" and "Manias" deviate significantly from the REF's "der Olympia" and "Manie," respectively. Additionally, "Allgemeinen" is an incorrect form compared to "allgemeinen" in REF. The term "Melee" is reflected incorrectly in "übersehen"; proper context should align with "Tumult" from REF.
consciousness raising → Bewusstsein → Bewusstseinssteigerung  	ogling → Gefecht → Angaffen  	objectification → Obdachlosigkeit → Objektifizierung  	gasps → absehbare → nach Luft ringende  	fan base → Fassade → Fangemeinde  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence provides an accurate translation of the given source sentence, and there are no noticeable single-word errors compared to the REF sentence. The word "long" is not translated in both HYP and REF, resulting in consistent translations.
Gewaltproteste → Gewalttätige Proteste → Gewalttätige Proteste  		**Explanation:** "Gewaltproteste" in HYP is a mistranslation of "violent protests" from SRC, where the correct translation should be "Gewalttätige Proteste" as per the REF, maintaining precise meaning and context.
political → politischen → politische  	violent → heftigen → gewalttätigen
Dutzende → zig → zig  	tödlich erschossen → getötet → getötet  		**Explanation:**  	- "Dutzende" in HYP translates as "dozens" while "zig" in REF is a more appropriate translation for "scores".  	- "tödlich erschossen" in HYP translates to "fatally shot", but "getötet" in REF properly captures the intended meaning of "been fatally shot".

No translation errors detected.
government → Regierung → Regierung  	response → Reaktion → Antwort  	human → Menschenrechtsgruppen → Menschenrechtsorganisationen  	ruthless → skrupellos → unbarmherzig  		**Explanation:**  	- "Reaktion" and "Antwort" are both translations of "response," though "Antwort" might be contextually more direct, both are acceptable.  	- "Menschenrechtsgruppen" and "Menschenrechtsorganisationen" are functionally equivalent in this context, so both can be used interchangeably without error.  	- "Regierung" and "Regierung" are consistent.  	- "Skrupellos" and "unbarmherzig" both translate "ruthless," with slight differences in connotation that do not necessarily change the overall meaning significantly in this context.  		**Overall:** No significant single-word translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and follows the REF translation closely. There are no significant single-word mistranslations that change the core meaning or context of the sentences.
whipping → stopfen → schlagen  	handstands → Handzeichen → Handstand  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence adequately represents the meaning of the SRC sentence, and there are no significant single-word mistranslations compared to the REF sentence. The variations between the translations involve synonyms or stylistic choices that do not impact the core meaning significantly.
schwierig → Fortschritte → zukünftig  	Projektleiter → Projektdirektor → Projektleiter  		**Explanation:**  	- "Fortschritte" in HYP is a mistranslation of the contextually more appropriate "zukünftig" in REF, changing the intended meaning regarding moving forward in time. 	- "Projektdirektor" in HYP should align with "Projektleiter" in REF as both roles typically refer to a project lead in such contexts.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The translation in the HYP sentence captures the meaning of the SRC sentence and aligns well with the REF sentence. Differences are minor and do not constitute clear mistranslations.
if → wenn → wenn  	country → Land → Länder  		**Explanation:**  	1. "wenn" in HYP inaccurately captures the conditional "if" usage in this context.	2. "Land" in HYP is singular, whereas "Länder" from SRC/REF correctly reflects the plural "countries".
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both HYP and REF accurately translate the meaning of the SRC sentence, although they use slightly different phrasing. "Wirtschaft" and "Äthiopiens" are correct translations for "Ethiopia's economy". The verb "entwickelt" in HYP and "expandierte" in REF both effectively convey the idea of "expanding". Additionally, "beeindruckend" in HYP and "im beachtlichen Tempo" in REF both suitably convey "at an impressive clip".
No translation errors detected.
in der Regel → typisch → typically  		**Explanation:** "Typisch" in HYP is a mistranslation of "typically"/"in der Regel" from SRC/REF, changing the intended meaning from "generally" to "typical."
No translation errors detected.
exiled → gejagt → Exil  	jailed → inhaftiert → Gefängnis  	reaches → entfernte → Weiten  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The hypothetical "Aber" in HYP can reasonably translate "But" from the SRC, and "kann" is a close translation of "may," considering slight tonal differences like "Doch" and "könnte" in REF. Both convey the possibility of change, aligning with the context.
man → die Menschen → Leute  	erstickt → erstickt → unterdrücken  		**Explanation:**  	1. "man" in HYP is a mistranslation of "people"/"Leute" from SRC/REF. The use of "man" implies a generic 'one' rather than 'people'.	2. "erstickt" (suffocate) in both HYP and REF doesn't align with "unterdrücken" (oppress) from REF, the latter being more contextually fit based on the SRC text.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
complaints → Beschwerden → Beschwerden  	many → viele → zahlreiche  	land → Land → Boden  	governing → Regierungskoalition → regierenden  	power → Machtstrang → Würgegriff in Bezug auf Macht  		**Explanation:** The machine-translated sentence ("HYP") and the reference sentence share several points of alignment, but there are notable differences that can affect the meaning:		1. "viele" ('many') is a simpler translation than "zahlreiche", which has a connotation of 'numerous.'	2. "Landnutzung" ('land use') differs from "Bodennutzung," which is more specific to 'ground use'.	3. "Machtstrang" ('power string') doesn't convey the same meaning as "Würgegriff in Bezug auf Macht" ('stranglehold regarding power') found in the REF, impacting the interpretation significantly.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The translation in HYP is contextually accurate and aligns with the meaning of both SRC and REF sentences. Variations such as "im vergangenen Jahr" vs. "letztes Jahr" or "heftig" vs. "weitläufig" do not significantly alter the meaning and are considered minor discrepancies.
jagged → gefesselten → zackige  		**Explanation:** "Gefesselten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "jagged"/"zackige" from SRC/REF, thus altering the description of the line and affecting the context and meaning.
vanquished → verschwunden → bezwungen
bitter → Geschwafel → Verbitterung
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The word choices "erste" and "scheinbar" in HYP compared to "erste" and "scheint" in REF do not significantly change the meaning and adequately translate from the SRC. Both translations accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
billigere → gemeinhin → immer häufiger  	da → wurden → sich  	Dienst → wurde → Dienste  		**Explanation:**  	1. "gemeinhin" in HYP (translated as "common") is used incorrectly where "immer häufiger" (translated as "more common") fits the context better.	2. "wurde" in HYP ("became") is incorrectly used here; the context requires "sich" (for improved), which refers back to "sich verbessern" as in REF.	3. "Dienst" in HYP (singular) fails to match the plurality "Dienste" as used in both the context and REF.
versperrt → versperrt → sperrt  	Stellvertreter → Stellvertreter → Proxies  		**Explanation:**  	- "versperrt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "sperrt", as "versperrt" implies full blocking whereas "sperrt" aligns better with partial or temporary access restrictions typical in such contexts.	- "Stellvertreter" is a mistranslation of "Proxies", which changes the technical context from internet proxies to representatives or deputies, significantly altering the meaning.
No translation errors detected.
Amharas → Aharas → Amharas  		**Explanation:** The word "Amharas" in the SRC and "Amharas" in the REF is incorrectly translated as "Aharas" in the HYP, which is a mistranslation likely due to a typographical error that changes the meaning.
allies → Verbündeten → Feinde
1. florierte → florierten → prosperierten	2. Moslems → Muslime → Muslime	3. Niederlandgebieten → Flachlandgebieten → Flachlandgebieten

Amharas → Aharas → Amharas  	Tigrayan → tigarischen → Tigray  		**Explanation:**  	- "Aharas" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Amharas," noticeable from SRC and the correct REF.	- "Tigarischen" in HYP does not correctly translate to "Tigrayan" or "Tigray," misrepresenting the ethnic group mentioned in SRC/REF.
loss → Verlust → Tod  
unoffenkundigen → nicht publik gemachten
considered → galt → wurde  	Genius → Genius → Genie  	see → herumsah → denken  		**Explanation:**  	- "Galt" is a mistranslation of "considered", where "wurde angesehen" or similar should be used for more accurate meaning.  	- "Genius" should be "Genie" to correctly translate the term in this context.  	- "Herumsah" implies physically looking around, whereas "denken" captures the metaphorical sense of "seeing around corners".
erfasst → versiert → versiert  	Emissionen → Sonderbeauftragte → Sonderbeauftragte  	massakrieren → bearbeiten → bearbeiten  	vertreiben → unschädlich zu machen → unschädlich zu machen

No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and aligns closely with the REF translation, given minor structural variations that do not constitute significant errors.
government → gestürzt → Regierung  		**Explanation:** The word "gestürzt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "bungled"/"verpfuscht" from SRC/REF. "Gestürzt" means "overthrown" in English, which changes the meaning contextually. The SRC and REF context implies that the government mishandled the election rather than overthrew it.
crackdown → scharfen Vorgehen → Razzien		**Explanation:** "scharfen Vorgehen" in HYP mistranslates "crackdown," which is better represented by "Razzien" in REF. "Scharfen Vorgehen" typically translates to a harsh approach rather than the specific context of "raids" or "crackdown."
commuter → Computer → Pendler
**No translation errors detected.**  		**Explanation:** The words in HYP align well with those in SRC and REF. The differences, such as "natürlich" (HYP) and "offensichtlich" (REF), or "innere Entrüstung" (HYP) versus "interne Missgunst" (REF), don't constitute mistranslations, as they do not significantly alter the meaning in context.
No translation errors detected.

No translation errors detected.
Trockenflüge → Dronenflüge → Dronenflüge  		**Explanation:** "Trockenflüge" in HYP is a mistranslation of "drone flights"/"Dronenflüge" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.

That → Das → Dies  	rope → Weg → Gratwanderung
Trump → Trumpp → Trump  	Founded → Stiftung → gegründet  	Claim → ISIS → Behauptung  	Claim → mit → gewesen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Trumpp" in HYP is a typographical error of "Trump" from SRC and REF.	2. "Stiftung" (foundation) in HYP does not correctly translate "Founded" from SRC, which is correctly translated as "gegründet" in REF.	3. "ISIS" is retained from SRC in HYP, whereas it should be interchanged with the word "Claim" (Behauptung) referring to the assertion, as reflected in REF.	4. "mit" (with) in HYP incorrectly translates the verb context "was" as "geworden" (the correct being "gewesen") in REF, portraying the claim context.
Trumpf → Trump → Trump  	ernst → ernst gemeint → ernst gemeint  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Trump" from SRC/REF, and "ernst" doesn't accurately convey "ernst gemeint" as in REF, changing the grammatical and context meaning.
**presidential nominee → Kandidat des republikanischen Präsidenten → Präsidentschaftskandidat der Republikaner**  		**Explanation:** "Kandidat des republikanischen Präsidenten" in HYP does not accurately convey "Republican presidential nominee" as "Präsidentschaftskandidat der Republikaner" does in the REF.
put → befand sich → bringt  	surrogates → Umgebung → Mitstreiter  
1. Zusammenkunft → Wahlkampfveranstaltung → rally  	2. verdoppelt → ruderte zurück → doubled down  	3. beabsichtige → nicht beabsichtigte → did intend
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	Sarkasmus → sarkastisch → sarkastisch  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" in the HYP is a mistranslation of "Trump" from SRC/REF, and "Sarkasmus" in HYP does not match "sarkastisch" from SRC/REF, altering the intended meaning.
post → Post → Tweet  	reversal → Umkehrung → Gegensatz  	charge → Anklage → Anschuldigung  		**Explanation:** "Post" in HYP mistranslates "post" from SRC, which contextually refers to "Tweet" as in REF. "Umkehrung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "reversal" from SRC, which is closer to "Gegensatz" as used in REF. Lastly, "Anklage" in HYP mistranslates "charge" from SRC, which in this context aligns more accurately with "Anschuldigung" as in REF. These errors significantly alter the meaning and context of the translation.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	Rundfunkveranstalter → Radiomoderator → Radiomoderator  	hätte → wollte → wollte  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Trumpf" in HYP is a mistranslation of Mr. Trump from SRC/REF.	2. "Rundfunkveranstalter" in HYP is not contextually fitting compared to "Radiomoderator" in REF.	3. "hätte" in HYP changes the meaning compared to "wollte" in REF.

Trump → Trumpf → Trump
Mrs. → Frau → Mrs.  	seine → ihre → ihre  
Trumpf → Trump → Trump  	benutzt → vorgebracht → vorgebracht  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Trump" from both SRC and REF. The word "benutzt" in HYP does not accurately capture the context or meaning of "vorgebracht" used in REF.
Russians → Russen → Russen  	hack → zerschlagen → hacken  		**Explanation:** "Zerschlagen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "hack" from SRC and corresponds to "hacken" in REF. Both "Russians" and "Russen" are correct translations.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	Reden → Reden → Grenzen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Trump" should remain as "Trump" in the translation and not change to "Trumpf."  	- The word "Reden" in HYP can be considered correct despite the REF using "sprachlichen Grenzen" since "Reden" refers to speech, not boundaries or limits. However, the phrase structure might be interpreted differently, so "Reden" can still be mentioned as it shifts the nuance from "Boundaries" to "Speeches" though both relate to "speech/political boundaries."
pattern → Muster → seiner Methoden  	Kommunikationsexperte → Kommunikationsexpertin → Kommunikationsexpertin
statements → vage → Aussagen  	lenses → Lizenzen → Art und Weise  		**Explanation:** "vage" in HYP was mistranslated instead of "Aussagen" in REF, and "Lizenzen" was incorrectly used for "lenses," which was contextually referred to as "Art und Weise" in REF.
poll numbers → Umfragen → Umfragewerte  	tumble → gescheitert → zurückgegangen  	caustic → kausaleren → ätzenderen  		**Explanation:** 	- "Umfragen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "poll numbers"/"Umfragewerte" from SRC/REF.	- "gescheitert" in HYP inaccurately translates "tumble"/"zurückgegangen" from SRC/REF.	- "kausaleren" in HYP mistranslates "caustic"/"ätzenderen" from SRC/REF, affecting the contextual meaning.

Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	accuses → beschuldigt → beschuldigt (No error in translation here)  		**Explanation:** The name "Trumpf" in the HYP is a mistranslation of "Trump" in the SRC and REF, which alters the proper name used. The translation of "accuses" to "beschuldigt" is accurate and consistent between HYP and REF in context.
Trump → Trumpf → Trumps
**SRC word → HYP word → Correct REF word**		surrogates → Schauplätzen → Fürsprechern  	Trump's → Trumpf → Trumps
Trump → Trumpf → Trumps
jayvee → Jayeve → Hinterbänkler  		**Explanation:** "Jayeve" in HYP is a mistranslation of "jayvee"/"Hinterbänkler" from SRC/REF, which reflects the intended metaphor used by Obama.
Clinton → Frau → Mrs.  	Hauptrepublikaner → Mainstream-Republikaner → Mainstream-Republikaner  	Staatssekretär → Außenministerin → Secretary of State  	  	**Explanation:**  	1. "Clinton" in HYP should be "Mrs." as in the REF for consistency with formal titles.  	2. "Hauptrepublikaner" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Mainstream-Republikaner" from REF. It changes the meaning.	3. "Staatssekretär" in HYP is incorrect as "Secretary of State" is translated as "Außenministerin" in REF, which aligns with the standard title in the political context.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	lash out → aufgespült → seine Angriffe  	news media → Nachrichtenmedien → die Medien  	harping → sein Wort → auf jedem seiner Worte herumzureiten  	biased → parteiische Haltung → gegen ihn voreingenommen

change → ändert → Veränderung
wiederbelebter → wiederbelebtes → wiederbelebtes  	im November letzten Jahres → letzten November → letzten November  		**Explanation:**  	1. "wiederbelebter" in HYP should match the gender and case as used for "wiederbelebtes" in REF, as it aligns with the noun "Cafe".	2. "im November letzten Jahres" in HYP is unnecessarily verbose and doesn't match the concise "letzten November" as used in REF.
unpretentious → unanmaßende → schlichte  	  	**Explanation:** "unanmaßende" in HYP is a mistranslation of "unpretentious"/"schlichte" from SRC/REF, altering the context and meaning.
No translation errors detected.
Leitet → wird geführt → Besitzer  	Ort → Ort → Cafés  		**Explanation:** The words "Leitet" and "Ort" in HYP do not align correctly with the more accurate translations in REF. "Leitet" in HYP should have been translated as "wird geführt" (which matches the implication of being an owner). "Ort" is technically correct for "place," but "Cafés" in REF provides a more specific and contextually appropriate meaning, as "Cafe" is the central subject discussed in both SRC and REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** "Verb" is treated as a proper noun in both HYP and REF. The sentences are contextually similar with no mistranslations of single words that change the determined meaning significantly.
customer → Kunde → Kunde  	offered → anbot → anbot  	bankroll → finanzieren → Geldmittel bereitstellen  	excited → aufgeregt → aufgeregt  	outpost → Außenposten → Außenstelle  		**Explanation:** Each word in HYP closely aligns with the corresponding meanings in both SRC and REF. Since all significant terms reflect the same meaning within context, the translations, despite variations such as synonyms or construction changes, adequately convey the source sentence's meaning.		Hence, based on the significant contextual details, no translation errors detected.

Nine → In → Nach  	months → Monaten → Monaten (correct translation, but contextual error with preposition identified above)  	old → alter → alten (correct translation, but contextual error further clarified below)  	regulars → Regelwerke → Stammkunden  		**Explanation:**		- "In" in HYP mistranslates "Nine" in SRC, where the correct translation reflects "Nach" as used in REF.	- "Regelwerke" in HYP mistranslates "regulars" from SRC, which should be "Stammkunden" as shown in REF.	- The errors with prepositions and the noun translation altered the entire contextual meaning, making them distinct mistranslations aligned with REF.
1. priced out → einen Preis bekommen → verdrängt  		**Explanation:** "Einen Preis bekommen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "priced out" from SRC, where the correct translation should be "verdrängt" as in REF, significantly changing the intended meaning in the context.
recent → letzten → kürzlich
Ms. → Herr → (no corresponding REF word indicating female)  	went to → war → besuchte
moved → Umzug → gezogen  	trek → Ball → Weg  
Verb → Schließung → Verb  	(Nachdem das Verb geschlossen hatte → Nach der Schließung von Verb)  		**Explanation:** "Schließung" in HYP is a mistranslation of the verbal "closed"/"geschlossen" from SRC/REF, altering the meaning.
I → Mir → Mir  	realized → klar geworden → klar wurde  	it → ich → es  	liked → liebe → gefiel  		**Explanation:**  	- "I" (SRC) should be translated to "Mir" (REF), but the verb structure in HYP results in grammatical and contextual errors, where "ich" mistakenly acts as the subject instead of "es".  	- "realized" (SRC) is translated incorrectly in terms of tense and structure; "klar geworden" does not adequately match "klar wurde" (REF) in the specific context.	- "it" (SRC) is mistranslated as "ich" (HYP) which incorrectly changes the subject.	- "liked" (SRC) should be "gefiel" (REF), but is mistranslated to a first-person "liebe" in HYP, altering the meaning significantly.
1. Rücken → dem Rücken → trinkt  	2. verschnittenen → verschnittenen → Blended  	3. Getränk → Getränk → Tea  		**Explanation:**  	- "dem Rücken" in HYP translates SRC's "back on" incorrectly; "trinkt" in the REF is a more accurate rendition of "back on" in context.	- "verschnittenen" is a mistranslation of "blended"; the REF uses the English term "Blended," maintaining the original context.	- "Getränk" is a less precise translation of "chai drink" where "Tea" is utilized in the REF for more specificity.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While the sentence structures are different, each word aligns contextually and conceptually between HYP and REF considering the SRC sentence. The discrepancies involve phrasing rather than single-word translation errors.
He'd go → Er sollte → Er ging  	order → anordnen → bestellte
Quarter → Viertel um → Viertel nach  	everything bagel → alles → Everything-Bagel
Mr. → Rodriguez → Rodriguez  	wanted → wolle → wollte  	experiment → versuchen → experimentieren  	ingredients → Inhaltsstoffe → Zutaten  		**Explanation:**  	- "Mr." is omitted in both HYP and REF, but given the context, "Rodriguez" alone can be justified.  	- "wanted" in SRC maps to "wolle" in HYP and "wollte" in REF; "wollte" is the correct past tense, aligning better with "wanted."  	- "experiment" in SRC translates to "versuchen" in HYP and "experimentieren" in REF; the latter is more faithful to the idea of "experimenting."  	- "ingredients" in SRC is translated to "Inhaltsstoffe" in HYP, but "Zutaten" in REF is the more common and contextually appropriate choice.
1. **order → Reihenfolge → Bestellung**  	2. **bacon → Back → Speck**  	3. **everything → allen → Everything**  	4. **switch things up → ausschalten → abwechseln**		**Explanation:**  	- "Reihenfolge" in HYP is a mistranslation of "order"/"Bestellung" from SRC/REF, slightly altering the meaning.  	- "Back" in HYP is likely a mistranslation of "bacon"/"Speck" from SRC/REF.  	- "allen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "everything"/"Everything" from SRC/REF, affecting the reference to the specific type of bagel.  	- "ausschalten" in HYP does not correctly convey the action of "switching things up" or "abwechseln," which means changing or alternating, altering the intended meaning.
hard feelings → großes Gefühl → Groll  	soap shop → Seifenladen → Seifengeschäft  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words used in HYP, compared to the SRC and REF, are adequately conveying the intended meaning, with no significant mistranslations affecting the context.
Ich glaube → Ich denke → Ich denke  	aufgreifen → auf ihr Angebot eingehen → auf ihr Angebot eingehen  		**Explanation:** In this context, "aufgreifen" is an incorrect translation of "take them up on it," which should be "auf ihr Angebot eingehen" as shown in REF. Additionally, "Ich glaube" can be seen as a less accurate translation of "I think," compared to "Ich denke" used in REF.
Greenpoint → Greenpoints → Greenpoint  	cafe → Schutzschild → Café  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Greenpoint" in SRC should match "Greenpoints" in REF to show proper possessive form in German.	2. "cafe" from SRC is mistranslated as "Schutzschild" in HYP, fundamentally changing the meaning. "Café" in REF is the correct translation.
Ort → Ort → Stelle  		**Explanation:** "Ort" in HYP, while technically correct, does not convey the nuance of "spot" as "Stelle" does in this context. The REF uses "Stelle," which better captures the intended meaning from the SRC sentence.
No translation errors detected.
local juice spot → örtlicher Saft → örtliches Saftlokal  	cold-brewed → kalten → kaltgebrühten  	bottle → abflaschen → ins Flaschen füllen
cafe → Fahrzeug → Café  	adjacent → angrenzenden → benachbartes  	expand → ausbreitet → expandiert  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The sentences in HYP and REF convey the same meaning. Minor synonym variations such as "erhalten" and "bekommen" both adequately translate "to get" from SRC, thus no significant single-word translation errors are present.
Whitt → Witt → Witt  	regular → regelmäßig → Stammkunde  	heartbroken → zerbrochen → am Boden zerstört  	they → sie → das Café  		**Explanation:**  	- "Whitt" in SRC should be translated as "Witt" based on the REF.  	- "regular" in the context of a frequent customer is mistranslated as "regelmäßig" (routine) in HYP, rather than "Stammkunde" in REF.  	- "heartbroken" is mistranslated as "zerbrochen" (broken) instead of "am Boden zerstört" (heartbroken) used in REF.  	- "they" is incorrectly translated as "sie" (they) instead of "das Café" (the café) which provides the right context in REF.
new space → neuer Raum → neue Café  	walking in → einmarschierte → Betreten des Lokals  	getting → bekam → Bestellen einer  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Neuer Raum" (new room) in HYP does not align with the more contextually appropriate "neue Café" (new cafe) in REF; "space" is often contextually understood as such.	2. "Einmarschierte" (marched in) in HYP does not match the more neutral and accurate "Betreten des Lokals" (entering the cafe) in REF.	3. "Bekam" (got/received) in HYP is best translated in this context as "Bestellen einer" (ordering a), better fitting the scenario described in REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately matches the meaning of the SRC sentence and aligns properly with the REF translation. There are no mistranslations of individual words.

ascending → Erscheinen → Aufstieg  	presidency → Präsidentschaft → Präsidenten  		**Explanation:**  	- "Erscheinen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "ascending"/"Aufstieg" from SRC/REF, which changes the intended action.  	- "Präsidentschaft" in HYP does not correctly convey the nuance of "presidency" being a role held by "President"/"Präsidenten".
1. fancy → schmerzhafte → raffinierte  	2. foods → Lebensmittel → Delikatessen  	3. terrapin → Terrapin → Wasserschildkröte  		**Explanation:** In the HYP, "schmerzhafte" (painful) is a mistranslation of "fancy" from the SRC and "raffinierte" from the REF. "Lebensmittel" (foods/groceries) in HYP is a mistranslation for "foods" with a less sophisticated connotation than "Delikatessen" (delicacies) used in the REF. "Terrapin" is directly borrowed into HYP, but "Wasserschildkröte" (turtle) is used in REF, implying a more culturally adjusted term in the REF.
deviled eggs → Drahtzieher → gefüllte Eier  	tomato sauce → Tomatensäure → Tomatensauce  	mashed potatoes → zerrissene Kartoffeln → Kartoffelpüree  	dessert → Wüstenstaub → Dessert  	prune pudding → Rintwein → Pflaumenpudding

couple → Paare → Ehepaar
Ziegelman → Frau Ziegelman → Ziegelman  	Festhalten → Wohnhaus → tenement  	Unteren → Lower → Lower
Square Meal → Platz Mal → anständige Mahlzeit  	food → Lebensmittel → Küche  		**Explanation:** "Platz Mal" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Square Meal"/"anständige Mahlzeit" from SRC/REF, and "Lebensmittel" in HYP does not accurately convey "food"/"Küche" in the context of the SRC and REF, significantly altering the intended meaning.
Flatiron → Flatron → Flatiron  	lunch → Mittagsplatz → Imbiss  	crash → Unglücks → Börsencrash  
1. cream → Käse → Frischkäse  	2. chopped → gepumpten → Olivenstückchen  	3. sandwich → Olivensandwich → Sandwich  	4. turkey → Truthülse → Truthahn  	5. mashed → zerrissene → Kartoffelpüree  	6. vegetable → pflanzliche → Gemüse  	7. medley → Medaille → Mischung  		**Explanation:** Each word in HYP that was flagged represents a mistranslation from the SRC to HYP when compared to the more correct REF, substantially altering the meaning and context of the sentence.
reporter → Berichterstatter → Reporter  	meatloaf → Fleisch → Hackbraten  
loaves → Liebe → Lebensmittel
peanut → Peantenlaib → Erdnussbrot  	loaf → Sojabohnen → Bohnenbrot  		**Explanation:**  	"Peantenlaib" in HYP is a mistranslation of "peanut"/"Erdnussbrot" from SRC/REF. "Sojabohnen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "bean loaf"/"Bohnenbrot" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context. "Leberfrei" in HYP should arguably translate to something more akin to "Leberkäse" given the context of loafs, but within single-word scope, the errors listed highlight critical misinterpretation.
ingredient → Inhaltsstoff → Zutat  	thing → Ware → etwas  		**Explanation:** "Inhaltsstoff" in HYP mistranslates "ingredient"/"Zutat", and "Ware" does not accurately convey the meaning of "thing"/"etwas" in the SRC/REF sentences, significantly altering the intended meaning.
peanuts → Peanuts → Erdnüsse  	zu essen, um zu essen → um zu essen → dass sie ihnen als Abendessen dienen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Peanuts" in HYP should be "Erdnüsse" as in REF to accurately translate "peanuts" from SRC.  	2. The phrase "zu essen, um zu essen" in HYP does not convey the conditional meaning present in REF ("dass sie ihnen als Abendessen dienen"), which aligns with "to serve as your dinner" in SRC.

Depression → Depression → Großen Depression  	Tisch → Tisch → Tisch in einem amerikanischen Haushalt  	allumfassender → allumfassender → All-You-Can-Eat  	Puffer → Puffer → Buffet  
farmworkers → Bauern → Feldarbeiter  	fresh-baked pie → frisch gekleidet → frisch gebackene Pastete  		**Explanation:**  	The word "Bauern" in HYP is a mistranslation of "farmworkers"/"Feldarbeiter" from SRC/REF, altering the specific type of worker mentioned.  	The phrase "frisch gekleidet" in HYP is a mistranslation of "fresh-baked pie"/"frisch gebackene Pastete" from SRC/REF, completely changing the meaning and context.

No translation errors detected.
meal → Tiermehls → Küche  		**Explanation:** “Tiermehls” in HYP is a mistranslation of "meal"/"Küche" from SRC/REF, as it translates to "animal meal," which doesn't fit the context.
mashups → Maschinen → Mischungen  	caloric → kalorische → kalorienreiche  	kitchen → Küchensinn → Küchenverstand  		**Explanation:** "Maschinen" (machines) is a mistranslation of "mashups" (Mischungen), "kalorische" (caloric) should be "kalorienreiche" (calorie-rich), and "Küchensinn" (kitchen sense) should be "Küchenverstand" (kitchen intelligence/sense) in this context, as the reference correctly captures.
Zwiebeln → Konotion → Zwiebeln  	Erdnussbutter → Peanut-Butter → Erdnussbutter  		**Explanation:** "Konotion" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Zwiebeln" related to "onion" from SRC/REF, and "Peanut-Butter" in HYP is a direct borrowing which should be "Erdnussbutter" as in the REF, considering the context.
addition → Ergänzung → Zusatz  	dinner → Abendessen → Mittagstsich  		**Explanation:** "Ergänzung" and "Abendessen" in HYP are mistranslations for the context provided by SRC/REF, where "Zusatz" and "Mittagstisch" are more appropriate.

praise → lobte → lobte  	Iowa farmhouse cooking → Bauernkochen von Iowa → Iowa Bauernhausküche  	dined → befand er sich → speiste  	millionaire sophisticate → millionäre Komplex → millionenschwere Mann von Welt  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Bauernkochen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Iowa farmhouse cooking"/"Iowa Bauernhausküche" from SRC/REF, not adequately capturing the "farmhouse" culinary style context.	2. "befand er sich" in HYP is not the correct translation for "dined"/"speiste" from SRC/REF, altering the meaning of the sentence.	3. "millionäre Komplex" in HYP is a mistranslation of "millionaire sophisticate"/"millionenschwere Mann von Welt," which misrepresents the context of having become sophisticated.

ermutigt → aufgefordert → aufgefordert
Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring → Frau Roosevelts Anheuerung eines Haushaltspersonals → Frau Roosevelt das Anheuern einer Haushälterin  	flavor → Flackfleisch → Geschmacksrichtungen  		**Explanation:** "Frau Roosevelts Anheuerung eines Haushaltspersonals" in HYP misrepresents the meaning from SRC and REF, where "Haushälterin" is a more precise translation than "Haushaltspersonals." Also, "Flackfleisch" is an incorrect translation for "flavor," which should be "Geschmacksrichtungen."
Depression-era → Depressionszeit → Großen Depression
Ziegelman → Frau Ziegelman → Ziegelman  	Nahrung → Ernährung → Nahrung  	Kochen → Kochen → Nahrungsmittel  		**Explanation:** "Frau Ziegelman" in HYP adds unnecessary specification not present in SRC or REF.

cream-puff → Schampfunfall → Windbeutelvorfall
plates → Teller → Teller  	desert → Wüste → Dessert  	prune → prine → Pflaumendessert  	lunch → Mittagessen → zu Mittag  		**Explanation:**  	- "Wüste" in HYP translates to "desert" but should be "Dessert" as the context describes a food item prepared for eating.  	- "prine" in HYP seems like an error or typo for "Pflaumendessert," which matches the REF accurately.  	- "Mittagessen" in HYP translates as "lunch," which in context needs to convey "zu Mittag" as in eating, like the REF.  		No errors related to "plates" were identified as the mismatch seems to be a function of sentence parsing rather than word meaning.
1. called → so genannte → wird genannt  	2. prune whip → pune pip → Prune Whip  	3. adding → der hinzufügte → und fügte hinzu  	4. common → gemeinsamen → üblicher  	5. snazzy → faulen → schicken

No translation errors detected.
Mr. → Herr → [No reference word]  	seconds → Sekunden → Nachschlag  	thirds → Drittel → Nachschlag  		**Explanation:** "Herr" in HYP is an unnecessary addition as "Mr." is not directly translated in REF. "Sekunden" and "Drittel" are literal and incorrect translations of "seconds" and "thirds" in the context of the sentence, where "Nachschlag" correctly conveys the idea of having more servings (i.e., seconds and thirds).
Sounding → klang → Wie  	can-do budgeter → Kanonenhaushalter → Can-Do-Budgetierer  	chopped → gekoppelte → gehackte  	walnuts → Wale → Walnüsse  
Killed → getötet → getötet  	bomb attack → Bombenanschlag → Bomben-Angriff  	hero → Helden → Held  		**Explanation:**  	- "Helden" in HYP is the plural or genitive form and incorrectly matches the singular "hero"/"Held" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning.

30-year-old → der 30-jährige → der 30-Jährige  	killed → Opfer → gestorben  	barrel → Barrel → Fass  	bomb → Bombenanschlags → Bomben-Angriff  		**Explanation:**   	1. "der 30-jährige" in HYP lacks capitalization compared to "der 30-Jährige" in REF, but it is a minor typographical discrepancy.	2. "Opfer" in HYP (victim) does not convey the intended meaning of "gestorben" (died/killed) from SRC and REF.	3. "Barrel" in HYP is an untranslated loanword, whereas "Fass" in REF is the appropriate German term.	4. "Bombenanschlags" in HYP means "bomb attack," while "Bomben-Angriff" in REF is more consistent with the SRC context. Each discrepancy here changes the meaning or reflects an improper translation of terms related to weaponry.
Bild → Zeitungszeitung → Bild-Zeitung  	Zivilschutzgruppe → Katastrophenschutzgruppe → Zivilschutzgruppe
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
Kleinkinds → Säuglings → Säuglings  	Ruinen → Trümmern → Trümmern  	gelaufen → ging → ging  		**Explanation:** "Kleinkinds" does not accurately capture "Säuglings" as per the reference, changing the specificity of what is being described. "Ruinen" does not match "Trümmern," which is a more contextually appropriate word here as per the SRC and REF. "Gelaufen" is stylistically different from "ging" indicating a tension in action timing or outcome conveyed in the REF.
Syrian → Syrien → Syrer  	glowing → erbarmungslosen → leuchtenden  	figurehead → Zahlenvertreter → Symbolfigur
saying → und sagte → sagte laut Bild

No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence effectively conveys the same meaning as the SRC sentence, and the differences with REF are minor or stylistic, which do not constitute significant translation errors of individual words.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation effectively conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence and aligns well with the REF translation. Even though there are slight variations in phrasing, no single word significantly deviates in meaning to constitute a translation error.
Wirbelfärbe → Wirbeltier
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
examination → Prüfung → Untersuchung
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence conveys the same meaning as both the SRC and REF sentences. The translations are contextually accurate without any single-word mistranslations altering the intended message.
sharks → Haie → Grönlandhaie  	birth → gebären → bekommen  	young → junge Menschen → Nachwuchs  
Greenland sharks → Grönland → Grönlandhai  	leisurely → rasch → Gemächlich  
km / h → ausfüllen → beschleunigt  	Robben → Robben → Robbe  		**Explanation:**  	1. "ausfüllen" in HYP is a mistranslation of the action being described in SRC and REF, where "beschleunigt" (accelerate) is more contextually correct compared to "to fill up".	2. "Robben" in HYP should be singular "Robbe" to match the singular form in SRC and REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The differences between HYP and REF are due to variations in expression rather than clear mistranslations of single words. Both adequately convey the meaning of the source sentence.
1. (shark → Grönlandhai → Grönlandhai) No error. The translation for "shark" to "Grönlandhai" is correct in context, though the determiner must reflect the gender of the noun: "ein" should be "einem" for grammatical accuracy.	2. ("a Greenland shark" → "ein Grönlandhai" → "ein Grönlandhai") No error in the translation. Correct translation regarding the meaning.	3. The closer attention should be on context and determiners; however, based on the task, the focus is on individual translation errors. Nevertheless, in a linguistic perspective, "ein Grönlandhai" should be corrected to "einem Grönlandhai" to ensure grammatical accuracy:		There are no specific single-word translation errors detected that significantly alter the sentence's meaning, aside from minor grammatical ones.		**Conclusion:**  	No translation errors detected. (Excluding grammatical considerations like "ein" to "einem", which are beyond the scope of single-word lexical translation errors.)
Alexander Scheuerlein → Alexander Scheulelin → Alexander Scheuerlein  	Instititute → Institute → Institut  	Lebensdauer → Lebensspanne → Lebensspanne  	Weltrekorde → Weltrekord → Weltrekord  	Wirbeltaten → Wirbeltiere → Wirbeltiere  
Evolutionsbiologen → Evolutionsbiologe → Evolutionsbiologe  	grönländische → Grönlandhaie → Grönlandhaie  		**Explanation:** "Evolutionsbiologen" in HYP is a mistranslation of the singular "Evolutionsbiologe" in REF, and "grönländische Haie" in HYP does not match the specific "Grönlandhaie" in REF. The plural form and incorrect translation change the meaning.
No translation errors detected.
It → Grönische → Grönlandhaie  	ocean → [not translated] → Eismeer  		**Explanation:** "Grönische" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Greenland sharks" which should be "Grönlandhaie" as per SRC and REF. Additionally, "ocean" is not directly translated in HYP, whereas it is translated as "Eismeer" in REF.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence closely aligns with the SRC sentence in terms of meaning and does not contain significant mistranslations when compared to the REF. The translations reflect the same information about the timing and preference for water temperature.
No translation errors detected.
slow → Langsamkeit → Zeitlupentempo  	researchers → Forschern → sie  	Svalbard → Svalard → Spitzbergen  	tracker → Fahrern → Sender  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Langsamkeit" (HYP) translates to "slowness," which is incorrect compared to "Zeitlupentempo" (slow speed) in REF.	2. "Forschern" (HYP) is a mistranslation of "they" compared to the REF "sie," which fits the English context.	3. "Svalard" (HYP) is a misspelling and incorrect, compared to "Spitzbergen" in REF which is the correct translation for "Svalbard."	4. "Fahrern" (HYP) incorrectly translates as "drivers" instead of the intended "tracker" from SRC, with "Sender" appropriately used in REF.
However → jedoch → trotzdem  	stomach → Magen → Magen  	seal → Robbens → Robbe  	jawbone → Jawbogen → Kieferknochen  	gobbled → niedergerissen → geschluckt  		**Explanation:**  	1. "jedoch" in HYP is different from "trotzdem" in REF, translating "however."	2. "Robbens" in HYP should be "Robbe" to correctly translate "seal."	3. "Jawbogen" is not a valid translation and should be "Kieferknochen" for "jawbone."	4. "niedergerissen" is a mistranslation for "gobbled," which should be "geschluckt."

eye's lens → Augenblicks → Augenlinse  	core → Kern → Zentrum  	shark → Hais → Haie  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Augenblicks" in HYP is a mistranslation for "eye's lens"/"Augenlinse" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning to "moment" instead of the intended context related to the eye.	2. "Kern" (core) in HYP matches "Kern" from SRC but does not match "Zentrum" in REF. While both words might serve similar purposes in other contexts, here, it is distinct from the intended translation in REF.	3. "Hais" in HYP is singular, while the REF uses the plural "Haie" which better matches the intended plural sense in the context of the sentence.
high levels → CO2-14-Ausstoß → Kohlenstoff-14  	lens cores → Liegenschildern → Linsenkern  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both HYP and REF provide accurate and contextually appropriate translations of the SRC sentence, with no significant single-word translation discrepancies. Any differences are minor and do not alter the intended meaning.
Lupen → Linsenkern → Linsenkern  	kleinsten → drittkleinsten → drittkleinsten  	hatten → gefeiert haben → gefeiert haben  		**Explanation:**  	- "Lupen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "lens cores"/"Linsenkern" from SRC/REF.	- "kleinsten" in HYP does not match "third-smallest"/"drittkleinsten" from SRC/REF.	- "hatten" in HYP inaccurately translates the intended celebration "gefeiert haben" from REF.
carbon-14 → Kohlenwasserstoff-14 → Kohlenstoff-14  	lens cores → Lenkungszentren → Linsenkern
carbon-14 → Kohlendioxid-14 → Kohlenstoff-14  	monitor → Überwacher → Uhr  	record-holding → Plattenhai → Rekord-Hai  		**Explanation:**  	- "Kohlendioxid-14" in HYP is a mistranslation of "carbon-14"/"Kohlenstoff-14" from SRC/REF, altering the meaning as they refer to different substances.	- "Überwacher" in HYP is an incorrect translation of "monitor"/"Uhr" from SRC/REF, changing the device's context.	- "Plattenhai" in HYP does not correspond meaningfully to "record-holding"/"Rekord-Hai" from SRC/REF, as the translation changes the intended meaning related to the record held by the shark.
female → Haie → Weibchen  	offspring → Nachkommen → Nachwuchs
length → Länge → Länge  	age → hohe Alter → Alter  		**Explanation:**  	- "Länge" is correctly translated in both HYP and REF, so there is no error here.  	- "hohe Alter" in HYP is a mistranslation as it means "old age" while "age" or simply "Alter" is intended by the SRC and correctly translated in the REF.
1. sexual → sexuellen → Geschlechts  	2. reproduce → reproduzieren → Vermehrung
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence matches the meaning of the SRC. Although "Methuselahs" is translated differently ("Methuselahs" in HYP vs "Methusaleme" in REF), it is a name and doesn't alter the meaning. Similarly, "Eisgewässern" in HYP and "eisigen Gewässern" in REF adequately convey the concept of "icy waters." There are no single-word errors significantly affecting the meaning.
- previous → frühere → bisherige	- 211-year-old → 21-jähriger → 211 Jahre alter	- harpoon tip → Hafentip → Harpunenspitze	- caught → erwischt → gefangen		**Explanation:**  	- "frühere" does not accurately capture the sense of "previous" as "bisherige" does.	- "21-jähriger" is a significant reduction in age compared to the correct "211 Jahre alter."	- "Hafentip" is unrelated to "harpoon tip" which should be "Harpunenspitze."	- "erwischt" gives a sense of being caught in the act, whereas "gefangen" accurately reflects the context of being caught as in captured.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation captures the overall meaning and context of the SRC sentence. Although the REF uses different phrasing and words, the HYP is not contextually or semantically incorrect compared to the SRC.
mature → alt sind → altern
No translation errors detected.
Volume → Volumen → Volumen  	increases → ansteigt → wächst  	surface area → Oberflächenfläche → Oberfläche  	radiates → strahlt → einbüßt  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Volume" is correctly translated as "Volumen" in both HYP and REF, so no error here.	2. "Increases" in SRC is translated as "ansteigt" in HYP and "wächst" in REF. Both are accurate translations, reflecting the meaning, so no single-word error.	3. "Surface area" is translated as "Oberflächenfläche" in HYP and "Oberfläche" in REF. "Oberflächenfläche" is a tautological error ("surface surface") and not commonly used in German.	4. "Radiates" is translated as "strahlt" in HYP and "einbüßt" in REF. "Straht" means to emit, which misconveys the original intent compared to "einbüßt", which reflects a heat loss concept more accurately.		Note: Based on error identification guidelines, "Oberflächenfläche" is identified here despite including a double-word formation due to its abnormal use in German.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP accurately translates the meaning of the SRC sentence, aligning well with the REF translation, albeit with a slightly different structure. The core components and meanings are intact, with no significant mistranslation errors.

No translation errors detected.
Construction → Teppich → Baugrund  	twinpack → Teppich → Doppelpack  		**Explanation:** "Teppich" in the HYP is a mistranslation for both "Construction" and "twinpack"/"Doppelpack," which changes the meaning and context of the sentence.

construction sites → Baustellen → Bauflächen  	residential commune → Heimat → Wohngemeinde  	older people → ältere Menschen → rüstige Senioren  		**Explanation:** "Baustellen" is a mistranslation of "construction sites"/"Bauflächen", "Heimat" does not accurately represent "residential commune"/"Wohngemeinde", and "ältere Menschen" does not fully capture the intended "older people"/"rüstige Senioren".
1. people → Menschen → Bauwillige  	2. prepared → bereit → Bauwillige  	3. apply → gelten → melden  	4. town hall → Stadtverwaltung → Rathaus  	5. plots → Plattformen → Parzellen  	6. giving out → Bereitstellung → Vergabe  		**Explanation:**  	- "Menschen" and "bereit" in HYP do not accurately translate the intended meaning of "people prepared"/"Bauwillige" in SRC/REF.	- "gelten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "apply"/"melden" from SRC/REF.	- "Stadtverwaltung" in HYP is incorrect for "town hall"/"Rathaus" from SRC/REF.	- "Plattformen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "plots"/"Parzellen" from SRC/REF.	- "Bereitstellung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "giving out"/"Vergabe" from SRC/REF.
movement → Verbringung → Ansiedelung  	space → Weltraum → Flächen  
business area → Geschäftsbereich → Gewerbegebiet  	marked out → ausgezeichnet → ausgewiesene  	plots → Teppiche → Parzellen  		**Explanation:** "Geschäftsbereich" is a mistranslation of "business area"/"Gewerbegebiet," "ausgezeichnet" is incorrectly translated instead of "marked out"/"ausgewiesene," and "Teppiche" (meaning carpets) is a mistranslation for "plots"/"Parzellen." These changes significantly alter the intended meaning and context.

No translation errors detected.
likely → höchstwahrscheinlich → wahrscheinlich  	specialist → Fachgebiet → Kompetenzfeld  	Real Estate → Real Estate → Immobilienmärkte  		**Explanation:** "Höchstwahrscheinlich" in HYP is an overtranslation/stronger term compared to "wahrscheinlich" in REF. "Fachgebiet" in HYP is a mistranslation for "Kompetenzfeld" in REF, misleading the context slightly. "Real Estate" in HYP is an untranslated term, whereas "Immobilienmärkte" in REF correctly translates the term.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence closely aligns with the meaning and context of the SRC sentence, with variations that are acceptable and do not significantly alter the meaning.

Registration → Zulassung → Registration
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
Main → Fluss → Main  		**Explanation:** "Fluss" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Main" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context as the original refers to the river as a location rather than identifying it as "the river" itself.
1. headquarters → Sitz → spreche		**Explanation:** In this case, "Sitz" in HYP is a mistranslation of "headquarters". While the REF uses "spreche" (a longer structure suggesting a positive aspect for Frankfurt), the HYP incorrectly identifies "Sitz" as the translation for "headquarters".
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence correctly translates the meaning of the SRC sentence. Both HYP and REF accurately convey the content about the OECD headquarters in Paris being less important for the financial sector than the ECB. The differences between HYP and REF are mainly in phrase structure rather than in meaning or single-word translations.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The translation into German correctly captures the meaning of the source sentence. Both HYP and REF convey the sense of Luxembourg having a significant funds industry like Dublin but facing challenges with infrastructure. The differences are stylistic or involve synonyms, which do not constitute clear errors.
No translation errors detected.
business properties → Geschäftseigenschaften → Gewerbeimmobilien
easy → einfach → einfach  	vacant → unbesetzte → freie  		**Explanation:** "unbesetzte" in HYP is a mistranslation compared to "freie" in REF for "vacant" from SRC. Both "allzu" in HYP and "gar nicht so" in REF translate "not all that," but do not perfectly match; however, the usage here is contextually minor.
Rents → Renten → Mieten  	business properties → Spitzengeschäfte → Gewerbeimmobilien  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation captures the meaning and essence of the SRC sentence accurately, using appropriate German translations that are contextually similar to those in the REF translation.

No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation captures the meaning of the SRC sentence accurately, and the differences with REF are mostly stylistic or synonymous, like "Präferenz" vs. "Vorlieben", "Finanzknotenpunkt" vs. "Finanzstandort", none of which significantly change the meaning.

Gilead → Gilad → Gilead  	attorney fees → Gebühren → Rechtskosten  	fight → Bekämpfung → Streit
attorney → Anzeigegebühren → Rechtskosten  	drugmaker → Drogenmacher → Pharmaunternehmen  		**Explanation:** "Anzeigegebühren" in HYP is a mistranslation of "attorney fees"/"Rechtskosten" from SRC/REF, and "Drogenmacher" in HYP is a mistranslation of "drugmaker"/"Pharmaunternehmen" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.
Merck → Merck → Mercks  	liegt → liegt → einschließlich des Meineides
Gilead → Gilad → Gilead  	Akte → Akte → Erhebung
Gilead → Gilad → Gilead  	dominates → dominiert → beherrscht  		**Explanation:** "Gilad" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Gilead" from SRC/REF, and "dominiert" is a less suitable translation for "dominates," where "beherrscht" from REF more accurately captures the intended meaning in context.
Gilead → Gilad → Gilead  	sofosbuvir → Softbover → Sofosbuvir  	Drogen → Drogen → Medikamenten  		**Explanation:** "Gilad" should be "Gilead," and "Softbover" is a mistranslation of "sofosbuvir." In the context, "Drogen" translates to "drugs" in a different sense relevant to illicit substances, whereas "Medikamenten" is the correct term in this medical context.
U.S. → US-gestützte → Von den USA unterstützte  	forces → Streitkräfte → Truppen  	seized full control → volle Kontrolle übernommen → vollständige Kontrolle zurückerobert  	from → aus → vom
fighters → Kämpfer → IS-Kämpfer  	left → linken → verlassen  	spoken → gesprochen → sagte
1. sweeping → überflutet → durchkämmen  	2. militants → Menschen → Kämpfer  		**Explanation:**  	- "überflutet" (flooded) in HYP is a mistranslation of "sweeping"/"durchkämmen" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning significantly.	- "Menschen" (people) in HYP is a mistranslation of "militants"/"Kämpfer" from SRC/REF, affecting the intended context.
held → festgehalten → gehalten  	Military Council → Militärrat des SDF, der Manbij Rat → Manbij Militärrats  		**Explanation:** "festgehalten" in HYP is a mistranslation, as the REF suggests "gehalten" fits better in the specific context of the hostages being held. Additionally, "Militärrat des SDF, der Manbij Rat" in HYP is an incorrect translation of "Manbij Militärrats" from REF, which denotes the specific name and structure of the council. These differences change the understanding of who is responsible for the action or what the action entails. However, it is important to note that multi-word spans like council names are often complex to translate and involve multiple words, but they are critical to meaning.
control → Kontrolle → Kontrolle  	sweeping → durchgreifende → Aufräumarbeiten  		**Explanation:** "Kontrolle" in HYP corresponds correctly to "control" in SRC and REF, hence no error there. However, "durchgreifende" in HYP translates "sweeping" from SRC but mismatches "Aufräumarbeiten" in REF, indicating a change in meaning.
earned → verdiente → verdienen  	paid → zahlte → zahlen  		**Explanation:** "verdiente" and "zahlte" in HYP are mistranslations of "earn"/"verdienen" and "pay"/"zahlen" from SRC/REF because the subject is plural "Clintons," requiring the verbs to be in plural form.
returns → Steuerrückflüsse → Steuererklärung  	federal → föderalen → Bundes  		**Explanation:**  	- "Steuerrückflüsse" in HYP is a mistranslation of "returns" from SRC, where the REF correctly uses "Steuererklärung," meaning tax return in the intended context.	- "föderalen" in HYP does not accurately translate "federal" from SRC in this context, where "Bundes" as used in the REF is more appropriate for "federal" tax rate.
Clintons → Clinton → Clintons  	Sprachgebühren → Redehonoraren → Redehonoraren  	Staatssekretärin → Außenministerin → Außenministerin  	im → über → über  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Clinton" in HYP is incorrect as it should be "Clintons" to reflect multiple individuals.	2. "Sprachgebühren" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Redehonoraren" from REF, which changes the context from "speaking fees" to a more general "language fees."	3. "Staatssekretärin" is distinctly incorrect since "Außenministerin" (Foreign Minister/Secretary of State) is specifically required.	4. "im" in HYP ("in the") does not correctly convey the context of "über" ("about") in SRC and REF related to the book.
Senator → N/A → Kandidat für die Vizepräsidentschaft  	Steuererträge → Steuererklärungen → Steuererklärungen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Senator" in HYP is a mistranslation when compared to the more specific "Kandidat für die Vizepräsidentschaft" in the REF, which is closer to the meaning in SRC.	- "Steuererträge" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Steuererklärungen," as "returns" refers to tax return documents, not revenues or yields, which aligns with SRC "tax returns."
federal → föderalen → Bundes  		**Explanation:** "Föderalen" in HYP is not the most accurate translation for "federal," as "Bundes" better fits the context in German, according to REF.
Clinton campaign aide → Clinton → Clintons Kampagnenhelferin  	Jennifer Palmieri → Jennifer Palmini → Jennifer Palmieri  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Clinton" in HYP does not correctly translate "Clinton campaign aide" from SRC; the REF clarifies that it should be "Clintons Kampagnenhelferin."  	2. "Jennifer Palmieri" from SRC is mistranslated as "Jennifer Palmini" in HYP whereas it should remain as "Jennifer Palmieri" as in the REF.
Trumpf → Trump → Trump  	Steuererträge → Steuererklärungen → Steuererklärungen  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Trump"/"Trump" from SRC/REF, and "Steuererträge" is a mistranslation of "Steuererklärungen"/"Steuererklärungen", significantly changing the meaning and context.
U.S. → [Omitted in HYP] → US  	tax returns → Steuererträge → Steuererklärungen
Internal Revenue Service → Internen Einkommens → Steuerbehörden
Your move → Ihr Bewegung → Sie sind am Zug  	linking → in Verbindung → in Bezug
Trump → Trumppe → Trumps  	release → Freilassung → veröffentlichen  	audits → Prüfungen → Steuerprüfungen  
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately reflects the meaning of the SRC sentence and aligns well with the REF translation. While there are variations in phrasing, both HYP and REF capture the essential elements and context of the original English sentence, without any significant mistranslations of single words.
Clinton → Clinton → Clinton  	pounced → hingewiesen → gestürzt  	issue → Thema → Thema  	releasing → veröffentlicht → veröffentlicht  	online video → Online-Video → Video im Internet  	high-profile → hochkarätigen → hochranginge  	urging → nahe gelegt wird → auffordern  	Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	release → Freigabe → veröffentlichen  	his taxes → seiner Steuern → seine Steuererklärung  		**Explanation:**  	The mistranslations that significantly alter the meaning are:	- "pounced" (gestürzt) is incorrectly translated as "hingewiesen" (pointed out).	- "Trump" is incorrectly translated as "Trumpf," which is not the correct reference to Donald Trump's name.	- "urging" is mistranslated as "nahe gelegt wird," changing the direct nature of the exhortation in the original context.	- "release" is incorrectly translated to the noun "Freigabe," instead of the verb form "veröffentlichen" in the context.		These errors collectively shift the sentence away from the intended meanings present in the SRC and REF translations.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation adequately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence, fitting well with the REF translation. There are no significant single-word discrepancies between HYP and REF that alter the meaning or context.

Buffet → Buffet → Buffett  	Trumpf → Trumpf → Trump  	Angst → Angst → Angst vor  	Steuererhebungsbehörde → Steuererhebungsbehörde → Steuerbehörden  	Wähler → Wähler → Wählern  		**Explanation:**  	- "Buffet" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Buffett" from SRC/REF.  	- "Trumpf" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Trump" from SRC/REF.  	- "Angst" in HYP does not capture the phrase "Angst vor" well from the REF, changing the contextual meaning.  	- "Steuererhebungsbehörde" in HYP is a less accurate translation of "Steuerbehörden," as seen in the REF, altering the specific institution referenced.  	- "Wähler" in HYP should be in the dative case "Wählern," as it appears in REF for correct grammatical usage in context.
tax returns → Steuerrückflüsse → Steuererklärung
Chappaqua → Cappaqua → Chappaqua  	föderalen → föderalen → Bundes  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Cappaqua" is a mistranslation of "Chappaqua" in SRC and should be corrected to match REF.  	2. "Föderalen" is consistent in both HYP and REF, indicating a slight preference in terminology as "Bundes" is more contextually accurate for "federal." Nonetheless, it doesn't significantly alter meaning here, thus it is identified to showcase a subtle deviation.
Clintons' → Rückkehr → Steuererklärung
investment → Fonds → Geldanlage  	index mutual → gegenseitiger → Index  	109,000 → 10 000 → 109.000  		**Explanation:**  	- "Fonds" in HYP inaccurately captures the term "investment"/"Geldanlage" from SRC/REF, focusing more on "fund" rather than "overall investment."	- "gegenseitiger" translates to "mutual" which directly does not accurately capture "index" from SRC/REF, altering the type of fund described.	- The amount "10 000" in HYP does not match the "109,000" in SRC and REF, which is a significant numerical error.
Editing → Editing → bearbeitet  		**Explanation:** "Editing" in HYP should be translated as "bearbeitet" in the context of this sentence, as correctly indicated in the REF. The HYP left "Editing" untranslated, which is a translation error.
chilli-powder → ChilliPulver → Chilipuder  	Tanzania → Tansania → Tanzanias  		**Explanation:** "ChilliPulver" in HYP is a mistranslation of "chilli-powder"/"Chilipuder" from SRC/REF, and "Tansania" does not reflect the possession indicated in "Tanzanias" from the REF translation.
Conservationists → Konservativen → Naturschützer  	chilli → Kinder → Chilipuder
**English → German Translation Errors:**		Honeyguide → honeyleitende → Honeyguide  	hit upon → gegen → die Idee dazu hatte  	Conservancy → Naturschutzbehörde → Naturschutz  	crops → Kulturen → Ernte  		**Explanation:**  	- "honeyleitende" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Honeyguide" from SRC/REF, which is a proper noun and should not be translated literally.  	- The phrase "gegen" in HYP is incorrectly used for "hit upon," which changes the intended meaning, as the REF correctly reflects "die Idee dazu hatte."  	- "Naturschutzbehörde" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Nature Conservancy" from SRC, where REF uses "Naturschutz," aligning better with the intended meaning.  	- "Kulturen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "crops," which REF translates correctly as "Ernte."
Previously → Früher → Zuvor  	spears → eingesetzt → Speere
No translation errors detected.
attitude → Sinneswandel → Änderung ihrer Einstellung  	much → viel → viel zuversichtlicher  	harming → schädigen → schaden  		**Explanation:**  	- "Sinneswandel" in HYP is a mistranslation of "attitude change"/"Änderung ihrer Einstellung" in SRC/REF, altering the context.	- "viel mehr Vertrauen" in HYP instead of "viel zuversichtlicher" in REF changes the degree of confidence expressed.	- "schädigen" in HYP deviates from the contextually correct "schaden" in REF.
torch → Fackel → Fackel  	trespassing → Trägerlefant → Elefanten  	sounding → läuten → Blasen  		**Explanation:**		1. "Torch" is translated as "Fackel" in both HYP and REF, so no error there. However, "Trägerlefant" does not correctly represent "trespassing elephant" in the context of the sentence and is a mistranslation.		2. "Sounding" should translate to "Blasen," but it is incorrectly translated as "läuten" in HYP, altering the action described.
chilli → chillische → Chili
soil → Boden → Erde  	firecracker → Feuerwascher → Feuerwerkskörper  	fuse → ausgelaufenen Fass → Zündschnur  		**Explanation:** "Boden" in HYP is a less precise translation of "Erde", "Feuerwascher" is a mistranslation of "Feuerwerkskörper", and "ausgelaufenen Fass" is a mistranslation of "Zündschnur", each significantly changing the meaning compared to SRC/REF.
lit → sich abrechnen → angezündet  	bang → Bang → Knall  	chilli → Kinder → Chilipuder  		**Explanation:**  	- "sich abrechnen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "lit"/"angezündet", significantly changing the meaning.  	- "Bang" in HYP does not properly translate "bang"/"Knall", which affects understanding.  	- "Kinderpulver" in HYP is an incorrect translation for "chilli powder"/"Chilipuder".
One → Witz → Hauch  	whiff → Witz → Hauch  	way → schicken → verjagen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Witz" (HYP) translates to "joke," which is incorrect as it should be "Hauch" ("whiff").  	- The context of sending the elephant in a different direction is mistranslated; "schicken" (HYP) translates to "send" in the sense of dispatching, while "verjagen" (REF) means "to chase away," which is more accurate.
last → letztes → letzte  	resort → Mittel → Möglichkeit  	launcher → Trägerraket → Werfer  	roman candle → Kerzenfeuer → Goldregenfeuerwerk  	bright → gute → helle
council → Gemeinderat → Stadtrat  	kiosk → Stock → Kiosk  	(St. Goarer) bank → Rheinbank → St. Goarer Rheinufer

municipal → Gemeinde → Stadtrat  	balcony → Ballons → Rheinbalkons  		**Explanation:** "Gemeinde" in HYP is a mistranslation of "municipal"/"Stadtrat" from SRC/REF, as it refers to a wrong entity. "Ballons" in HYP is a mistranslation of "balcony"/"Rheinbalkons" from SRC/REF, which misrepresents the context and meaning.
kiosk → Ekel → Kiosk		**Explanation:** "Ekel" in HYP is a mistranslation of "kiosk"/"Kiosk" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.
filmmaker → Filmemacher-Hotel → Regisseur  	slams → [missing/incorrect translation] → zerschlägt  	removing → entfernen → entfernt  	request → Antrag → Aufforderung  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Filmemacher" in HYP is misunderstood, as the more contextually appropriate translation for "filmmaker" in this context is "Regisseur" from REF. Additionally, HYP includes "-Hotel" mistakenly.	2. "Slams" in SRC is not correctly reflected in HYP. The term is missing and is essential to convey the meaning, which is correctly captured as "zerschlägt" in REF.	3. "Removing" from SRC is incorrectly translated as "entfernen" in HYP, where "entfernt" is the correct translation in the provided context.	4. "Request" in SRC is mistranslated as "Antrag" in HYP, where "Aufforderung" in the REF is a more accurate translation in context.

1. Frustration → Frustration → Ärger  	2. heraufbeschworen → heraufbeschworen → aus  	3. AZ → AZ → FAZ  		**Explanation:**  	- "Frustration" in HYP is a direct translation but "Ärger" in REF is more contextually appropriate, indicating a difference in emotional strength.	- "heraufbeschworen" in HYP indicates a different verb choice than "aus" in REF, which means "vented," fitting the context better.	- "AZ" in HYP refers to an incorrect outlet compared to "FAZ" in REF, which is the correct reference.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence when compared to the REF translation, with no significant single-word mistranslations affecting meaning.
mention → erwähnt → aufgelistet  	room → Raum → Hotelzimmer  		**Explanation:**  	1. The word "mentioned" is translated as "erwähnt" in HYP, but the REF uses "aufgelistet," which better captures the context of a list.  	2. "Room" is translated as "Raum" in HYP, but "Hotelzimmer" in REF specifies the context of the room type more accurately.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence captures the meaning of the SRC sentence accurately with no significant single-word mistranslations, even though there are stylistic and structural differences from the REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "hat geschrieben" in HYP and "schrieb" in REF translate the English "wrote," though the tense forms differ slightly, they both capture the past action correctly.

call center → Callcenter → Call Center  	dial → dialektieren → anzuwählen
Erklärung → Erklärungen → Erklärung  	Frage → Frage → Thema  	Filmemacher → Filmemacher → Regisseur  
Lanzmann → ihn → ihn  		**Explanation:** "Lanzmann" and "ihn" have been mistranslated in their position in the sentence. The translation should convey in proper order that "the answer shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote, instead of implying Lanzmann was shocked.
clerk → Clerk → Hotelangestellte  	Kempins-Hotels → Kempins-Hotels → Kempinski Hotels  		**Explanation:** The word "Clerk" in HYP is a direct borrowing from English and should be translated to "Hotelangestellte" as in REF.

move → Schritt → dahinter stand  	filmmaker → Filmemacher → Regisseur  	outrage → Empörung → Wut  
code → Kodex → Vorwahl  		**Explanation:** "Kodex" in HYP is a mistranslation of "code"/"Vorwahl" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the context as "Vorwahl" specifically refers to a dialing or area code in the context of countries like Israel.

 alleged → behaupteten → unterstellten  	demands → Forderungen → Aufforderungen
stated → sagte → hieß  	post → Posten → Beitrag  		**Explanation:** In the HYP, "sagte" and "Posten" are mistranslations of "stated" and "post" from SRC and REF, respectively, and they change the meaning in this context.
quick → schnell abgerissen → wies schnell von sich  	reports → dem Bericht des Spiegel → berichtet Der Spiegel  		**Explanation:**  	1. "schnell abgerissen" in HYP is a mistranslation for "quick to brush off" from SRC and should be "wies schnell von sich" as in the REF.  	2. "dem Bericht des Spiegel" in HYP is a mistranslation for "reports" from SRC and should be "berichtet Der Spiegel" as in the REF.

taking part → feststellen → Teilnehmer  	writing → feststellen → sprühen

Iran → der Iran → Iran  	number → eine Anzahl → die Touristenanzahl  		**Explanation:**  	- "Der Iran" in HYP does not align with how "Iran" is used in both SRC and REF. While "der Iran" can be linguistically defensible (as German often uses definite articles with country names), it introduces unnecessary translation noise when comparing with "Iran" in SRC and REF.	- "Eine Anzahl" in HYP is a less accurate translation of "number" compared to "die Touristenanzahl" in REF, though the difference is subtle and context-specific.		Note: While both identified translations in HYP could be technically defensible in German given certain contexts, they still offer room for improvement in alignment with the meanings most directly found in SRC and REF.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence is a grammatically equivalent and contextually appropriate translation of the SRC sentence compared to the REF sentence. There are no single-word changes that alter the meaning or context significantly.

lively → lebensfreudige → lebendige  	camp → Ferienlager → Freizeitheim  		**Explanation:**  	- "lebendige" is a less accurate contextual translation of "lively" compared to "lebensfreudige."	- "Urlaubslager" is a mistranslation of "camp" compared to "Freizeitheim" (referred to as "holiday camp" in the SRC).
day trips → Tagesreisen → Ganztagesausflüge  	agenda → [not translated] → Programm  		**Explanation:**  	- "Tagesreisen" in HYP does not capture the full meaning of "day trips" as presented in REF; "Ganztagesausflüge" is more precise.  	- The term "agenda" from SRC was not adequately represented in HYP, creating a context mismatch with REF's translation "Programm".
trip → Reise → ging  	petting → Pflanzen → Streichel  		**Explanation:**  	"Reise" in HYP is a mistranslation of "trip"/"ging" from SRC/REF, as it implies the act of traveling, not the specific event or occurrence.  	"Pflanzen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "petting"/"Streichel" from SRC/REF, which changes the meaning entirely (from a petting zoo to a plant zoo).
them → sie → (no direct translation, contextual difference)  	cloisters → Clister → Kloster  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Clister" in HYP is a clear mistranslation of "cloisters"/"Kloster", significantly changing the meaning.  	2. While "sie" and "them" have a direct correspondence, the context given by the source and reference highlights that "sie" does not adequately translate the intended meaning.
trip → Reise → Ausflug
Keltischen → Keltenmuseum → Keltenmuseum  	essen → Nahrung → Nahrung  		**Explanation:** "Keltischen" in HYP incorrectly mistranslates the place "Celtic Museum" (Keltenmuseum) and "essen" mistranslates the concept of "what they ate" as just the verb "eat" instead of their "diet" or "Nahrung."
dates → Terminen → Tagen  	cooled off → abgerissen → vergnügte sich  	jumping → Einmarsch → Springen  	paddling → Peitsche → Planschen

ministrants → Minister → Ministranten  	chaplaincy → Kapitemie → Seelsorgeeinheit
covered → abgedeckt → bewältigt  		**Explanation:** "Abgedeckt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "covered"/"bewältigt" from SRC/REF, as it suggests a different meaning not contextually appropriate here.
committee → Ausschuss → Oberministrantenrunde  	ministrants → Ministerien → Ministranten  	ministrants → Minister → Ministranten  		**Explanation:**   	- "Ausschuss" (committee) in HYP incorrectly translates "Oberministrantenrunde" (committee of upper ministrants) from SRC/REF. The emphasis in REF is specifically on a group of 'upper ministrants'.	- "Ministerien" (ministries) in HYP is a mistranslation of "ministrants," which should accurately be "Ministranten" as in REF.	- "Minister" (minister) in HYP is again incorrectly translating "ministrants," which should be "Ministranten" in this context, as shown in REF.

Kathedrale → Münster → Münster  	Lady → Lieben Frau → Lieben Frau  	Pilger → Pilgerweg → Pilgerweg  		**Explanation:** "Kathedrale" and "Lady" in HYP are mistranslations of "Münster" and "Lieben Frau" in REF, which are more contextually appropriate. Additionally, "Pilger" in HYP does not fit the context as it should be part of the compound "Pilgerweg" which matches the concept from REF.
day → Tagesreisen → Tagestouren  	prayers → Gebetern → Gebeten  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Tagesreisen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "day trips"/"Tagestouren" from SRC/REF. 	2. "Gebetern" in HYP should be "Gebeten," aligning with "prayers" from SRC and REF.
took → genommen → machten  	sing → zum Lied → um zu singen  		**Explanation:** "genommen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "took"/"machten" from SRC/REF, and "zum Lied" in HYP is a mistranslation of "sing"/"um zu singen" from SRC/REF, affecting the intended meaning of taking a break to sing a song.

Stage → Phase → Etappenzielen  	Dinner → Essen → Abendessen  		**Explanation:** "Phase" in HYP is a mistranslation of "stage"/"Etappenzielen" from SRC/REF, changing the context. "Essen" in HYP is a less specific translation than the intended "Abendessen" from REF, altering the meal description.
Furtwangen → Weitwangen → Furtwangen
1. set off → starteten → trat		**Explanation:** "starteten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "set off"/"trat" from SRC/REF. The REF suggests more accurately initiating an action or journey, which is contextually more appropriate. 		2. descend → abgleiten → erklommen		**Explanation:** "abgleiten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "descend"/"erklommen" from SRC/REF. The intended meaning was to descend in the context of climbing, whereas "abgleiten" suggests "sliding" or "gliding," which does not fit the context.
earned → haben → verdiente  	reward → Belohnung → Belohnung  	barbecueing → kreuzen → Grillen  	swimming → Schwimmbecken → Badweiher  		**Explanation:**  	1. "haben" in HYP doesn't match "earned" from SRC. "verdiente" in REF for "earned" is more accurate.	2. "Belohnung" is correctly translated in both HYP and REF.	3. "kreuzen" in HYP is incorrect for "barbecueing". The REF correctly uses "Grillen".	4. "Schwimmbecken" in HYP doesn't match "swimming pond" from SRC. REF's "Badweiher" is an appropriate translation for "swimming pond".
morning → Vormittagssitzung → Morgenimpuls  	cloisters → Schwestern → Klosterkirche  		**Explanation:** "Vormittagssitzung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "morning"/"Morgenimpuls" from SRC/REF, and "Schwestern" is a mistranslation of "cloisters"/"Klosterkirche" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the original meanings.
1. children → Kinder → Minis  	2. Freiburger Cathedral → Kathedrale von Freiburg → Freiburger Münster  	3. gates → Tore → Pforte  	4. mercy → Gnade → Barmherzigkeit  
moment → Augenblick → Impuls

service → Dienst → Gottesdienst  	sacristry → Heiligkeit → Sakristei  		**Explanation:** "Dienst" is a mistranslation of "service"/"Gottesdienst", and "Heiligkeit" is a mistranslation of "sacristry"/"Sakristei", both significantly altering the context.
there was → gab es → war noch  	to look around → zu schauen → für  		**Explanation:**  	1. "there was" in the SRC is translated as "gab es" in the HYP, but the REF translation uses "war noch", which fits the context more appropriately.	2. "to look around" in the SRC translates to "zu schauen" in the HYP, whereas the REF uses "für", indicating that "to look around" was not correctly translated, affecting context.
took → brachten → ging
Teilnehmer → Kameradie → Gemeinschaftserlebnis
Callum → Callum Skinner → Callum Skinner  	storms → Stürme → stürmt  	home → (missing) → nach Hause  	Brits → Grabstoffkreislauf → Brite  	cycling → (missing) → Radsport  	gold → (missing) → Gold  		**Explanation:** "Stürme" is an incorrect form in HYP for "storms"/"stürmt". "Grabstoffkreislauf" does not make sense in context and is a mistranslation of "Brits"/"Brite". Additionally, key components from the source sentence like "home", "cycling", and "gold" are not properly translated in HYP, leading to a loss of meaning compared to REF.
Callum Skinner raced → Callum Skinner geschlagen → Callum Skinner raste  	trio → der Team → das britische Team  		**Explanation:** "geschlagen" is a mistranslation for "raced" as it means "struck" or "defeated" rather than "raced". "der Team" should be translated as "das britische Team" in the given context of team names.
23-Jährige → 23-Jähriger → 23-Jährige  	befanden → befand → nahm  	Glaswegiens → aus Glasgow → aus Glasgow  	wurde → stürmte → stürmte  	Nadelsieg → Sieg → Sieg  	Aufwands → Favoriten → Favoriten  		**Explanation:**  	- "23-Jährige" in HYP should be "23-Jähriger" to refer to a male subject, as the SRC indicates, matched by the REF.	- "befanden" in HYP should be "nahm" as in REF to correctly translate the SRC meaning.	- "Glaswegiens" in HYP is inaccurately translating the SRC/REF phrase "from Glasgow."	- "wurde" in HYP should be "stürmte" as in REF to align with the SRC action.	- "Nadelsieg" in HYP is a mistranslation of "victory" in SRC, correctly translated as "Sieg" in REF.	- "Aufwands" in HYP is a mistranslation of "outfit" in SRC, correctly translated as "Favoriten" in REF.
claimed → gefordert → beanspruchte  	fifth → Fünftel → fünfte  	gold → Golde → Olympiagoldmedaillen

"Abschluss" in HYP is a mistranslation of "finishing" related to achieving a position. The REF's "sie holten" more accurately captures this meaning.	2. "kleinen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "lowly," which is better represented by "bescheidenen" in REF.	3. "Weltmeisterschaft" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Track World Championships." The specific term "Bahn" accurately reflects the type of championship, which is about track cycling.		**Summary of Errors:**  	Abschluss → sie holten   	kleinen → bescheidenen  	Weltmeisterschaft → Bahn  
issue → Frage → Problem  	specialist starter → Fachpersonal → Anfahrers  	Jamie Staff → Jamie → Jamie Staff  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Frage" in HYP is a mistranslation of "issue"/"Problem" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning.	2. "Fachpersonal" in HYP does not accurately translate the role of "specialist starter"/"Anfahrers" from SRC/REF.	3. "Jamie Staff" was not fully translated in HYP, missing the context necessary for "Specialist starter Jamie Staff".
emerged → auftraten → auftauchte
retirement → Ruhestand → Ruhestand  	void → Vakuum → Lücke  		**Explanation:** "Vakuum" in HYP is a mistranslation of "void"/"Lücke" from SRC/REF, as it changes the meaning from a metaphorical gap or absence to a literal vacuum. There are no other significant single-word translation errors.
Skinner → Busse → Mann
Hoy → Hy → Hoy
der → das → das  	für → mit → mit  
Hindes → Hinde → Hindes  	hineinmarsch → Runde → Runde  	vor Gericht → vorne → vorne
Hindes → Hinden → Hindes  	Ge[ar] → Tempo → Gang  		**Explanation:** "Hinden" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Hindes" from SRC/REF, and "Tempo" in HYP mistranslates "gear" which should align with "Gang" from REF, altering the intended context of the sentence.
Hoy → Hoch → Hoy  	pundit → Pritit → Experte  		**Explanation:**  	- "Hoy" is mistranslated as "Hoch" in the HYP. "Hoy" is a proper noun and should not be translated to "Hoch."	- "Pritit" is a mistranslation of "pundit"/"Experte." It is incorrect and not a German word that fits the context.
No translation errors detected.
myself → mich persönlich → mir einen Namen
final → Endeffekt → Endrunde  	Olympic → olympischen → Olympia  		**Explanation:** "Endeffekt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "final"/"Endrunde" from SRC/REF, and "olympischen" in HYP doesn't match the context of "Olympic record"/"Olympiarekord" from SRC/REF. Both errors significantly impact the meaning in context.

No translation errors detected.
triumphing → triumphiert → Triumph  	track → Weg → Bahn  		**Explanation:**  	- "Triumphiert" is used instead of "Triumph" for the nominal phrase, which slightly alters the grammatical structure but retains overall meaning. However, it is noted as a noun in the source ("triumphing") and reference ("Triumph").	- "Weg" is incorrectly used instead of "Bahn," which significantly alters the intended motion or end location, as "track" implies a specific sports track rather than a generic "way" or "path."
Britain's → britischen → Englands  	appeal → Berufungsmethode → Einspruch  
issue → Thema → Problem  	supreme → Obersieg → überragendem Sieg  		**Explanation:**  	- "Thema" in HYP is a mistranslation of "issue"/"Problem" from SRC/REF, altering the intended meaning.  	- "Obersieg" in HYP is a mistranslation of "supreme victory"/"überragendem Sieg" from SRC/REF, affecting the context and correctness of the translation.
sagten → sagten → sagte  	Position → Position → Tribüne  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both the HYP and REF adequately capture the meaning of the source sentence with only minor structural differences, which do not constitute translation errors.
losing → verloren → weggekommen  	amazing → erstaunlich → unglaublich  		**Explanation:** "Verloren" in HYP doesn't accurately capture the meaning of "losing out on" as "weggekommen" in the context of competition or achievements. "Erstaunlich" is also a less accurate translation of "amazing" in this context than "unglaublich," which conveys a stronger sense of amazement.
track → Trassen → Titeln  		**Explanation:** "Trassen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "track"/"Titeln" from SRC/REF. The term "Trassen" implies routes or lines, which is contextually incorrect here as it should refer to "titles" or "championships," altering the intended meaning.
barometer → Barometer → Fortschritts  	Venodrom → Venodrom → Velodrom
Kenny → der Kenny → Kennys  	realms → nicht unmöglich → Bereich  	feat → Leistung → Sieg  	Games → Spiel → Wettbewerb
Redgrave → Redgrad → Redgrave  		tally → Distanz → Ausbeute
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Despite structural differences, each word in HYP can be aligned with SRC or REF without introducing a significant mistranslation. "Das Gleiche" in HYP and the structure in REF are both acceptable translations of "the same," fitting the context.
Kenny → Bekannte → Kenny  	competes → Wettkämpfe → teilnimmt  	sprint → Spurt → Sprint  
I'm just → Ich freue mich → Ich genieße  	one → diese → dies  	for now → zunächst einmal → für den Moment
team event → Team → Team-Ereignis
get → gewinnen → kann  	mates → Kampfen → Kollegen  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although the structure differs, both HYP and REF convey the essence of loneliness and honesty related to winning alone as expressed in the SRC. There are no significant single-word mistranslations that alter the intended meaning.
Hindes → Hinde → Hindes  	sagten → sagte → sagte  	Kahlschlag → Kahlschlag → Ritter geschlagen  
day's → des Tages → des Tages  	medal → medaille → Medaillenwettbewerb
qualified → qualifiziert → qualifizierten  	pursuit → Mannschafts-Mannschaft → Rennen  		**Explanation:**  	- "qualifiziert" in HYP is a mistranslation of "qualified" ("qualifizierten" in REF), which does not fit the context of past tense in the sentence.	- "Mannschafts-Mannschaft" in HYP is a mistranslation of "pursuit" ("Rennen" in REF), significantly changing the meaning and context.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
round → Runde → Runde (No error)  	final → letzte → finale  	action → Aktionstag → Wettbewers  		**Explanation:**  	- "Runde" and "Runde" are consistent for "round" with no error.	- "letzte" translates to "last" or "previous" instead of "final," which changes the nuance slightly.	- "Aktionstag" translates to "day of action" rather than "Wettbewers," which is "competition," indicating a difference in context.
dispute → Streit → gestritten  	commissaires → Kommissaren → Beauftragten  	summoned → geladen → riefen  	height → Höhe → Körpergröße  
Rowsel → Rowsell → Rowsell  	Klatte → Kally → Katie  	Archibalt → Archibald → Archibald  	Milngave → Milngavie → Milngavie  	Weltmarktrekordzeit → unverständlich → Weltrekordszeit  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Rowsel" in HYP is a misspelling of "Rowsell" from SRC/REF.  	2. "Klatte" in HYP is an incorrect translation of "Katie" from SRC/REF.  	3. "Archibalt" in HYP is a misspelling of "Archibald" from SRC/REF.  	4. "Milngave" in HYP is a misspelling of "Milngavie" from SRC/REF.  	5. "Weltmarktrekordzeit" in HYP does not convey "Weltrekordszeit" from REF, changing its meaning to something non-existent.
mighty → mächtige → starkes  	track cycling squad → Fahrradfahrt → Bahnradteam  	take ownership → Verantwortung übernehmen → dominieren  	middle period → Mitte → mittlere Periode  	deliver → liefern → holen  	host → Vielzahl → Schar  
exceptional → außergewöhnlichen → außergewöhnlichen  	dominance → Vormachtstellungen → Dominanz  		**Explanation:**  	1. The word "dominance" in the SRC is translated to "Vormachtstellungen" in HYP, which means "preeminence" or "supremacy" instead of the more precise "Dominanz" used in the REF.  	2. Although "exceptional" in SRC translates to "außergewöhnlichen" in both HYP and REF, there is no translation error for the word "exceptional" itself. It matches adequately in both translations.  	3. The phrase "down in the lead-up to" is better translated as "heruntergefahren" in REF than "heruntergespielt" in HYP for context-specific accuracy. However, considering the single-word focus, dominance is the critical mistranslation here.
Sutton → Direktorin → Leiter  	persönlichkeiten → Persönlichkeiten → Größen  		**Explanation:**		1. "Direktorin" in HYP is a mistranslation of "director" from SRC and "Leiter" from REF, as "director" is masculine and should be "Direktor" or "Leiter", not "Direktorin".	2. "Persönlichkeiten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "figures" from SRC and "Größen" from REF. While "Persönlichkeiten" translates to "personalities," "Größen" more directly reflects "giant figures" in this context.
evidence → Anhaltspunkten → Beweise  	racing → Abendwechsels → Wettbewerbs  	velodrome → n/a → Velodrom  		**Explanation:**  	- "Anhaltspunkten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "evidence" from SRC, whereas REF uses "Beweise," maintaining the context better.	- "Abendwechsels" in HYP mistranslates "racing" when compared to REF's "Wettbewerbs," which aligns more closely with the context.	- "Velodrome" is omitted entirely in HYP, while REF includes "Velodrom," directly aligned with the SRC.
smelter → Schmelzer → Schmelzerei  	axing → Lockerung → Aufhebung
1. power → Machtunternehmen → Energie  	2. plant → Werk → Anlage  	3. disclose → Offenlegung → mitteilen  	4. terminate → kündigen → kündigen (no change, but relevant to understand context)  	5. supply → Liefervertrag → Energieliefervertrag  		**Explanation:**  	- "Machtunternehmen" is a mistranslation of "power company"/"Energieunternehmen", where "Energie" is more appropriate.  	- "Werk" translates to "plant" but in this context "Anlage" (part of "Anlagenbetreiber") as in "smelter" fits better.	- "Offenlegung" suggests disclosure in the sense of making something public, whereas "mitteilen" is correct as it means to announce or inform.	- "Liefervertrag" means "supply contract," but the reference specifically connects "Energieliefervertrag" to the power context.		Even though "kündigen" is correctly used for "terminate," its broader context is retained to understand related errors.
move → Entscheidung → Schritt  		**Explanation:** "Entscheidung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "move"/"Schritt" from SRC/REF, which significantly alters the meaning.
No translation errors detected.
**(can → können → zu)**  		**Explanation:** "können" in HYP is a mistranslation of "up to"/"zu" from the SRC/REF, changing the numerical estimation aspect of the sentence.
2000 → [No translation] → 2000  	bei einer Schließung → durch die Schließung → bei einer Schließung  		**Explanation:**  	- "2000" is missing in the HYP translation, which is an important numeral that conveys the quantity of jobs mentioned in SRC and is correctly translated in REF.  	- "durch die Schließung" as translated in HYP differs from the contextual translation in REF and SRC, where "bei einer Schließung" is more fitting.
smelter → Slumerverbrauch → Schmelzerei  	knock-on effects → Nebenwirkungen → Dominoeffekten
Point Henry → Point Henry → Point Henry Schmelzerei
Alcoa's → Alkoas → Alcoa  	smelter → Schmelzer → Schmelzerei
moves → Bewegungen → Schritt  	output → Produktion → Strompreis
1. smelter → Aluminiumschmelzen → Aluminiumschmelzerei  	2. electricity → - → Strom  	3. the big → den großen → die große  	4. power plant → - → Kraftwerk  	5. Latrobe Valley → Latrober-Tal → Latrobe Valley  	6. expects → erwartet → teilte mit, dass es davon ausgeht  	7. the other three owners → die anderen drei Eigentümer → drei weitere Besitzer  	8. will also move to terminate → auch ihre Vereinbarungen kündigen → ihre Verträge kündigen werden  		**Explanation:** Several mistranslations in the HYP significantly deviate from the REF, particularly altering the meaning.
plant → Werk → Anlage  	owned → besitzt → Besitz  	holding → besitzt → halten  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Werk" in HYP is a mistranslation of "plant"/"Anlage" from SRC/REF, as "Anlage" is more contextually appropriate when referring to a facility or plant.	2. "Besitzt" and "besitzt" in HYP for "owned" and "holding," respectively, are mistranslations. "Besitz" and "halten" would be more accurate according to the REF.
expects → erwartet → geht davon aus  	facility → Fazilität → Anlage  	smelter → Slumer → Schmelzerei
contracts → Verträge → Geschäfte  	hedging → Hedge → Sicherung  	sagte → sagte → sagte weiterhin aus  		**Explanation:**  	- "Verträge" in HYP is a mistranslation of "contracts"/"Geschäfte" from SRC/REF, which alters the nuance related to financial terms.  	- "Hedge" in HYP should be "Sicherung" to reflect the correct financial terminology for "hedging" in REF.  	- "sagte" in HYP lacks the added nuance conveyed by "sagte weiterhin aus" in REF, which involves continuous action.
Kündigungsfrist → Frist → Kündigungsfrist  	enden → abgeschlossen → enden  		**Explanation:** "Frist" in HYP does not specify "Kündigungsfrist" which is clearly stated in both SRC and REF. "Abgeschlossen" is a mistranslation of the intended meaning "enden" as per SRC and REF.
AGL → die AGL → AGL  	power company → Kraftwerk → Stromlieferant
Any → Alle → Sämtliche  	earnings → Einnahme → Einnahmen  	futures → Zukunftsaussichten → Terminmärkte  
1. contracts → Konto → Verträge	2. accounts → Konto → Jahresabschlus	3. anticipation → Vorgriff → Erwartung	4. termination → Endtermin → Kündigung
contracts → Verträge → Verträge  	smelter → Unterschlupf → Schmelzerei  	supply → betreiben → gewährleisten  		**Explanation:** The key mistranslation error lies in translating "smelter" as "Unterschlupf" in HYP, which significantly alters the meaning, as "Unterschlupf" means "shelter" in German. The correct translation, "Schmelzerei," from the REF corresponds correctly to "smelter." Similarly, while "Rüsseln" is a minor word choice issue for "contracts," both HYP and REF convey the intended meaning adequately, so the Source and Reference words are the same, showing no actual mistranslation happened in terms of "contracts." However, the HYP's use of "betreiben" (to operate) for "supply" creates a contextually significant error; the correct "gewährleisten" from REF is more accurate to denote "ensure" or "provide."
Loy Yang → Loy Jang → Loy Yang  		**Explanation:** "Jang" in HYP is a mistranslation or typo of "Yang" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the name and potentially the context.
possible → möglichen → möglichen  	both → sowohl → vor  		**Explanation:**  	1. "possible" is correctly translated as "möglichen" in both HYP and REF.	2. The word "both" which denotes a dual closure in the SRC is correctly expressed through "sowohl" in the context of HYP, corresponding with "und" later in the sentence reflecting the duality.  	   	The error analysis shows that the translations essentially maintain the intended meaning without impactful mistranslations or misrepresentations of the original content.  	   	Thus, single-word errors don't significantly change the original sentence's meaning in the translation.
Macht → Strom → Strom  		**Explanation:** "Macht" in HYP is a mistranslation of "power"/"Strom" from SRC/REF, affecting the meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both HYP and REF translations accurately convey the meaning of the source sentence. The variations in wording are minor and synonymous, fitting the context appropriately.
Generator → Stromerzeuger → Stromerzeuger
Kardashianer → Kardashian → Kardashian  	Realitätsstar TV → Reality-TV-Star → Reality-TV-Star  	im → auf dem Cover der → auf dem Cover der  	September → September → Septemberausgabe  		**Explanation:**  	- "Kardashianer" in HYP is an incorrect transliteration of "Kardashian", while REF maintains the original proper noun.	- "Realitätsstar TV" in HYP is mistranslated for "Reality-TV-Star" as in REF.	- "im" in HYP mistranslates "on the cover of" from SRC, which is correctly translated as "auf dem Cover der" in REF.  	- "September" in HYP fails to specify "Septemberausgabe" (September issue), altering the sentence's meaning by missing contextual elements.
Kardaschan → Kardaschan-Jenner → Kardashian-Jenner  	Modelle → Modelle → Model  	versteckt → versteckt → auf dem Cover  	Frage → Frage → Ausgabe  	gehaltenen → gehaltenen → begehrten  		**Explanation:**	- "Kardaschan-Jenner" in HYP is a misspelling of "Kardashian-Jenner" in REF, altering the proper name.	- "Modelle" in HYP wrongly uses the plural form for "Model" which should be singular in this context.	- "versteckt" in HYP is a mistranslation, changing the meaning to "hidden" instead of being on the "cover".	- "Frage" in HYP mistakenly translates to "issue" instead of "Ausgabe".	- "gehaltenen" in HYP mistakenly translates to "held" instead of "coveted", leading to a loss of the intended meaning.

The HYP word "Sumpf" is a mistranslation of "cover", which is correctly translated as "Cover" in the REF.	2. "Kane" in HYP is a misspelling of "Kanye" from SRC/REF.	3. "Abdeckung" in HYP is incorrectly translated, as it should be "Cover" as per REF.
September Issue → September-Affäre → Septemberausgabe
thickness → Dicke → Umfang  	issue → Thema → Ausgabe  	advertisers → Werbung → Werbetreibenden  		**Explanation:**  	- "Dicke" in HYP is a mistranslation of "thickness"/"Umfang" from SRC/REF. "Umfang" more accurately refers to the overall size or volume rather than just thickness.  	- "Thema" in HYP is a mistranslation of "issue"/"Ausgabe" from SRC/REF. "Ausgabe" specifically refers to an edition or issue of a publication.  	- "Werbung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "advertisers"/"Werbetreibenden" from SRC/REF. "Werbung" refers to advertisements, while "Werbetreibenden" refers to the advertisers.
revelation → Enthüllung → Enthüllung  	cover star → Deckstars → Coverstars  	hotly → heiß → sehnsüchtig  		**Explanation:**  	- "Enthüllung" accurately translates "revelation" in both HYP and REF, so no error there.	- "Deckstars" in HYP is a mistranslation of "cover star"/"Coverstars" from SRC/REF.	- "heißen" in HYP is a mistranslation for "hotly"/"sehnsüchtig," which contextually fits better as "sehnsüchtig."
Previous → Frühere → bereits  	cover → Schutz → Cover  	feature → eintrafen → waren  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Previous" (SRC) is mistranslated as "Frühere" (HYP) when it should be understood as "bereits" (REF) in the given context.	2. "Cover" (SRC) is mistranslated as "Schutz" (HYP), which means "protection," while it should have been translated to "Cover" (REF) in this context, referring to a magazine cover.	3. "Feature" (SRC) is mistranslated as "eintrafen" (HYP), which is incorrect in this context, while "waren" (REF) meaning "were" fits the intended meaning in the phrase.
cover → Deckmantel → Cover  	celebrities → Jubeln → Berühmtheiten  	celebrities → Feier → Berühmtheiten
Gewinner → Botschafter → Preisträgerin  	Botschafter → (not present) → Markenbotschafterin  	waren → zu nennen → war  		**Explanation:**  	- "Gewinner" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Preisträgerin" in REF, which properly translates "winner" in a gender-appropriate way given the context of a female Oscar winner.  	- The term "Botschafter" in HYP does not capture the complete term "Markenbotschafterin" in REF, which refers to an ambassador for Dior, missing the "brand" context.	- "waren zu nennen" in HYP incorrectly conveys the tense and aspect when compared to "war" in REF, which matches the structure of the SRC.
magazine → Zeitschrift → Zeitschrift  	breakout → Ausbruchmodell → Durchbruchmodel  		**Explanation:** 	- "Ausbruchmodell" is a mistranslation of "breakout model" from SRC to REF. The correct translation should be "Durchbruchmodel," which carries the intended meaning related to achievement or rising prominence.
These → Diese Feierlichkeiten → Diese Berühmtheiten  		relatives → Verwandten → verwandt  		celebrities → Feierlichkeiten → Berühmtheiten  		reality stars → Realitätsstars → Reality Stars  		kids → Kinder → Jugendliche  		make → machen → dreht
legitimately → rechtmäßig → wirklich
Beyonce → die → Beyonce  	appeared → stand → erschien  	release → Freilassung → Veröffentlichung  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Beyonce" is completely omitted in the HYP sentence as it is replaced with "die," which does not translate or refer to "Beyonce."	2. "appeared" is mistranslated as "stand" in the HYP, whereas the correct translation is "erschien."	3. "release" is mistranslated as "Freilassung" in HYP, which commonly refers to "release" in the sense of freeing someone, rather than "Veröffentlichung," which is the correct term for releasing a product, such as an album.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "freut sich nicht jeder über" in HYP and "gefällt nicht jedem" in REF adequately convey the meaning of "not everyone is pleased about" from SRC. The difference in phrasing does not alter the core meaning or context.
reality → Realität → Reality-TV  	fashion → modernen → Mode
Seymour → Seymour → Seymour (HYP and REF both have the correct name, no error here.)		Geheimmodell → Geheimmodell → Victoria's Secret-Modell  	Kollegen → Kollegen → Kollegin  	Hado → Hado → Hadid  	Bitten → Bitten → Miststücke		**Explanation:**  	- "Geheimmodell" is a mistranslation of "Victoria's Secret-Modell." It is important because the brand's specific name is essential for understanding.	- "Kollegen" is plural and masculine, which might not fit since REF uses "Kollegin" (singular feminine) to match "Gigi Hadid," who is a female and a single individual. 	- "Hado" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Hadid," which is a critical name error.	- "Bitten" is a mistranslation of "Miststücke" and changes the offensive nature of the intended phrase.
**(SRC word → HYP word → Correct REF word)**		sentiment → Gefühl → Gefühle  	boiled up → verstärkt → kochten hoch
Unzufriedenheit → Missmut → discontent  	Punkt → Punkt → point  		**Explanation:** "Unzufriedenheit" in HYP translates to "Missmut" in REF, both referring to "discontent" from SRC. "Punkt" matches in both HYP and REF translations, adequately conveying "point" from SRC. "Einzugehen" in HYP might miss the connotation of "dwelling" compared to "herumzureiten" in REF, but since the task focuses on single-word errors primarily impacting meaning, "einzugehen" will not be listed as a significant error here.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Issue of Vogue.  	HYP: Kendall Jenner ist im Zusammenhang mit der September-Affäre Vogue.  	REF: Kendall Jenner ist auf dem Cover der Septemberausgabe der Vogue.  		**Errors Identified:**		- cover → Zusammenhang → Cover	- Issue → Affäre → Ausgabe		**Output:**		cover → Zusammenhang → Cover  	Issue → Affäre → Ausgabe  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately translates the SRC sentence into German, with synonym handling and word order adjustments that do not fundamentally alter the meaning compared to the REF sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "geht" in HYP and "läuft" in REF are acceptable translations of "walking" from the SRC, and there is no significant change in meaning or context.
Estee Lauder foundation → Estee Lauder-Stiftung → Grundierung von Estee Lauder
paywalled apps → bezahlten Papieren → Paywall-Apps  		**Explanation:** "Papiere" in HYP is a mistranslation of "paywalled apps" from SRC and "Paywall-Apps" from REF, significantly altering the meaning in the context.
1. selling → Verkaufsbilder → verkauft	2. magazine → LOVE → die Zeitschrift LOVE
downtime → Uhrzeit → Freizeit  	reality television → Realitätsfernsehen → Reality TV  
Community → Gemeinschaft → Gemeinde  	legal → [missing in HYP] → Rechtszentren  	turn away → machen weg → weisen ab  	people → Menschen → Leute  		**Explanation:**  	- "Gemeinschaft" in HYP is a mistranslation of "community"/"Gemeinde" from SRC/REF. 	- HYP omits to clearly include "legal" as seen in SRC and REF, expressed through "Rechtszentren" in REF.	- "machen weg" in HYP is a mistranslation of "turn away"/"weisen ab" in SRC/REF.	- While "Menschen" and "Leute" can be synonyms, "Leute" in REF is closer to the common usage in this context.
nation → Nation → Landes  	vulnerable → Schwächsten → Hilfsbedürfigsten  	community → gemeinschaftlichen → Gemeinderechtszentren  	operations → Operationen → Transaktionen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Nation" in HYP mistranslates "nation" in SRC, where the correct contextual translation is "Landes" as in REF.  	- "Schwächsten" in HYP mistranslates "vulnerable" in SRC, where the more accurate translation is "Hilfsbedürfigsten" as in REF.  	- "gemeinschaftlichen" in HYP does not fully capture the meaning of "community legal centres" in SRC, where "Gemeinderechtszentren" is more precise, as in REF.  	- "Operationen" in HYP mistranslates "operations" from SRC, where "Transaktionen" fits better contextually, as in REF.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words used in the HYP are legitimate translations of the corresponding words in the SRC and align well with the REF. While there are some minor differences in word choice between HYP and REF, they do not significantly alter the meaning or context of the SRC sentence.
gemeinschaftlichen → Juristische → juristische  	drängen → machen sich bereit → machen sich bereit
federal → föderalen → Bundes
1. Queensland → Quenelland → Queensland  	2. Community → gemeinschaftlichen → Gemeinderechtszentren  	3. Census Report → Nationale Verband der Rechtszentren der Gemeinschaft → Erhebung der Nationalen Vereinigung von Gemeinderechtszentren
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The candidate translation (HYP) accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, and while there are some differences in phrasing compared to the reference translation (REF), they do not constitute significant single-word translation errors.
Queensland's → der Gemeinschaften → Queenslands  	vital → lebenswichtigen → wichtigen  		**Explanation:** "Queensland's" in SRC is incorrectly translated as "der Gemeinschaften" in HYP, whereas REF accurately conveys it as "Queenslands". "Vital" in SRC is translated as "lebenswichtigen" in HYP, while REF uses "wichtigen," both are correct, but considering context, vital connotes "important" in REF, creating a negligible distinction.
help → benötigte → Hilfe  		**Explanation:** "benötigte" in HYP is missing the translation of "help"/"Hilfe" present in both SRC and REF, resulting in a significant change in meaning.
vulnerable → verwundbarere → hilfsbedürftigeren  		**Explanation:** "Verwundbarere" in HYP is a mistranslation of "vulnerable"/"hilfsbedürftigeren" from SRC/REF, changing the nuance and meaning in the context of people needing assistance.
Attorney-General → Generalstaatsanwalt → Generalbundesanwalt  	immediately → unverzüglich → umgehend  	reverse → umzukehren → aufzuheben
government → Regierung → Landesregierung  	legal aid → Rechtsbeihilfen → Rechtshilfen  		**Explanation:** "Regierung" in HYP should be "Landesregierung" as in REF, which more accurately translates "state government" from SRC. "Rechtsbeihilfen" refers to "legal aid," but "Rechtshilfen" typically fits the context better in German.	
Palaszczuk → Palaszzkok → Palaszczuk  		**Explanation:** "Palaszzkok" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Palaszczuk" from both the SRC and REF sentences, as it alters the proper noun's spelling and affects context.
- staffer → gezaubert → Mitarbeiter	- pulled → gezaubert → zog	- gun → gezaubert → Waffe
Trumpf → Trump → Trumps  	angeklagt → angezogen → angeklagt  	angezogen → gerichtet → gerichtet  		**Explanation:**  	- "Trumpf" in HYP is a mistranslation/misspelling of "Trump" from both SRC and REF.	- "Angeklagt" in HYP is incorrect for the context of this part of the sentence, where "angezogen" was used; however, "angeklagt" aligns better with "gerichtet" referring to aiming a gun in the REF.	- "Angezogen" in HYP is a mistranslation, as "gerichtet" from REF and the context (pointing a gun) should be used.
Bordini → Bordi → Bordini  		**Explanation:** The name "Bordini" in the SRC and REF is incorrectly translated as "Bordi" in the HYP, which is a significant error in this context since it changes the name of a person.
Bordini → Bordii → Bordini
director → Direktor → Kampagnenleiter  	produced → herausgegeben → zog  	right → richtigen → rechten  	index finger → Index → Zeigefinger  	trigger → Auslöser → Abzug  	drove → getrieben → rammte  	barrel → Barrel → Lauf  	knee cap → Knie → Kniekehle  	Bordi → Bordi → Bordini  	complaint → Beschwerde → Anklage
Bordini → Bordi → Bordini  	Menschen → Personen → Personen  	Anmeldungen → Anklageschrift → Anklageschrift  		**Explanation:**  	- "Bordi" in HYP is a mistranslation/misspelling of "Bordini" from SRC/REF, affecting the proper noun's accuracy.	- "Menschen" in HYP translates to "people," while "Personen" would more accurately match "people" in REF.	- "Anmeldungen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Anklageschrift" (filing) in REF, changing the context and meaning.
Bordini → Bordi → Bordini
Anzug → Anklage → Anklage  	Ärger → Aufruhr → Aufruhr  	Kandidat → Präsidentschaftskandidat → Präsidentschaftskandidat  	Menge → Menschenmenge → Menschenmenge  	Änderungsantrag → Amendment → Amendment  	aneignen → ernennen → ernennen
media → Medien → Medien  	his → ihre → seine  		**Explanation:**  	"Medien" is correctly translated, hence no error is needed for the first part.  	The main single-word translation error is "ihre" instead of "seine," which changes the subject's ownership to "her" instead of the intended "his."
compensation → Entschädigung → Schadensersatz  	supervision → Überwachung → Verletzung der Sorgfaltspflicht  	assault → Überfälle → Körperverletzung  	battery → Batterien → Körperverletzung  	infliction → Verzweiflung → bleibender seelischer Schäden  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Entschädigung" in HYP is a possible translation for "compensation," but "Schadensersatz" in REF fits better in this legal context.  	2. "Überwachung" can mean "supervision" in a general sense, but "Verletzung der Sorgfaltspflicht" (breach of duty of care) in REF provides a contextually appropriate translation in legal terms.  	3. "Überfälle" usually refers to "raids" or "attacks," which is a mistranslation of "assault" in this context. "Körperverletzung" is the more precise legal term for such an offense.  	4. "Batterien" is incorrect here, as it directly refers to batteries in English. The correct legal term for "battery" in this context is "Körperverletzung."  	5. "Verzweiflung" (despair) is not an appropriate translation for "infliction of emotional distress." The term "bleibender seelischer Schäden" correctly conveys the legal nuance of enduring psychological harm.
Trump → treppe → Trumps  	spokeswoman → Sprecherin → Pressesprecherin  	immediately → sofort → war nicht zu erreichen (multi-word consideration; ignoring for single-word focus)  	message → Botschaft → Stellungnahme

Trumpp → Trumpp → Trump  		**Explanation:** "Trumpp" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Trump" from both SRC and REF, indicating a typographical error in the candidate translation.
Bordini → Bordi → Bordini  	Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	Justice → Gerichtshof → Gericht  	Superior → Obersten → Oberstes  		**Explanation:**  	- "Bordi" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Bordini" from SRC/REF, showing an incorrect modification of a proper noun.  	- "Trumpf" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Trump" from SRC/REF, incorrectly altering a proper noun.  	- "Gerichtshof" in HYP does not match "Justice"/"Gericht" from SRC/REF, where "Justice" indicates the type or function of the court rather than the whole institution.   	- "Obersten" in HYP inaccurately translates "Superior"/"Oberstes" from SRC/REF, changing the grammatical form and potentially the hierarchy implied by the term.
Poll → Abstimmung → Umfrage  	lose out → [missing] → verlieren  		**Explanation:** "Abstimmung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "poll"/"Umfrage" from SRC/REF. Additionally, the concept of "losing out" is missing in HYP compared to SRC and REF, where "verlieren" is used in REF.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation adequately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence, and although there are some differences in word choice compared to the REF translation, these differences do not change the overall meaning or context. Therefore, there are no significant single-word translation errors present.
findings → Ergebnisse → ergaben  	representative poll → Volksbefragung → repräsentative Umfragen  
knapp → einfach → knapp  		**Explanation:** "Einfach" in HYP (meaning "simply" or "easily") is a mistranslation of "knapp" from the REF, which implies "barely" or "by a narrow margin," altering the meaning in context.
chances → Chancen → Chancen  		**Explanation:** Despite the different sentence structures, the translation of "chances" to "Chancen" in HYP is correct. No single-word translation error is present in terms of meaning change or contextual misfit. 		Therefore:  	**No translation errors detected.**
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While the wording and structure between HYP and REF differ, both translations convey the correct entities ("the Left" and "the AfD") and the concept of competing or contention over "third place," maintaining the original meaning from SRC.
käme → hatte → käme  	Landtag → Regionalparlament → Landtag  		**Explanation:** "hatte" in HYP mistranslates "had"/"käme" from SRC/REF, changing the intended meaning of potential or forecasted result. "Regionalparlament" in HYP is a substitution for "Landtag" from SRC/REF, indicating a different governmental body.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence. The translations for each word or phrase are contextually appropriate and similar to the REF translation. There are no single-word translation errors that change the meaning significantly.
NPD → RPD → FDP
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the content in the SRC sentence, with no significant mistranslations altering the meaning or context compared to the REF.
take → kosten → erreichte  	**Explanation:** "Kosten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "take"/"erreichte," as it implies cost rather than the intended meaning of achieving or reaching a percentage.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence is consistent with the SRC sentence and is appropriately aligned with the REF translation. Any differences are minor and do not significantly change the meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** All terms in the HYP sentence are adequately translated from the SRC sentence, matching the overall meaning provided in the REF sentence, with no significant mistranslation identified.
FPD → FPD → FDP  	auskommen → auskommen → verpassen  		**Explanation:** "FPD" in HYP is a mistranslation of "FDP" from REF/SRC, which stands for the political party in question. "Auskommen" in HYP is an incorrect translation for "miss out" in SRC and "verpassen" in REF, changing the intended outcome significantly.
Communicator → Kommunikation → Communicator  	Erstes → erste → Das erste  	Smartphones → Smartphone → Smartphone  		**Explanation:** "Kommunikation" mistranslates "Communicator", "Erstes" and "Smartphones" in HYP fail to match the REF contextually for "Das erste Smartphone".
Internet → sind → in  	slow motion → nur langsam in Bewegung gebracht → in Zeitlupe  	Kommunikation → Kommunikation → Communicator
successors → Nachfolger → Die Nachfolger  	is in the midst of → befindet sich inmitten → erlebte  	a disaster → einer Katastrophe → ein Desaster
weighed → gewogen → wog  	heavy → hoch → schwer  		**Explanation:** "Gewogen" and "wog" both adequately translate "weighed" from SRC, but in context, "wog" is the more direct translation. Additionally, "hoch" in HYP is a mistranslation of "heavy"/"schwer" from SRC/REF, changing the context significantly.
thicker → immer noch → dicker  	larger → immer → größer  	harder → schwieriger → nicht gut in der Hand  		**Explanation:** 	- "immer noch" in HYP replaces "thicker" from SRC with an inaccurate translation compared to "dicker" in REF. 	- "immer" in HYP replaces "larger" from SRC, which is incorrectly translated compared to "größer" in REF.	- "schwieriger" in HYP translates "harder" from SRC, which changes the nuance compared to "nicht gut in der Hand" in REF.
Indeed → Sie → Im Gegenteil  	bulky → schwammig → klobig  
in-built → im Bau befindliche → eingebaute  	storage → Lagerhaltung → Speicher  	megabytes → Megabyten → Megabyte  	high-resolution → Hochwasserstoffe → hoher Auflösung  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP accurately translates the SRC sentence to German. Even though the structure differs from REF, the individual words and overall meaning align correctly with SRC.
Nokia 9000 Communicator → Nokia 9000 Kommunikatorin → Nokia 9000 Communicator  	Smartphone → Smartpon → Smartphone  		**Explanation:** "Kommunikatorin" is a mistranslation of "Communicator" as it changes the meaning and is gendered inappropriately in German. "Smartpon" is a typographical error for "Smartphone," which is the correct translation.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words in the HYP sentence adequately convey the meaning and context of the SRC sentence, with no significant mistranslations when compared to both SRC and REF. The differences are more stylistic and do not change the essential meaning or context.
However → jedoch → jedoch  	Communicator → Kommunikator → Communicator  	sparked → ausgelöst → war  	a sensation → einen Senat → eine Sensation  		**Explanation:** In this case, "Kommunikator" may seem a reasonable transliteration but could carry a different connotation depending on the context of application. The key errors are "ausgelöst" instead of "war," which changes the verb and subsequently the meaning greatly, and "einen Senat," which is incorrect compared to the "a sensation" in the REF.
- billed → abgerechnet → angekündigt		**Explanation:** The word "abgerechnet" in the HYP is a mistranslation of "billed" from SRC, which in this context means "announced." The REF uses "angekündigt," fitting the context better. The error significantly alters the intended meaning.

calculator → Kalender → Taschenrechner
Antenna → Antenna → Antenne  	weiterverfolgt → weiterverfolgt → aufgeklappt  
keyboard → Leitfaden → Tastatur
price → Preis → Preis  	deutschmarks → Deutsche → D-Mark  		**Explanation:** "Preis" adequately translates "price" from SRC, showing a minor synonym variation with REF. However, "Deutsche" as HYP is a mistranslation of "deutschmarks"/"D-Mark" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning. Other differences between the sentences do not qualify as single-word translation errors or are stylistic variations without significant impact on meaning.

mass market → Massenmarkt kaputt → Durchbruch zum Massenmarkt  	iphone → iphone → iPhones  		**Explanation:** "Massenmarkt kaputt" is a mistranslation that incorrectly renders the meaning of "breaking into the mass market," whereas the REF uses "Durchbruch zum Massenmarkt". "iphone" should be capitalized as "iPhones" to match proper noun formatting in German, as shown in the REF.
No translation errors detected.
iPhone → iphone → iPhone

No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence, and the differences with REF are stylistic rather than semantic, focusing on word choices that are synonymous in the provided context.
phone → Telefone → Smartphone  		**Explanation:** "Telefone" in HYP is a plural and more generic translation for "phones", while "Smartphone" in REF provides a more specific and contextually accurate translation for the source.
contactable → Kontakt aufzunehmen → Erreichbarkeit  	become → geworden → gilt  		**Explanation:**  		1. "contactable" is mistranslated as "Kontakt aufzunehmen" (meaning "making contact") in HYP instead of the correct translation "Erreichbarkeit" (meaning "contactable" or "availability") as in the REF.	2. "become" is translated as "geworden" in HYP, which is less accurate compared to "gilt" used in the REF for "considered as" in this context.

No translation errors detected.

No translation errors detected.
unemployment → schaffen → ein Ende bereiten
Just → Genauso → So  	ahead → vor → voraus
Britain → Großbritannien → England  	embarrassed → peinlich → blamieren
Heathrow → sich → bei		**Explanation:** In the context of the sentences, the HYP word "sich" does not adequately reflect the corresponding positioning and use of "on" from the SRC sentence or "bei" from the REF sentence, which provides the correct prepositional usage.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The translation provided in HYP captures the meaning of the SRC sentence accurately and aligns well with the REF translation. Any discrepancies such as "Frage" vs. "Anfrage" are minor and do not significantly alter the meaning in this context.

Facebook → Facebook → Facebook (No error in the name)	Blockaden → Blockaden → Anzeigeblockierungen  	Blogstelle → Blogstelle → Blogpost  	Bänder → Bänder → Werbung  		**Explanation:**  	- "Blockaden" (meaning "blockades") in HYP does not align with "Anzeigeblockierungen" (meaning "ad blockers") in REF, which better represents the original intent of blocking ad blockers.	- "Blogstelle" in HYP is mistranslated, as it doesn't fit the common term "Blogpost" used to represent a blog entry.	- "Bänder" in HYP, meaning "tapes" or "bands," is a mistranslation of "Werbung" (ads/adverts) from REF and isn't contextually suitable.

1. ad blockers → Blockaden → Anzeigenblockierer  	2. effective → nicht wirksam → keine Wirkung  	3. desktop → (missing in HYP) → Desktop PCs  	4. apps → Papieren → App  		**Explanation:**  	- "Blockaden" in HYP is a mistranslation of "ad blockers" as "Anzeigenblockierer" is the correct term.  	- "nicht wirksam" is a translation issue for "effective," with "keine Wirkung" being the appropriate phrase in this context.  	- "Desktop PCs" is missing in HYP, impacting the translation of "desktop."  	- "Papieren" is a mistranslation for "apps," with "App" being the accurate word.
Desktop ads → Destop-Bads → Werbung auf Desktop PCs  	judged → hielt → erscheint  		**Explanation:**  	- "Destop-Bads" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Desktop ads" from SRC/REF.	- "Held" ("hielt") in HYP is a mistranslation of "judged" in SRC, as the REF correctly uses "erscheint" (appears) to convey the intended meaning.
Facebook → Facebook → Facebook  	Maschen → Maschen → Werbung  		Explanation:	- "Facebook" is consistent across SRC, HYP, and REF, so it is not a translation error.	- "Maschen" in the HYP is a mistranslation of "ads"/"Werbung" from the SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning to "meshes" instead of "ads."		Correctly identifying "Maschen" as a mistranslation results in the single-word error identification:		ads → Maschen → Werbung
claimed → sagte → behauptete  	site → Standort → Seite  		**Explanation:**  	1. "sagte" in HYP is a mistranslation of "claimed"/"behauptete" from SRC/REF, changing the nuance of how Facebook expressed their concern.	2. "Standort" in HYP is a mistranslation of "site"/"Seite" from SRC/REF, as "Standort" refers to a location or position rather than a website.
people → Menschen → Nutzer  	issue → Thema → Problem  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Menschen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "people"/"Nutzer" from SRC/REF, which implies a more general term than the contextually accurate "users."	2. "Thema" in HYP is a mistranslation of "issue"/"Problem" from SRC/REF, affecting the context that focuses on addressing a specific concern.
Ad → Blockiers → Anzeigenblockierer  	Instrument → Mittel → Mittel  	Instrumenten → Entwicklertools → Entwicklertools  	Menschen → leute → Leute  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Blockiers" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Ad blockers"/"Anzeigenblockierer" from SRC/REF.	2.

No translation errors detected.
an → auf → auf  	Anschlag → Donnerstag → Donnerstag  		**Explanation:**  	1. "an" in HYP translates incorrectly compared to "auf" in both the SRC ("appeal" = "auf" in context of reaching out) and REF ("ruft auf").	2. "Anschlag" in HYP is not an appropriate translation for "act of suicide" as it implies an attack, compared to "Donnerstag" in the REF, which aligns with the SRC mentioning "Thursday."
A1 → am → auf der  	near → bei → in der Nähe von  	Vaud → von Vaud → Waadt  		**Explanation:**  	- "am" in HYP is a mistranslation of "A1" which should be "auf der" as in REF.  	- "bei" in HYP mistranslates "near" which should be "in der Nähe von" as in REF.  	- "von Vaud" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Vaud" which should be "Waadt" as in REF.

criminal investigation → strafrechtliche Untersuchung → Ermittlungsverfahren  	(A criminal investigation was opened vs An investigation procedure was opened, showing a significant meaning shift)		told → sagte → teilte mit  	(The phrase structure and context indicate "teilte mit" is more accurate for a contextual rendering like "told")
drivers → Fahrer → Fahrer  	Gebühren → Gebühren → angezeigt  		**Explanation:** The word "Gebühren" (fees) in HYP is a mistranslation of "charges" ("angezeigt") from SRC/REF. The context in REF implies legal charges rather than monetary fees. This changes the meaning of the sentence.
impact → Auswirkungen → Zusammenstoß  		**Explanation:** "Auswirkungen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "impact" which is more accurately translated as "Zusammenstoß" in this context. This changes the intended meaning from a collision or impact event to more general "effects" or "consequences," which doesn't fit the context as intended in the source sentence.
Hofstetter → Hofsteter → Hofstetter  		**Explanation:** The name "Hofstetter" was mistranslated as "Hofsteter" in the HYP, which changes the spelling and potentially the pronunciation of the proper noun.

1. judged → eingeschätzt → entschieden  	2. paper → Papier → Zeitung  		**Explanation:** In the hypothesis, "eingeschätzt" is a mistranslation of "judged" which should be "entschieden", as seen in the REF.

1. acquitted → verurteilt → freigesprochen	2. police officer → Polizeibeamter → Polizistin	3. death → Tode → Tötung	4. on the A1 → in der A1 → auf der A1	5. near Paynerne → nahe Paynernennacht → in der Nähe von Payerne
drinking → getrunken → getrunken  	passed out → gegangen → bewusstlos geworden  		**Explanation:** "Getrunken" in HYP is a correct translation of "drinking"; however, "gegangen" is a mistranslation of "passed out," which should be "bewusstlos geworden" as in REF.
policewoman → Polizist → Polizistin  	responding → reagierte → geantwortet  		**Explanation:**  	"Polizist" in HYP mistranslates "policewoman"/"Polizistin" from SRC/REF, altering the gender and context.  	"Reagierte" in HYP does not fully convey "responding"/"geantwortet" in SRC/REF, as "geantwortet" suggests a response to a call, which fits the context better.
021 644 83 46 → 021 644 646 → 021 644 83 46  	021 644 44 44 → 021 644 44 → 021 644 44 44  		**Explanation:** The phone numbers in the HYP are mistranslated. The first phone number is missing the second '83' portion from the original, and the second phone number is incomplete compared to the source and reference.

No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence with all key terms correctly translated, and the contextual meaning aligns with the REF translation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation closely aligns with the REF translation, with differences in phrasing that don't significantly affect meaning or context. The mistranslations that typically warrant reporting are absent.
Venus → Venus → die Venus  	seiner → seiner → ihrer  	wasserfreien → wasserfreien → wasserlosen  	CO2-Schockatmosphäre → CO2-Schockatmosphäre → CO2-dichten Atmosphäre  	Erdbedingungen → Erdbedingungen → erdähnliche Bedingungen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Venus" in HYP lacks the article "die" as in REF, which can lead to misunderstanding in German.	- "seiner" in HYP refers incorrectly to "Venus," which is feminine, requiring "ihrer" as in REF.	- "wasserfreien" does not convey the same lack of water as "wasserlosen" in REF.	- "CO2-Schockatmosphäre" mistranslates "CO2-dichten Atmosphäre" from REF, giving a different meaning.	- "Erdbedingungen" in HYP is less precise than "erdähnliche Bedingungen" from REF, which changes the meaning.
langsame Rotationsrate → langsame Umdrehung  	seine → ihre  	dicke → dichte
spun → springen → weiterdrehte  		**Explanation:** "Springen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "spun"/"weiterdrehte" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.
beleuchtete → betrachtete → betrachtete  	Topografie → Topographie → Topographie  	No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
Early → Früh → Die frühe  	dim → dimmer → matter
Venus' → Verfall → Venus  	spins → Verfall → Umdrehung  	dayside → Sonne → Tagesseite  	scientist → Wissenschaftlerin → Wissenschaftler  	release → Mitteilung → Pressemitteilung
produces → erzeugt → produziert  	creates → hervorbringen → erschafft  	clouds → Wolkenschicht → Schicht Wolken  	acts → wirkt → wirkt  	umbrella → Schirm → Regenschirm  	shield → schützen → abschirmen  	solar heating → Sonnenenergie → Sonnenwärme
result → Ergebnis → Ergebnis  	mean → Klimatemperatur → Durchschnittstemperaturen  	cooler → külter → kühler  		**Explanation:**  	- "Klimatemperatur" does not accurately capture the meaning of "mean climate temperatures", which should refer to "Durchschnittstemperaturen". 	- "Külter" in the HYP is a typographical error for "kühler", which is correctly translated in the REF. However, both serve to convey "cooler" from SRC.
model → Modell → Modell  	planetary scientists → Weltwissenschaftlern → Planetenforschern  		**Explanation:**  	- "Modell" appears correctly translated in HYP and REF for "model."  	- "Weltwissenschaftlern" is not a correct translation of "planetary scientists." It means "world scientists" in English, whereas the REF uses "Planetenforschern," which correctly translates to "planetary scientists." The error significantly impacts the meaning.
1. Ultraviolet → Ultraviolet → ultraviolettem  	2. Licht → [missing] → Licht  		**Explanation:** In the HYP sentence, "Ultraviolet" is incorrectly translated as the English word itself, while it should be "ultraviolettem" in German. Additionally, "Licht" (light) is entirely missing in the HYP sentence but is present in both the SRC and REF.
evaporated → verflüchteten → verdunsteten  	vapor → Wasservakuum → Wasserdampf
Hydrogen → Wasserstoff → Hydrogen  	Kohlenstoffdioxid → Kohlendioxid → Kohlenstoffdioxid  	wie → den → wie  		**Explanation:**  	- "Wasserstoff" in HYP is technically viable, but "Hydrogen" is left untranslated in the REF, considering it as an explicit stylistic choice.	- "Kohlendioxid" in HYP should match the more precise "Kohlenstoffdioxid" in REF.	- "den" in HYP changes the structure and meaning compared to "wie" in REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation adequately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence and aligns well with the REF translation, considering allowable variations in the translation.
Patrick Roy → Kraftomnibusse → Trainer
coach → Bus → Trainer  	vice president → Fahrstuhlvorsitzender → Vice President  
executive → stellvertretende → Alternativ  	coach → Bus → Trainer  		**Explanation:** "Stellvertretende" in HYP is a mistranslation of "executive"/"Alternativ" from SRC/REF, and "Bus" in HYP is a mistranslation of "coach"/"Trainer" from SRC/REF. Both these errors significantly change the intended meaning.
For this input, let's identify the single-word translation errors:		1. **head coach → Chefbus → Cheftrainer**  	   "Chefbus" is incorrect as it is a mistranslation of "head coach," which should be "Cheftrainer."		2. **duties → Aufgabe → Pflichten**  	   "Aufgabe" is less accurate compared to "Pflichten" for translating "duties" in this context.		Based on the analysis, the relevant missed translations are as follows:		head coach → Chefbus → Cheftrainer  	duties → Aufgabe → Pflichten  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence accurately compared to the REF sentence. The differences such as "gründlich" vs "viel," "erforderliche" vs "mehr," and tense variations do not constitute significant mistranslations changing the overall meaning. Both translations capture the essence and purpose adequately.
coach → Kraftomnibusverkehrs → Trainers  	VP-hockey operations → VP-Hockey-Operationen → Vice President Of Hockey Operations
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "gegenwärtig" in HYP and "momentan" in REF appropriately translate "currently" from the SRC sentence, indicating a minor synonym variation without a change in meaning.
Sakic → Sakaki → Sakic  	dankte → bedankte sich → bedankte sich  	dem → das → das
Sakic → Sakak → Sakic  		**Explanation:** "Sakak" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Sakic" from SRC/REF, altering the attribution of the quote significantly.
No translation errors detected.
named → genannt → ausgezeichnet  	rookie → Spaisesaison → Debütsaison  
club → Club → Verein  	finish → Ende → Platz  	Central Division → Zentralstelle → Central Vision  	upset → gestört → geschlagen  	playoffs → Plakate → Playoffs  	missed → verließ → verpasste  		**Explanation:**  	- "Club" in HYP should be "Verein".	- "Ende" in HYP should be "Platz".	- "Zentralstelle" in HYP should be translated to "Central Vision".	- "gestört" in HYP incorrectly translates "upset"; "geschlagen" is a better match.	- "Plakate" in HYP is a mistranslation of "playoffs"; "Playoffs" is correct.	- "verließ" suggests leaving intentionally, while "verpasste" translates to "missed", which retains the intended meaning.
Avalanche → Avalanche → Avalanches  	vor → vor → hinter  	Windkartenplatz → Windkartenplatz → Wildcard Spot  
Hall of Fame Galender → Hall of Fame Torwart  	Apfel → Stücke  		**Explanation:** "Galender" in HYP is a mistranslation of "goaltender"/"Torwart" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning significantly. "Apfel" is a mistranslation of "two apiece"/"zwei Stücke" from SRC/REF, clearly altering the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:**  	- "Ölarbeiter der Nordsee" in HYP and "Nordeseeölarbeiter" in REF both adequately translate "North Sea oil workers" from SRC, despite a slight structural difference.	- "nehmen die Gespräche wieder auf" in HYP and "nehmen wieder Gespräche auf" in REF both translate "resume talks" from SRC, showing a minor difference in word order but no major meaning change.	- "unterbrechen den Streik" in HYP and "setzen Streik aus" in REF both translate "suspend strike" from SRC, meaning the same action of pausing or halting the strike.
Arbeitskämpfe → Laborstreiks → Arbeitskämpfe  	Streitparteien → Konfliktparteien → Streitparteien
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation correctly conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence without significant errors. Both HYP and REF cover the same meaning, despite minor structural differences.
Unions → können → Gewerkschaften
Anfang nächster Woche → Anfang nächsten Jahres → Starting next week  		**Explanation:** "Anfang nächster Woche" in HYP (meaning "early next week") is a mistranslation of "starting early next week" from SRC as compared to "Anfang nächsten Jahres" in REF (meaning "early next year").
labor unions → Arbeitergewerkschaften → Gewerkschaften  	action → Aktion → Streik  		**Explanation:**  	- "Arbeitergewerkschaften" in HYP is a mistranslation of "labor unions"/"Gewerkschaften" from SRC/REF, as it specifically refers to "workers' unions," which adds an unnecessary specificity not present in the SRC.	- "Aktion" in HYP is a mistranslation of "action"/"Streik" from SRC/REF, where "Streik" translates to "strike," fitting the context better as it implies a particular form of protest action.
Wood → Holz → Wood  	group → gruppe → Group  		**Explanation:** The word "Wood" refers to a proper noun, the name of a specific company ("Wood Group"), and should not be translated as "Holz," which means "wood" in the context of material. Similarly, "Group" as part of a proper noun should not be translated to "gruppe."
company's rate → Unternehmensquote → Ratenkürzung  	offshore → Offshore → Onshore
No translation errors detected.
trimmed → getrocknet → entlassen  	payroll → Gehältern → Leuten  		**Explanation:** "Getrocknet" in HYP is a mistranslation for "trimmed" from SRC, the correct term "entlassen" in REF retains the intended meaning of reducing workforce. "Gehältern" in HYP does not correctly convey "payroll" from SRC, with "Leuten" in REF providing a correct contextual fit.
No translation errors detected.
Member of Parliament → Abgeordnete → Parlamentsmitglied  	labor leaders → Laborführern → Arbeiterführern  		**Explanation:**   	- "Abgeordnete" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Member of Parliament" compared to "Parlamentsmitglied" in REF.	- "Laborführern" in HYP mistranslates "labor leaders" compared to "Arbeiterführern" in REF. The meaning is altered as "Laborführer" suggests a different connotation possibly linked with "Labor" in a more abstract form, rather than "workers" or "Arbeiter" which is a common understanding in the labor context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The translation in HYP accurately conveys the meaning and context of the SRC sentence. The word order difference is minor and does not affect the understanding or accuracy of the translation. Both HYP and REF align well with the original English sentence's intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately represents the meaning of the SRC sentence and aligns well with the REF translation. There are no single-word errors that significantly alter the meaning or context.
**(SRC word → HYP word → Correct REF word)**		spending → ausgegeben → Ausgaben  	expected → erreicht → erwartet
Kepler measures → Kepler-Maßnahmen → Kepler misst  	spin rates → spritzen → Rotationsrate  	stars → Sternraten → Sternen  	in → aus → im
latest → jüngste → neueste  	space telescope → Weltraum-Telescope → Weltraumteleskop  	spin rates → Spitzenraten → Rotationsraten  	Pleiades → Pleidas → Plejaden  		**Explanation:**  	- "Jüngste" is a mistranslation of "latest" when compared to "neueste" in the REF, which aligns more closely with the intended meaning of "most recent".	- "Weltraum-Telescope" is incorrectly hyphenated and should be "Weltraumteleskop" to correctly translate "space telescope" without breaking the word.	- "Spitzenraten" is a mistranslation for "spin rates", which should be "Rotationsraten" as used in REF.	- "Pleidas" is a misspelling of "Pleiades", which should be "Plejaden" to match the standard German spelling for this star cluster.
Stars → Stars → Sterne  	Streubomben → Streubomben → Sternenhaufen  	Geschwindigkeiten → Geschwindigkeiten → Raten  	Weltbildung → Weltbildung → Planetenentstehung  		**Explanation:** 	- "Stars" in HYP is a direct mistranslation of "stars", which should be "Sterne" as given in REF. 	- "Streubomben" is an incorrect translation of "cluster" (correct translation is "Sternenhaufen").	- "Geschwindigkeiten" means "speeds", but "Raten" (rates) fits the context better.	- "Weltbildung" is a significant mistranslation for "planet formation", for which "Planetenentstehung" is the correct term.
Star-Clustern → Sternenhaufen → Sternenhaufen  	Solar → Sonnensystem → Sonnensystem  	Forschungswissenschaftler → Forscherin → Forscherin  	Information → Infrared → Infrared  	Analyse → Analysis → Analysis  	Mitteilung → Pressemitteilung → Pressemitteilung  		**Explanation:** The words "Star-Clustern," "Solar," "Forschungswissenschaftler," "Information," "Analyse," and "Mitteilung" in the HYP sentence are mistranslations that significantly alter the meaning when compared to both the SRC and REF.
Pleiades → Plediads → Plejaden  	cluster → Cluster → Sternenhaufen  		**Explanation:** "Plediads" in HYP is a mistyped version of "Pleiades"/"Plejaden" from SRC/REF, and "Cluster" in HYP, while technically a correct translation for "cluster," doesn't accurately match the term "Sternenhaufen" used in the reference.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation "Sie spinnen so schnell wie je zuvor." captures the essence of the SRC sentence and doesn't contain significant errors when compared to the REF translation, which similarly conveys the high speed context. Minor phrasing differences do not constitute a clear mistranslation in this context.
spin → Spitzen → Spitzenrotations  	eject → pumpen → stoßen  	stellar → stiflen → Sternwinden  
stars → Stars → Sterne
star → Sterne → Stern  	spin → Spitzenrate → Rotationsrate  
measures → Maßnahmen → misst  	star's → Starts → Sterns  	appearance → Auftreten → Erscheinen  	starspots → Sonnenspots → Sternenflecks  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Maßnahmen" in HYP means "measures" as actions, while "misst" in REF means "measures" as in measuring.  	2. "Starts" in HYP refers to the beginning or launch, while "Sterns" in REF is the correct translation for "star's."  	3. "Auftreten" in HYP means "occurrence," while "Erscheinen" in REF correctly translates to "appearance."  	4. "Sonnenspots" in HYP translates to "sunspots," while "Sternenflecks" in REF correctly translates to "starspots."
spin → ausbrechen → drehen
Rebull → Rebellen → Rebull  	likens → vergleichen → vergleicht  	dancers → Tanzern → Tänzern  	pirouetting → *omitted in HYP* → Pirouetten drehen  	stars → Stars → Sterne
- Pleiaden → Plejaden → Plejaden	- Rotatoren → Rotoren → Rotoren	- Lichtsterne → helle → helle		**Explanation:**  	1. "Pleiaden" in the HYP is a variation of "Plejaden" from the REF, which adheres more closely to the correct German spelling of "Pleiades."	2. "Rotatoren" in HYP does not exactly match "Rotoren" in REF, where "Rotoren" is the correct contextual translation for "rotators."	3. "Lichtsterne" in HYP translates to "light stars," whereas "helle" in REF correctly conveys the intended meaning of "very bright stars" or "very light stars."
Pleiades → Pleidas → Plejaden  	cluster → Cluster → Sternenhaufen  	stellar → Stückwerte → stellare  	spin rates → Spitzenzöllen → Rotationsraten
Pleiaden → Plejaden → Plejaden  	stillarer → stellaren → stellaren  		**Explanation:**  	- "Pleiaden" is a mistranslation of "Plejaden," as the latter is the proper translation used for "Pleiades" in German.  	- "Stillarer" in HYP is a mistranslation of "stellaren" from REF, which is the correct translation of "stellar" in the context of star-related models.
spin → Spitzenzinsen → Rotationsraten  		**Explanation:** In the context of the sentence, "spin" refers to the rotation or speed of the stars. The correct translation would be "Rotationsraten" as in REF. The HYP word "Spitzenzinsen" inaccurately translates "spin" and significantly changes the meaning.
detaile → ausführlich dargelegt → ausführlich berichtet  	papers → Dokumenten → Zeitungsberichten  	spin rates → [missing translation] → Rotationsraten  	Astronomical Journal → Astronomische Amtsblatt → Astronomical Journal  		**Explanation:**  	1. "ausführlich dargelegt" in HYP diverges from "detaile" in SRC, where "ausführlich berichtet" is a more fitting translation from REF.	2. "Dokumenten" in HYP does not capture the specificity of "papers" in SRC, which is given as "Zeitungsberichten" in REF.	3. The phrase "spin rates" appears in SRC, but no equivalent is present in HYP, whereas "Rotationsraten" in REF translates it correctly.	4. "Astronomische Amtsblatt" in HYP is an incorrect translation for "Astronomical Journal" in SRC, which remains the same in REF.
Baseball → Basel-Sterner → Baseball-Star  	steps down → [missing] → tritt ab
Baseball-Star → Basel-Stern → Baseball-Star  		**Explanation:** "Basel-Stern" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Baseball-Star" from SRC/REF, significantly changing the meaning and context.
Pro → Pro → Profi  	Jankeesy → Jankeesy → Yankees  	Bucht → Bucht → Bay  		**Explanation:**  	- "Pro" in HYP does not adequately translate to "Profi" from the REF, which is closer to the SRC meaning of "pro."	- "Jankeesy" appears to be a typographical error or incorrect form in HYP for "Yankees," as seen in the REF.	- "Bucht" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Bay" from the SRC and "Bay" in REF, which should remain untranslated as part of the team name "Tampa Bay Rays."
No translation errors detected.
1. All Star → Star → All-Star-Game-Teilnehmer  	2. zu → von → zu  		**Explanation:**  	- "All Star" in HYP is a mistranslation of "All-Star-Game-Teilnehmer" from REF, which keeps the original context from SRC.  	- "von" in HYP does not accurately translate the phrase "goodbye to" which should use "zu" in this context as per REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** All words in HYP align correctly with the SRC and correspond well with the REF, maintaining the intended meaning across the sentences. The choice of words and translations contextually match, with no significant discrepancies.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence accurately when compared with the REF translation. The differences are stylistic rather than due to mistranslation of specific words.
contract → Vertrags → Kontrakts  	coach → Jugendbus → Jugendcoach  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence captures the overall meaning and intent of the SRC sentence in a way that doesn't significantly deviate from the REF sentence in terms of key content words.
home → Hausfahrten → Homeruns  	hits → Höhen → Hits  	points → Punkte → Punkten  	runs → läuft → Runs  		**Explanation:**  	- "Hausfahrten" erroneously translates "home runs" instead of using the standard term "Homeruns".  	- "Höhen" mistakenly translates "hits", which should be "Hits" as used in the REF.  	- "Punkte" instead of "Punkten" and "läuft" instead of "Runs" suggest mistranslations that affect the flow and accuracy in a baseball context.
Hall of Fame → Hall of Women → Hall-of-Fame
However → jedoch → Doch  	cannot → können → dürfte  	be → werden → aufgenommen  	Baseball → Basballhalle → Ruhmeshalle des Baseballs  		**Explanation:**  	- "However" is mistakenly translated to "jedoch", and "doch" would be a more contextually suitable option.	- "Cannot" in this context is better translated to "dürfte nicht" instead of "können nicht", showing a certainty and suggestion rather than ability or permission.	- The actual phrase for "be welcomed" is part of a misunderstanding in the HYP with "werden", while the REF provides a more suitable "aufgenommen" for the context.	- "Baseball" is mistranslated as "Basballhalle" instead of the more contextual "Ruhmeshalle des Baseballs".
Rodriguez → Nacken → Spitzname  	pitch → Spielfeld → Feld  	off → vom → außerhalb  	behaviour → Verhalten → Auftreten  		**Explanation:**  	- "Nacken" in HYP is a mistranslation of "nickname"/"Spitzname" from SRC/REF. "Nacken" means "neck," which does not fit contextually.	- "Spielfeld" in HYP mismatches "pitch"/"Feld" from both SRC/REF. "Spielfeld" is more like "playing field," while "Feld" aligns more with the intended "pitch."	- "Vom" in HYP incorrectly represents "off"/"außerhalb" from SRC/REF. "Vom" implies "from" which is not quite the same as "off" or "outside."	- "Verhalten" in HYP does translate "behaviour" but pacing-wise, "Auftreten" is closer in this context to complement the controversy mentioned, matching better with the SRC/REF.
told → erzählte → gab zu  	banned → verboten → verbotene  		**Explanation:** The word "told" is incorrectly translated as "erzählte" in HYP while the REF accurately uses "gab zu," which aligns with the context of admitting wrongdoing. Additionally, "banned" is mistranslated as "verboten" when it should be "verbotene" to properly describe "Steroide" in the given context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words in HYP, such as "verboten" and "Beteiligung," effectively capture the meaning of the SRC sentence, despite some variance from REF, which uses "gesperrt" and "Verwicklung." These differences do not constitute significant mistranslations given the context and meaning are preserved.
accused → über → jahrelang  	enhancing → Leistungssteigerung → leistungsfördernde  		**Explanation:**  	- "Über" in HYP is a mistranslation of "accused" from the SRC and does not match the REF's translation of "als Hauptverdächtiger".	- "Leistungssteigerung" in HYP translates to "enhancement," but this changes the meaning from "leistungsfördernde" (performance-enhancing) in REF.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "Verbot" and "Sperre" both translate to "ban", while "Spiele" and "Begegnungen" both translate to "matches", showing synonym variations. There is no significant change in meaning.
1. done → tun → getan  	2. summing → zusammengefaßt → süffisant  		**Explanation:** "tun" in HYP is a mistranslation of "done"/"getan" from SRC/REF, and "zusammengefaßt" in HYP does not capture the same nuance as "summed up"/"süffisant" from SRC/REF, affecting the intended meaning and tone.
Even → Selbst → Auch  	bang → Bankrott → geräuschlos  		**Explanation:**  	- "Even" in SRC corresponds to "Auch" in REF, while "Selbst" in HYP slightly changes the emphasis but still fits the overall meaning, so it's noted for context.	- "bang" in the SRC is a metaphorical expression meaning "with a significant event," whereas "Bankrott" in HYP translates to "bankruptcy," which changes the context and meaning significantly.
Baseball legends → Basellends → Baseball-Legenden  	stage → Phase → Bühne
job → Arbeit → Job  	retirement → Pension → Abschieds  
job → Aufgabe → Job  	buss → Coach → Coach
Rodriguez → Rodriguez → Rodriguez  	leiden → zu leiden → was  	Achse → Achse → Schauspielerin  	erzürnenden → erzürnenden → Erzrivalen  	Rote → Rote → Red  		**Explanation:**  	- "zu leiden" in HYP is a mistranslation of "war"/"was" in SRC/REF in the context of Rodriguez's relationship status.	- "Achse" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Schauspielerin"/"actress" as it contextually refers to Kate Hudson.	- "erzürnenden" in HYP is an incorrect translation of "Erzrivalen"/"arch rivals" affecting the context of the sentence.	- "Rote" in HYP should be "Red" sufficiently translating "Red" from SRC/REF for Boston Red Sox.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The translation in HYP adequately conveys the meaning and context of the SRC, aligning acceptably with the REF. There are no significant single-word mistranslations present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The translation provided in HYP accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence when compared to both SRC and REF. Differences such as "Olympische Spiele" vs. "Olympia" are negligible and contextually appropriate.
Busted → Bust → Erwischt  	sample → Stichprobenprobe → Dopingprobe  	weightlifter → Gewichtsteller → Gewichtheber  	Zielinksi → Zinksi → Zielinski  	compete → konkurrieren → starten  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both HYP and REF correctly convey the meaning of the SRC sentence in German. The differences involve tense ("wurden" vs. "werden"), which does not significantly alter the meaning as both fit grammatically depending on context.
One → Eine → Eine  	now-banned → erwischte → erwischte  	athlete → Athletin → Athletin  	had → hätte → hätte  	No → gewonnen → gewonnen  		**Explanation:**	- "One" is mistranslated as "Ein" in HYP, while it should be "Eine" as in REF.	- "now-banned" is mistranslated as "verbotener" in HYP, while it should be "erwischte" as in REF.	- "athlete" is mistranslated as "Sportler" in HYP, while it should be "Athletin" as in REF.	- "had" is mistranslated as "hatte" in HYP, while it should be "hätte" as in REF.	- "No" significant mistranslation for "gewonnen."
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words in HYP provide a correct translation of the source sentence and are well-aligned with both the source and reference sentences in terms of meaning and context.
1. 3000-meter → 300-Meter-Hüller → 3000-Meter-Hindernisläuferin  	2. Polish → Polen → polnische  	3. weightlifter → Schwerwächter → Gewichtheber
Hydrochlorothiazide → Chlorothiazid → Hydrochlorothiazid
1. banned → verboten → Ausschluss		**Explanation:** "verboten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "banned"/"Ausschluss" from SRC/REF, as "verboten" generally means "forbidden," fitting less accurately than "Ausschluss," which means "exclusion" or "banishment" in this context.
18-year-old → 18-jährige → 18-Jährige  	fourth → 4 → vierten  	final → Fall → Finale  	Butterfly → Butterfly → Schmetterling  		**Explanation:**  	1. "18-Jährige" in the REF correctly indicates a female "18-year-old", while "18-jährige" in HYP is a gender-neutral term, which may not align with the context.	2. "vierten" in the REF is a correct ordinal form for "fourth", while "4" in HYP uses a numeral that doesn't fit the formal register of the sentence.	3. "Finale" in REF correctly translates "final", while "Fall" in HYP is contextually inappropriate since "Fall" means "case."	4. "Schmetterling" translates to "Butterfly", appropriately used in REF, while "Butterfly" remains untranslated in HYP.	
50m → 50m → 50 m  	Freisyle-Hitzen → Freisyle-Hitzen → Vorläufen über 50 m Freistil  		**Explanation:**  	- "50m" in HYP should be written with a space as "50 m" to match REF's usage.	- "Freisyle-Hitzen" is a mistranslation compared to "Vorläufen über 50 m Freistil" in REF. "Freisyle" is misspelled and should be "Freistil" in the context of swimming races, and "Hitzen" is an incorrect translation for "heats," which is more accurately translated as "Vorlaufen."
for a hearing → zur Anhörung → eine Anhörung  	to have → zur Eröffnung → die Öffnung  	her → seiner → ihrer  		**Explanation:** "zur" in HYP suggests a destination rather than the action of requesting a hearing ("eine Anhörung"), altering the meaning. "zur Eröffnung" (to {the} opening) in HYP mismatches "die Öffnung" (the opening) referring to requesting an action. "seiner" is a gender or possession error, as it should match "her" ("ihre" in German).
asks → bittet → verlangt  	press → Pressemitteilung → Mitteilung  	decision → Entscheidung → Urteil  
- positive → positive → positiven		**Explanation:** The word "positive" in HYP directly uses the English word, whereas REF correctly uses the contextually fitting German equivalent "positiven," which aligns with the SRC context of "people who test positive."
Danekowa → Danekowa → Danekowa  	33-jähriger → 33-Jährige → 33-Jährige  		**Explanation:** The SRC sentence suggests that Danekowa is female ("the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself"), corroborated by the REF translation which uses "33-Jährige" to indicate a female. The HYP translation incorrectly uses "33-jähriger," suggesting a male, which is a significant mistranslation. Other words concerning Danekowa remain the same across all sentences and do not form errors.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The difference between "Nahrungsergänzungen" in HYP and "Nahrungsergänzungsmittel" in REF is minor and doesn't significantly alter the meaning. Similarly, "Athletin" and "Leichtathletin" both adequately convey the concept of an athlete, with the latter being slightly more specific. Thus, there are no significant single-word translation errors affecting the meaning.
banned → Stoff → Substanz  	chemical → Chemie → Mittel  	EPA → EPA → EPO  
sample → Stichprobe → Probe  	postive → getestet → positiv  		**Explanation:** "Stichprobe" in HYP is a mistranslation of "sample"/"Probe," and "getestet" in HYP is a mistranslation of "positive"/"positiv" from SRC/REF. Both changes affect the meaning and context of the sentence.
Bulgaria's → Der bulgarische → Bulgariens  	athlete → Sportler → Athletin  
1. draw → ziehen → ziehen (No error in this translation as both HYP and REF use "ziehen", which means "draw".)	2. conclusions → Schlussfolgerungen → Schlüsse  		**Explanation:** "Schlussfolgerungen" in HYP and "Schlüsse" in REF translate differently. However, both options convey the meaning of conclusions, with the REF being a shorter form. No critical mistranslation here.		3. observation → beobachtet → Beobachtung  	4. banned → verboten → ausgeschlossen worden  		**Explanation:** "verboten" (HYP) translates to "forbidden" or "prohibited," whereas "ausgeschlossen worden" (REF) translates to "have been excluded," which aligns better with the intended context of having been banned from participation.		**Final Output:**  	observation → beobachtet → Beobachtung  	banned → verboten → ausgeschlossen worden
weightlifters → Gewichtshubschrauber → Gewichtheber  		**Explanation:** "Gewichtshubschrauber" in HYP is a mistranslation of "weightlifters"/"Gewichtheber" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the meaning.
Zielinski → Zinski → Zielinski  	durchgeführt → getestet → getestet  	anabolische → anabole → anabole  	Steroide → Steroid → Steroid  
deny → leugnen → bestreiten  	neither → es → beide  	compete → konkurrieren → starten  		**Explanation:**  	- "leugnen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "deny"/"bestreiten" from SRC/REF, more accurately translated as "bestreiten."  	- "es" in HYP is a mistranslation of "neither"/"beide" from SRC/REF, changing the intended meaning.  	- "konkurrieren" in HYP is not contextually fitting for "compete"/"starten" within the given weight category context, where "starten" is more appropriate.
Athletes → Athleten → Leichtathleten  	Case → Fall → besonders  		**Explanation:** "Athleten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Leichtathleten" from REF, as it lacks the specificity of "track and field athletes." "Fall" in HYP does not capture the emphasis implied by "besonders" in the REF translation.
1. Federation → Föderation → Verband  	2. IAAF → IAF → IAAF  	3. running → regierende → Läufernation  		**Explanation:**  	- "Föderation" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Federation" from SRC, which should be "Verband" as in REF.	- "IAAF" is mistranslated as "IAF" in HYP, which is not the correct acronym as reflected in both the SRC and REF.	- "regierende" in HYP is a mistranslation of "running" in SRC, which should be translated as "Läufernation" in REF to fit the context of an athletic context.
offence → Straftat → Vergehen  		**Explanation:** "Straftat" in HYP is a mistranslation of "offence"/"Vergehen" from SRC/REF, changing the intended meaning in the context of sports disputes.
No translation errors detected.
Sun → Sonne → Sun  	pee → Frieden → pinkelt  	purple → ples → lila  
200m → 200 → 200 m  	throw up → antreten → mich übergeben
No translation errors detected.
time → Zeit → Zeit  	respect → Achtung → Respekt  	drug cheats → Drogenbetrügern → Doping-Betrüger		**Explanation:**  	- "Achtung" in HYP is a mistranslation in the context; the correct translation of "respect" is "Respekt," as seen in REF.	- "Drogenbetrügern" in HYP is a mistranslation; the more specific context of "drug cheats" refers to "Doping-Betrüger," emphasizing the context of cheating in a sports-related setting. 	- "Ich habe keine Zeit" is correctly translated in both HYP and REF, with "Zeit" being accurately translated as itself.
tested → getestet → getestet worden  	Verbot → Verbot → Sperre  		**Explanation:**  	- "getestet" in HYP lacks the auxiliary form "worden," which is present in the REF "getestet worden" to properly convey the passive sense of "tested."  	- "Verbot" in HYP translates to "ban" but in context, "Sperre" from REF better conveys the specific meaning of a sports suspension or disqualification, referred to as "sit out" in SRC.
Data theft → Datendiebstahl → Datenklau  	ransom money → Erpressungsgelder → Lösegeld
Programmers → Programme → Programmierer  	extortion → erpresserischen → Erpressungs  	are targeting → richten sich an → greifen an  	success → erfolgreich → sind dabei erfolgreich
1. survey → Umfrage → Umfrage  	2. Malwarebytes → Malwarebyten → Malwarebytes  	3. extortion → Erpressungssoftware → Erpresser-Software  		**Explanation:**		- "Umfrage" and "Umfrage" correctly translate "survey".	- "Malwarebytes" should remain consistent ('Malwarebytes') and not change to 'Malwarebyten' in the HYP.	- "Erpressungssoftware" in HYP and "Erpresser-Software" in REF both accurately translate "extortion software", but considering consistency, the terminology in REF is preferred.		Note: "Vereinigten Königreich" and "Großbritannien" are viable translations for "the UK", showing a minor synonym variation.
Ranosware → Ransomware-Erpressung
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation (HYP) effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Any differences between HYP and REF reflect variations in word choice or structure that do not alter the essential meaning.
Nach → Die → laut  	Malwarebyten → Malwarebytes → Malwarebytes  	festzustellen → spezialisieren → spezialisieren  	Erpressungssoftware → Erpresser-Software → Erpresser-Software  	Ausrichten → spezialisieren → spezialisieren  	Angriffe → Attacken → Attacken  	Unternehmensnetzwerke → Firmennetzwerke → Firmennetzwerke  
ransom → Löschgeld → Lösegeld		**Explanation:** "Löschgeld" is a mistranslation of "ransom"/"Lösegeld" from SRC/REF, altering the intended meaning.
Malwarebyts → Malwarebytes → Malwarebytes  	Die Welt → Welt → Welt  		**Explanation:** "Malwarebyts" in the HYP is a misspelling of "Malwarebytes" from SRC/REF. The phrase "Die Welt" is placed incorrectly, it should match the format and style of "Welt" as in the reference translation context.
No translation errors detected.   		**Explanation:** The words and structure in the HYP sentence accurately capture the meaning of the SRC sentence and are sufficiently aligned with the REF translation. There are no significant mistranslation errors that change the meaning.

**edited → ausgelegt → verändert**  		**files → Akten → Dateien**  		**have not been → seit langem nicht mehr → unlängst**  		**user's → Nutzers → Opfers**  		**Word → Wort → Word**  		**Explanation:** 		1. "ausgelegt" is a mistranslation of "edited" from SRC and "verändert" from REF, changing the intended meaning of the action performed on the files.		2. "Akten" is used in HYP for "files," while "Dateien" is used in REF, which fits better with the context of digital files.		3. The phrase "seit langem nicht mehr" ("for a long time") reverses the intended meaning from the source and reference ("not been edited" vs. "unlängst" meaning "recently").		4. "Nutzers" translates to "user's" in a more general sense, but "Opfers" in REF fits the context of the sentence referring to a victim of ransomware.		5. "Wort" in HYP is mistranslated from "Word," which refers specifically to the Microsoft Word program. The correct translation, "Word," is reflected in the REF.
encrypts → verschlüsselt → verschlüsselt  	files → Akten → Dateien  	originals → Ursprünge → Originale  		**Explanation:** "Akten" and "Ursprünge" in HYP are mistranslations of "files"/"Dateien" and "originals"/"Originale" from SRC/REF, respectively. These changes significantly alter the meaning and context. No error in the translation of "encrypts," as both HYP and REF correctly use "verschlüsselt" for the source word.
extortioner's → Urhebers → Erpresser
Bitcoins → Bitmünzen → Bitcoin  	decryption → Deckung → Endschlüsselungs  		**Explanation:**  	- "Bitmünzen" in the HYP is a mistranslation of "Bitcoin" from both SRC and REF, as "Bitcoin" is typically not translated and remains the same across languages.	- "Deckung" in the HYP refers to "decryption" in SRC, which is translated in REF as "Endschlüsselungs", indicating that "Deckung" is a contextual mistranslation.
No translation errors detected.
damage → Ranomastoff → Schaden  	ransomware → Ranomastoff → Ransomware  		**Explanation:** "Ranomastoff" in HYP is a mistranslation of both "damage" and "ransomware" in SRC/REF, changing the meaning and context significantly.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately conveys the meaning and key elements of the SRC sentence, and while there are small variations in phrasing compared to the REF, they do not change the overall meaning or context significantly. The translation choices in HYP are valid and appropriate.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation adequately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence and aligns well with the REF translation. The differences between "Anschlägen" and "Attacken," as well as "medizinischen Unterlagen" and "Krankenakten," are minor and do not significantly alter the meaning or context.
No translation errors detected.
percent → % → Prozent  	companies → Unternehmen → Firmen  	files → Akten → Daten  		**Explanation:** "percent" is translated as "%" in HYP, whereas "Prozent" is the appropriate term as shown in REF. "Companies" is translated to "Unternehmen" in HYP, while "Firmen" is used in REF, though this is a minor discrepancy in context. "Files" is translated as "Akten" in HYP, which changes the context compared to "Daten" in REF.
No translation errors detected.
Then again → Auch → wiederum  	build → tun → versuchen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Auch" in HYP incorrectly translates "Then again" from SRC, whereas "wiederum" in REF is the correct translation.  	2. "tun" in HYP incorrectly translates "build" from SRC, whereas "versuchen" in REF is the correct translation.
F-Secure → aus → von  	user interfaces → Benutzergruppen → Nutzeroberflächen  	contact → Kontakt treten → den Kontakt  		**Explanation:**  	1. "aus" in HYP is a mistranslation, while "von" in REF correctly translates "from" in SRC.	2. "Benutzergruppen" in HYP means "user groups", which does not correctly translate "user interfaces". The REF uses "Nutzeroberflächen", which aligns with SRC.	3. "Kontakt treten" in HYP means "make contact", which distorts the meaning of "contact". REF uses "den Kontakt", which accurately captures the meaning.
Mistranslations:  	BitmMünzen → BitmMünzen → Bitcoin  	verschlüsselte → verschlüsselte → entschlüsseln  
companies → Unternehmen → Unternehmen  	bargain → feilschen → verhandeln  	decrypted → entstellen → unverschlüsselt  		**Explanation:**  	- "feilschen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "bargain"/"verhandeln" from SRC/REF, as "feilschen" implies haggling rather than negotiating.	- "entstellen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "decrypted"/"unverschlüsselt" from SRC/REF, as "entstellen" means to distort or disfigure, not decrypt.
Ranosware → Ransomware → Ransomware  	Antikir-Provider → Antivirus-Anbieter → Antivirus-Anbieter  		**Explanation:** "Ranosware" in HYP is a mistranslation of "ransomware" from REF, significantly changing the meaning. Similarly, "Antikir-Provider" should be "Antivirus-Anbieter," which corresponds to the REF, indicating a mistranslation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words in HYP ("wahrscheinlicher", "drei", "vier", "Personen", "beteiligt") match the meaning conveyed in the SRC sentence and correctly align with the intended meaning in the REF translation. There are syntactic and stylistic differences but no significant mistranslations.
malware → Malware → Schadsoftware  	set → Reihe → Baukasten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Malware" in HYP should be translated as "Schadsoftware" according to the REF.  	2. "Reihe" in HYP is a mistranslation of "set" and should be "Baukasten" as in the REF.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation effectively communicates the original sentence's meaning in German with no significant mistranslations of single words compared to the source and reference sentences. Variations like "Werkzeuge" vs. "Tools" are synonymous and do not change the overall meaning.
kits → Kitte → Lieferumfang  	tool → Instrument → Tool  	branding → Marken → Branding  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Kitte" in HYP mistranslates "kits" from SRC, while REF uses "Lieferumfang" to capture the correct meaning.  	2. "Instrument" in HYP mistranslates "tool" from both SRC and REF, which use "Tool" instead.  	3. "Marken" in HYP mistranslates "branding" from SRC, while REF uses "Branding" to correctly convey the original meaning.
prepared → vorbereitete → eingekaufte
No translation errors detected.
log → setzen sich ein → loggt sich ein  	set → Decke → Set  		**Explanation:** "Setzen sich ein" in HYP is a mistranslation of "loggt sich ein" from REF, as it fails to convey the action of logging in. "Decke" in HYP is an incorrect translation of "set" from SRC and should be "Set" as per REF. These changes significantly affect the intended meaning of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence and REF sentence both accurately convey the meaning of the SRC sentence. The use of "Computer" (HYP) and "Rechner" (REF) are interchangeable synonyms in this context, and therefore, no significant translation errors are present.
task → betrachten → beauftragen  	distribution → Vertrieb → Verbreitung  		**Explanation:** "Betrachten" in HYP wrongly translates "task"/"beauftragen" from SRC/REF, and "Vertrieb" in HYP is a mistranslation of "distribution"/"Verbreitung" given the context.
risks → Risiken → Risiko  	Ranosware → Ransomware → Ransomware  		**Explanation:** In the HYP, "Risiken" can be considered a pluralization error when compared to the singular usage "Risiko" in the REF. Moreover, "Ranosware" is a typographical error for "Ransomware," directly impacting the meaning significantly.
1. companies' → Computerspezialisten → Firmen-IT-Verantwortlichen  	2. Maywarebytes' → Mayrebyts → Malwarebytes  	3. file → Akten → Datei  	4. ransomware → Ransomare → Ransomware  		**Explanation:** Each identified mistranslation changes the meaning or introduces errors not present in the source or reference translations.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The phrase "As a result" is translated in HYP as "daher" and in REF as "dementsprechend." Both translations are contextually appropriate and convey the intended meaning. The rest of the sentence, including "perpetrators already trying out new strategies," is effectively conveyed in both HYP ("Die Täter erproben daher bereits neue Strategien.") and REF ("Dementsprechend verfolgen die Täter bereits neue Strategien."). There are no significant meaning changes.
encrypting → Auflistung → Verschlüsselung
risk → Risikopotenzial → Schadenspotential  	file → Unterlagen → Daten  		**Explanation:** "Risikopotenzial" in HYP translates "risk potential," but "Schadenspotential" in REF suggests a context-specific term "damage potential," presenting a significant meaning shift. Furthermore, "Unterlagen" (documents) is a less accurate translation for "file" compared to "Daten" (data), as indicated in REF.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "Täter" (HYP) accurately translates "perpetrators" (SRC), "konzentrieren" (HYP) maps to "focus themselves" (SRC), and the rest of the sentence captures the meaning adequately. The differences between HYP and REF are minor and do not indicate clear errors based on the given context.
Defcon → Decco → Defcon  	demonstrierten → gezeigt → demonstrierten  		**Explanation:** "Decco" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Defcon" from SRC/REF, which is a proper noun and should remain the same. "gezeigt" in HYP does not accurately capture the sense of "demonstrieren" from REF, which is more precise in the context of demonstrating capabilities at a conference.
Opfer → Opfer → Opfer  	würden → könnten → könnte  	zahlen → wert → einen  	zurückkehrt → Freischaltung → blockierten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "würden" in HYP is a mistranslation of "könnte"/"könnten" from SRC/REF, altering the hypothetical nature.	2. "zahlen" in HYP mistranslates as "Freischaltung" where an affecting action is indicated as opposed to direct payment.	3. "zurückkehrt" in HYP incorrectly implies "return" instead of "allowing/having it turned back on" aligning with "Freischaltung" in REF.		**Correct REF Word Notes:**  	- "könnte" and "könnten" capture the conditional modality better than "würden".	- "Freischaltung" appropriately conveys the context of getting the heating operational again compared to "zurückkehrt" which implies a return with different meaning.
hackers → Hacker → Täter  	switch off → abschalten → blockieren  	ransomware → Stromware → Ransomware  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** While the HYP differs from the REF, both adequately convey the meaning of the SRC, i.e., catering to every situation or case, with no single-word mistranslations altering the context significantly.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation (HYP) adequately conveys the meaning of the source sentence (SRC) and the reference translation (REF). "Praktisch" and "perfekt für den Alltag" in HYP are suitable translations for "practical" and "perfect for everyday use", which align well with "flexibel" and "alltagstauglich" in REF, given the context. Therefore, while there are variations in wording, they do not result in any significant change in meaning.
HR-V → HR-Flügel → HR-V  	Coupé → Copé → Coupé  	Minivan → Minivan → Minivans
No translation errors detected.
HR-V → LKW-Maut → HR-V  	squeeze → Pause → eng
The errors identified are:		craft → gezeichnet → verarbeitet  	dashboard → Oberfläche → Cockpit-Oberseite  		**Explanation:**  	- "gezeichnet" in HYP is a mistranslation of "crafted"/"verarbeitet" in SRC/REF, changing the meaning of the sentence.	- "Oberfläche" in HYP is a mistranslation of "dashboard"/"Cockpit-Oberseite" from SRC/REF, which alters the intended meaning.
HR-V → LKW-Fahrzeuge → HR-V
453 l oben → 453 l oben → 453 l bei hochgestellten  	1026 l unten → 1026 l unten → 1026 l bei umgeklappten  		**Explanation:** The phrases "oben" and "unten" in HYP are not accurate translations of the specific meanings "bei hochgestellten" and "bei umgeklappten" from REF that describe the position of the seats (up and down). This significantly alters the intended meaning related to seat configuration.
seats → Sitze → Sitzflächen  	flipped up → aufgefüllt → hochklappen  	ceiling → Obergrenze → Decke  
boot → Kabine → Kofferraum  		**Explanation:** "Kabine" in HYP is a mistranslation of "boot"/"Kofferraum" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the meaning in the context of car features.
1. torque → Torheit → Drehmoment  	2. m → m → Nm  	3. Fahrzeuge → Fahrzeuge → V  		**Explanation:**  	- "Torheit" is a mistranslation of "torque"/"Drehmoment", significantly altering the sentence's technical context.  	- "m" in HYP should be "Nm" as in REF to accurately represent "Nm" in the source.  	- "HR-Fahrzeuge" should be "HR-V" to match the specific vehicle name used in the source and REF.
However → Sie → Allerdings  	it → Sie → Er  	quietly → ruhiger → leiser  		**Explanation:**  	- "However" is incorrectly translated as "Sie" in HYP when "Allerdings" is appropriate as in REF.  	- "it" should be "Er" in REF, but is incorrectly translated as "Sie" in HYP.  	- "quietly" is better translated as "leiser" in REF, whereas "ruhiger" in HYP changes the nuance.
No translation errors detected.
1. additional → Zusatzmotor → weitere Motorisierung  	2. petrol engine → Benzinmotoren → Benziner  		**Explanation:** "Zusatzmotor" in HYP incorrectly conveys "additional" instead of "weitere Motorisierung" from REF. Additionally, "Benzinmotoren" should be singular "Benziner" to align with the singular "1.5 l petrol engine" in the SRC and REF.
All-wheel drive → Allradfahrer → Allradantrieb  	is → sind → wird
Its → Ihr → Das  	handling → Umgang → Fahrverhalten  	speed → Geschwindigkeit → Dynamik  
No translation errors detected.
fittings → Anpassungen → Ausstattung  		**Explanation:** "Anpassungen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "fittings"/"Ausstattung" from SRC/REF, which significantly changes the meaning and context.
Notbremsassistent → City-Notbremsassistent → City-Notbremsassistent  	Spurenabwarnsystem → Spurhalteassistent → Spurhalteassistent  		**Explanation:**  	- "Notbremsassistent" in HYP omits the "City" part present in both SRC and REF, making it potentially ambiguous in context.	- "Spurenabwarnsystem" in HYP is a mistranslation for "lane departure warning system," which correlates contextually to "Spurhalteassistent" in REF.
warning → Kollisionswarnsystem → Kollisionswarner  	occasionally → gelegentlich → manchmal  	parking → Parken → Rangieren  	approaching → Näherungsgegenstände → herannahende Objekte  		**Explanation:**  	- "Kollisionswarnsystem" in HYP is a more specific technical term than "Kollisionswarner" in REF, potentially making it a more direct translation of "collision warning system," but it changes the level of specificity.	- "Gelegentlich" in HYP translates to "occasionally," while "manchmal" is more directly equivalent from SRC to REF.	- "Parken" corresponds closely to "parking," but "Rangieren" implies maneuvering, which aligns more accurately with REF.	- "Näherungsgegenstände" is not an accurate translation of "approaching objects," whereas "herannahende Objekte" aligns contextually with both the source and REF.
high-beam → hochrangige → Fernlicht  	assistant → Assistentensystem → Assistent
intelligent → intelligenten → intelligente  	speed regulator → Geschwindigkeitskontrollbehörden → Temporegler  	traffic signage → Verkehrssignale → Verkehrszeichenerkennung  	reduces → verringern → drosselt  	if necessary → erforderlichenfalls → bei Bedarf  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Intelligenten" in HYP is plural, whereas "intelligent" in SRC and REF refers to a singular item.  	2. "Geschwindigkeitskontrollbehörden" in HYP is a mistranslation of "speed regulator"/"Temporegler".  	3. "Verkehrssignale" in HYP indicates a general traffic signal, differing from "traffic signage"/"Verkehrszeichenerkennung", which is more specific to signs.  	4. "Verringern" (to decrease) in HYP and "drosselt" (to reduce, throttle) in REF have different implications in the context of controlling speed.  	5. "Erforderlichenfalls" in HYP translates to "if necessary" but does not capture the concise conditional necessity as "bei Bedarf" in REF.
full → Verknüpfung → volle  	connectivity → Verknüpfung → Konnektivität  	top-of-the-range → nach oben → Top-Ausstattung  	inch → inteck → Zoll
USB ports → USB-Häfen → USB-Buchse  	HDMI port → HDMI-Hafen → HDMI-Buchse  	armrest → Dach → Armlehne
costs → Die → [not explicitly stated in REF: translate with verb form]  	euros → Euro → [plural form alignment; considered stylistic, reported for precision]  	top-of-the-range → gut ausgestatteten Top-Diesel → [conceptual mismatch]  	fair → in Ordnung → [conceptual translation discrepancy—"in Ordnung" indicates acceptability, whereas "fair" might imply justice]		**Explanation:** 		1. "Die" in REF is a determiner relating to cost, implicitly presenting a different structure than the HYP verb form "kostet"; however, it wouldn't necessarily change meaning, hence reported for structural clarity beyond "errors."	2. The translation "Euro" in singular as opposed to "euros" in plural is a typical place of syntactic concord in translations but is noted here for precision.	3. "hochmodernes" doesn't address "gut ausgestatteten" or "top-of-the-range" entirely, indicating some semantic overlap but distinct marketing implications.	4. "fair" varies in value schema from "in Ordnung"—where the latter might not imply comparable pricing—in dialogue, presenting a subjective deviation removed from objective audit metrics.		Formik executing consistency rather than error synopses for fluency assurance—flagging involves both conceptual and pragmatic translation practice.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:**  	The terms "Euro-6-Emissionsnormen" in HYP and "Euro-6-Abgasnorm" in REF both adequately translate "euro 6 emissions standards" from the SRC, with only minor differences in wording that do not affect the meaning. There are no significant errors in the translation.
HR-V → Lkw → HR-V  	diverse → diversifiziertes → vielseitiges  	car → Fahrzeug → Auto  
Airline → Fluggesellschaft → Airline  	Fall → Fahren → Sturz  	boarding → Bordbrücke → Fluggastbrücke  		**Explanation:**  	- "Fluggesellschaft" is not a mistranslation but a correct translation of "Airline" with a more specific focus on word choice preference. However, it is contextually significant when "Airline" retains technical implications in legal contexts.  	- "Fahren" significantly changes the event from "Fall/Sturz," which is crucial in understanding the nature of liability.  	- "boarding bridge" translated as "Passagier-Bordbrücke" is incorrect compared to "Fluggastbrücke" which is the standard term.
liable → Fall → haftet  	fall → Fall → Sturz  	boarding bridge → Bordbrücke → Fluggastbrücke  
liability → Haftung → Haftung  	aviation travel → Flugverkehr → Luftverkehr  	Higher Regional Court → Oberste Regionalgerichtshof → Oberlandesgericht  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Haftung" is correctly translated from "liability."  	2. "Flugverkehr" and "Luftverkehr" are synonymous in this context for "aviation travel," but "Flugverkehr" is not a direct mistranslation.  	3. "Oberste Regionalgerichtshof" mistranslates "Higher Regional Court," which should be "Oberlandesgericht" as in the REF.  		Focusing on the single-word translation errors that significantly alter meaning, the last point is crucial.
claimant → Kläger → Kläger  	broken → durchgemacht → gebrochen  	kneecap → Knackenfall → Kniescheibe  		**Explanation:** There's a translation error in "durchgemacht" which is incorrectly used for "broken". The word "Knackenfall" in HYP is not a correct translation for "kneecap", altering the meaning significantly.
court → Gericht → Gericht  		**Explanation:** The word "court" in the source and both "Gericht" in HYP and REF correctly translate it. Therefore, there are no single-word translation errors in this example. Since no errors are detected in any other words as well, the final output should be:		No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "Entschädigung" in HYP and "Schadenersatz" in REF are valid translations for "compensation" in the context of the sentence. The meaning of the sentence remains consistent across translations.
illness → Krankheiten → Krankheitsfall  	organisers → Organisatoren → Veranstalter
Reisende → Urlauber → Urlauber
Besucher → Gäste → Besucher		**Explanation:** "Besucher" in HYP is a mistranslation of "visitors"/"Gäste" from SRC/REF, which changes the contextual expectation slightly even though both indicate individuals attending an event or place. This subtlety of meaning between 'visitors' and 'guests' where "Gäste" intends a more formal or invited presence could be considered significant in certain contexts.
diarrhoea → Diarrhoea → Durchfall  	vomiting → moving → Erbrechen  		**Explanation:** "Diarrhoea" in HYP retains the English spelling and is a mistranslation; it should be translated as "Durchfall" as seen in REF. "Bewegte" (moving) incorrectly translates "vomiting" from SRC, which should be translated as "Erbrechen" in REF.
room → Saal → Zimmer
seawater → Wasser → Meerwasser
opinion → Meinung → Ansicht  	holiday → Urlaub → Reise  	organiser → Organisator → Veranstalter  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Meinung" in HYP does not align with "Ansicht" in REF, both translating the word "opinion". Though similar, "Ansicht" fits the context better.	2. "Urlaub" in HYP translates "holiday," whereas "Reise" in REF is used, which is a more suitable term in this context.	3. "Organisator" in HYP and "Veranstalter" in REF both translate "organiser," but "Veranstalter" is more contextually appropriate in this legal context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** There are no single-word translation errors in the HYP sentence compared to SRC and REF. The word choices, such as "Kläger" for "claimants," "Gericht" for "court," and "kein Glück" for "no luck," adequately convey the intended meaning, despite minor variations in phrasing.
waste treatment plant → Abfallbehandlungsanlage → Kläranlage  	suffering → leidet → defekt  		**Explanation:** "Abfallbehandlungsanlage" in HYP is a mistranslation compared to "Kläranlage" in REF for "waste treatment plant." Similarly, "leidet" is incorrectly translated from "suffering" in SRC to "defekt" in REF, indicating a failure or defect which fits the context better.
Organisator → Veranstalter → Veranstalter  	Abgang → Abreise → Abreise  	Antragsteller → Kläger → Kläger  		**Explanation:** "Organisator" and "Veranstalter," "Abgang" and "Abreise," "Antragsteller" and "Kläger" are mismatches between HYP and REF that alter the contextual meaning.
seawater → Wasser → Meerwasser
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation (HYP) effectively conveys the same meaning as the source sentence (SRC) and is consistent with the reference translation (REF) in terms of meaning, using slightly different but contextually appropriate words or constructions.
No translation errors detected.
Menschen → viele → Menschen  	Anschbach → Anschläge → Ansbach  		**Explanation:**  	1. "viele" in HYP is a mistranslation in context compared to "Menschen" in both SRC and REF, as it omits the component "people".	2. "Anschbach" in HYP is a typographical error for "Ansbach", changing the specific location referenced.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Sieg" in HYP and "Triumph" in REF accurately translate "victory" from SRC, showing a minor synonym variation without a meaningful change in context or meaning. Similarly, "geben" in HYP and "gönnen" in REF both convey the notion of giving/not allowing, with only a minor divergence that does not significantly impact meaning compared to the source sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately reflects the meaning of the SRC sentence when compared with the REF sentence. The words used are suitable translations, and no significant meaning errors are identified.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both HYP and REF correctly convey the meaning of the SRC sentence. While there are variations in wording, no individual word in HYP mistranslates the meaning conveyed by SRC compared to REF.
mid-four figure → Mittelvierzahl → vierstelliger
Advertising → Werbung → Sympathiewerbung
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence and aligns well with the REF translation, with no single-word mistranslations altering the intended message.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence adequately translates the key elements and meaning of the SRC sentence, such as "doctors' confidentiality obligations" and "remain, according to De Maizière," maintaining contextual accuracy in comparison to the REF sentence. Differences, such as "Vertraulichkeitsverpflichtungen" versus "Schweigepflicht," are minor and reflect acceptable synonyms or stylistic choices without significantly altering the meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence effectively conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence. The differences with the REF sentence are minor variations in wording and structure but do not constitute clear mistranslations of single words from SRC.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation (HYP) preserves the overall meaning and context of the source sentence ("The Minister felt that improved social care was important to counteract the radicalisation of refugees.") and aligns well with the reference translation (REF). There are no single-word mistranslations that significantly alter the meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence provides an accurate translation that captures the essential meaning and context of the SRC sentence. The variations between HYP and REF such as "Lehrer" vs "Lehrkräfte" or "ausgebildet" vs "vorbereitet" are minor discrepancies and do not constitute clear translation errors as they do not significantly change the meaning.

No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
slap → Schlag → Ohrfeige  	agitators → Agitatoren → Scharfmacher  		**Explanation:** "Schlag" in HYP is a mistranslation for "slap"/"Ohrfeige" from SRC/REF, as "Schlag" could mean "hit" in general, while "Ohrfeige" specifically captures a figurative and literal "slap." "Agitatoren" in HYP is a different interpretation of "agitators" than "Scharfmacher," with "Scharfmacher" being a more precise fit in the political context mentioned in the REF.
coalition → Koalition → Union  	nationality → Nationalität → Staatsangehörigkeit  		**Explanation:**  	- "Koalition" in HYP mistranslates "coalition" from SRC in the context where "Union" is used in REF, reflecting the specific group in question.	- "Nationalität" in HYP is a mistranslation of "nationality" when compared with "Staatsangehörigkeit" from REF, though both can mean nationality in English, "Staatsangehörigkeit" is more contextually appropriate here.
No translation errors detected.
opposed → gegen → lehne ab  		**Explanation:** "Gegen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "opposed to"/"lehne ab" from SRC/REF, altering the expression of opposition.
- law → Regeln → Gesetz
Head → Chef → Chefin  	accused → beschuldigte → warf vor  	Minister → Ministerin → Minister  	create → erzeugen → simulieren  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Head" in SRC corresponds to "Chefin" in REF, not "Chef".  	2. "Accused" in SRC should be "warf vor" (charged or accused) as in REF, not simply "beschuldigte".  	3. "Minister" in SRC refers to a male minister, which should correspond to "Minister" as in REF, not "Ministerin" (female minister).  	4. "Create" in SRC is aligned with an intention to "simulate" as in REF, not just "erzeugen" (to generate or create).
Head → Linksleiter → Linken-Parteichef  	smooth talking → reibungsloses Gespräch → Flotte Sprüche  
flow → Verkehrsströme → Verkehrsfluss  	motorway slip road → Straße → Autobahnzubringer  
Traffic jams → Verkehrsstaus → staut sich  	photo → Foto → Bild  	bypass → Umgehung → Umgehungsstraße  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Verkehrsstaus" does not adequately reflect "staut sich", which conveys the action of traffic building up.	2. "Foto" is a less fitting translation for "Bild" in this context, where "Bild" is preferred.	3. "Umgehung" doesn't fully capture the meaning of "Umgehungsstraße", which specifies a bypass road.
right-hand turning lane → Kehrtwende der Rechten → Rechtsabbiegespur
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation effectively conveys the same meaning as the SRC and matches sufficiently with the REF in terms of content and context. Any discrepancies are minor and do not significantly alter the meaning.
Roadwork-Büro → Landesbetrieb Straßenbau → Landesbetrieb Straßenbau  	rechte Hand → Rechtsabbiegerspur → Rechtsabbiegerspur  	Auszug → Abfahrt → Abfahrt
drivers → Fahrer → Autofahrer  	feed → eintreten → einfädeln  	Futtermittel → einsteigen → None (not present in REF)		**Explanation:**  	1. "Fahrer" ("drivers") in HYP misses the contextual nuance captured by "Autofahrer" (car drivers) in REF.	2. "einsteigen" ("feed") in HYP is a mistranslation for the context of merging or threading into traffic, as correctly given by "einfädeln" in REF.	3. "Futtermittel" is an erroneous addition in HYP, directly mistranslating "feed" and altering the context completely as it's not present in SRC or REF.
traffic → Verkehr → Verkehr  	busy → Verbreitung → vielbefahrenen		**Explanation:**  		- "Verkehr" in both HYP and REF translates "traffic" from SRC correctly, so it remains unchanged as shown for verification.	- "Verbreitung" in HYP is incorrect as it suggests "distribution" rather than a busy road. Correct would be "vielbefahrenen" as in REF, meaning "busy" or "heavily trafficked."	
CDU fraction → CDU-Bruchteil → CDU-Fraktion  	lengthen the exit → Verlängerung des Ausstiegs → verlängerten Ausfahrt
traffic → Strecke → Fahrbahnverengung  	slip road → Strecke → Zubringer
traffic jam → Verkehrsstaus → Rückstau  	over → über ihn → darüber hinaus  		**Explanation:**  	- "Verkehrsstaus" in HYP is a mistranslation of "traffic jam"/"Rückstau" from SRC/REF, affecting the meaning.	- "über ihn" in HYP incorrectly translates "over"/"darüber hinaus", changing the context from going beyond.
bottleneck → Engpass → Nadelöhr  	exit → Ausstieg → Abfahrt  	Weseler → Wessel → Weseler  
traffic → Verkehrsstrecke → Verkehr  		**Explanation:** "Verkehrsstrecke" in HYP is a mistranslation of "traffic"/"Verkehr" from SRC/REF, as it suggests a traffic route or path rather than the flow or presence of traffic itself.
eighteen → eindreiviertel → eighteen months  		**Explanation:** "eindreiviertel Jahren" in REF indicates a period of "one and three-quarter years," which accurately reflects the SRC meaning of "eighteen months," but the HYP "achtzehn Monaten" matches SRC accurately. Indicating potential differences in understanding but HYP aligns correctly numerically with SRC's "eighteen months."
reason → Grund dafür → Grund  	structural analysis → strukturelle Analyse → Statische Berechnungen  	shown → gezeigt hat → ergeben  	bridge → Brücke → Brücke (Not an error, included for contextual reference)  	two lanes → zwei Strecken → zweispurig  	supporting → unterstützen → aufnehmen (interpreted differently but contextually accurate)  	weight → Gewicht → Tragkraft (interpreted as supporting ability rather than literal weight)  	heavy goods vehicles → Schwerlastfahrzeugen → Schwerlastverkehr  		**Note:**  	- The word "Strecken" mismatched "lanes" and should rather fit contextually to the concept of dual carriageways; "zweispurig" fits better.  	- "Tragkraft" related to the effective carrying capacity, diverging from the literal "weight" in the context of infrastructure load, affecting meaning.  	- "aufnehmen" nuances into "supporting", aligning with infrastructure capacity nuances better.
authorities → Behörden → Landesbetrieb  	rush-hour → Nahrstundenverkehr → werktägliche  		**Explanation:** "Behörden" in HYP is a mistranslation of "authorities"/"Landesbetrieb" from SRC/REF, as the context specifies a particular state entity. "Nahrstundenverkehr" is not a correct translation for "rush-hour"/"werktägliche" from SRC/REF, where "Stau" more accurately captures traffic within the daily commute context.
No translation errors detected.
authorities → Behörden → Landesbetrieb  	period → Zeit → Zeit  	right-hand → rechten Hand → Rechtsabbiege  	cause → verursachen → mit rechnen  		**Explanation:** 	- "Bezirksbehörden" in HYP mistranslates "authorities" as "Bezirksbehörden" instead of "Landesbetrieb".	- "right-hand" is mistranslated to "rechten Hand" instead of "Rechtsabbiegespur" in REF.	- "cause" translated as "verursachen" does not match the meaning of "mit rechnen" (expect or anticipate) used in REF. While "verursachen" could fit a similar meaning, it significantly alters the expected context.	- Additionally, "Zeit" in HYP correctly reflects the meaning of "period", although the exact phrasing differs slightly between HYP and REF, the meaning is consistent here overall.
1. past → über → vorbei  	2. single → einzigen → einspurig  	3. lane → Strecke → Spur 
journey → Weg → Reise
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP maintains the meaning of the source sentence accurately within the context provided, and variations between HYP and REF do not constitute significant mistranslations.
Nima's → Nima → Nima's  	association → Vereinigung → Verein  	Young Theatre → "Junge Theater" → Junge Theater  	now → nun → jetzt  	musical → musikalisches → Musik
Verein → Vereinigung → Nima's  	Jugendlichen → Menschen → Jugendlichen  	Flüchtlingshintergrund → Migrationshintergrund → Flüchtlingshintergrund  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Verein" in REF translates to "association" in SRC, but HYP uses "Vereinigung," which does not match the specific translation given in REF.	2. "Jugendlichen" in REF is translated as "young people" in SRC, but HYP uses "Menschen," which could be seen as more generic and less specific than the intended context.	3. "Flüchtlingshintergrund" in REF is explicitly mentioned, whereas HYP omits this and only uses "Migrationshintergrund," missing part of the description provided in the SRC and REF.
International Class → Internationale Klasse → Klasse International  	saw → sah → hat besucht  	performance → Bilanz → Vorstellung  	award-winning → auszeichnenden → preisgekrönten  	Young Theatre → jungen Theater → Jungen Theaters  		**Explanation:**  	- "Internationale Klasse" should be "Klasse International" to match the REF.  	- "sah" translates to "saw" literally but doesn't fit the context properly where "hat besucht" (has attended) would be correct.  	- "Bilanz" (balance/summary) is a mistranslation for "performance" which should be "Vorstellung".  	- "auszeichnenden" should be "preisgekrönten" to accurately translate "award-winning".  	- "jungen Theater" misses the capitalization and does not account for the possessive form used in REF.
set up → eingerichteten → initiierten  	play → Spiel → Inszenierung  		**Explanation:**  	- "eingerichteten" (set up) does not fit as well as "initiierten" as it suggests more of setting up a physical structure rather than initiating a project like "Intercultural Journey".  	- "Spiel" (play) in HYP does not convey the theatrical context as well as "Inszenierung" from REF, which is more aligned with the concept of viewing a theatrical production.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence and is contextually consistent with the REF translation. While there are minor structural differences between HYP and REF, the single-word translations and overall meaning are not significantly altered.
young people → jungen Menschen → Jugendlichen
plot → Komplott → Handlungsverlauf  	scenic images → Szenen → szenischen Bilder
No translation errors detected.
Migrant → Migrationshintergrund → Flucht- und Migrationshintergrund  	acting → handeln → Schauspiel
plans → Pläne → Planung  	acting → Handeln → Theaterspiel  	language training → Sprachausbildung → Sprachvermittlung  		**Explanation:**  	- "Pläne" in HYP mismatches with "planning"/"Planung" from SRC/REF, suggesting a subtle but contextually significant error in translation.  	- "Handeln" in HYP incorrectly translates "acting" from SRC, while "Theaterspiel" in REF more accurately conveys the intended meaning.  	- "Sprachausbildung" in HYP does not fully capture "language training" as "Sprachvermittlung" in REF, which suggests a more focused and appropriate term in this theatrical context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence in German. Both "Interkulturelle Reise" (HYP) and "Interkulturellen Reise" (REF) appropriately translate the name of the project. The rest of the sentence is also correctly translated, albeit with slight variations that don't significantly alter meaning.
Verein → Organisation → Verein		**Explanation:** "Organisation" in HYP is a mistranslation of "association"/"Verein" from SRC/REF, altering the specific entity mentioned in the sentence.
stars → Sterne → Sternschnuppen
Hoping → hoffen → - (Hoping is contextually better captured by "Guckern" in REF as "Sternschnuppen-Guckern" implies the act of hoping or expecting to observe.)  	shooting stars → Schießstars → Sternschnuppen  
clouds and rain overnight → Wolken und Regen von heute auf morgen → Wolken und Regen nachts  	celestial show → zentrale Schauveranstaltung → Himmelsspektakel  		**Explanation:**  	1. "von heute auf morgen" in HYP mistranslates "overnight" from SRC, while the REF uses "nachts," reflecting the intended time correctly.	2. "zentrale Schauveranstaltung" in HYP incorrectly conveys "celestial show" from SRC, whereas "Himmelsspektakel" in REF correctly maintains the astronomical context.
We → Unsere → Unsere  	are pinning → liegt → setzen  	on → auf → am  	Friday → Freitag → Samstag  
shooting stars → Sterne → Sternschnuppen
shooting stars → Schießstars → Sternschnuppen
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation accurately reflects the meaning of the SRC sentence when compared to the REF. The differences between HYP and REF are minor synonym variations and do not indicate significant mistranslations.
Silent → Schweigen → Erholsame  	Tips → Tips → Tipps (stylistic difference, not a translation error)
1. evening → Abend → Abends  	2. whirring → jammern → wälzt  	3. you → man → man (contextually, not an error as it's a consistent translation in both HYP and REF)  	4. in the → im → abends  	5. your → man → man (not an error, consistent with German structures)  	6. morning → Vormittag → morgens  		**Explanation:** "Abend" in HYP does not match the time context provided by "Abends" in REF. "Jammern" does not correctly convey "whirring" as "wälzt" does, which better fits the context of restlessness. "Vormittag" implies "forenoon," which doesn't match "morning," as used in the context before the alarm goes off, where "morgens" aligns better.
relaxing → nachgiebig → erholsam
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence and aligns well with the REF translation, with no single-word errors that significantly change the context or meaning.
manifest → zutage → äußern  
President → Vorsitzenden → Vorstandsmitglied  	emphasises → Betonung liegt auf → betont  		**Explanation:**  	- "Vorsitzenden" in HYP is a mistranslation of "President"/"Vorstandsmitglied" from SRC/REF, suggesting a specific leadership role that doesn't align with SRC/REF.	- "Betonung liegt auf" in HYP incorrectly translates the verb "emphasises"/"betont" in SRC/REF, changing the intended meaning.
insomnia → Unmenschlichkeit → Insomnie
1. throughout the night → in der ganzen Nacht → Durchschlafen  	2. Varel → Varela → Varel  		**Explanation:**  	- "in der ganzen Nacht" in HYP is a mistranslation of "throughout the night"/"Durchschlafen" from SRC/REF, altering the context by making it sound like full nights rather than continuous sleep.	- "Varela" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Varel" from SRC/REF, which is simply a typographical error affecting the meaning by indicating the wrong geographic location.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The translation of each word in the HYP sentence is contextually correct compared to both the SRC and the REF. The difference between "für" in HYP and "von" in REF is a minor prepositional variation that does not significantly affect the meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence accurately captures the meaning of the SRC sentence and aligns well with the REF translation despite some variation in word choice.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Despite the different word choices between HYP and REF, both accurately convey the meaning of applying a "reflection" in SRC, interpreted as "Ausdruck" (expression) in the context, and handle the source sentence meaning correctly.
Waking → Erwachen → Aufwachen  	very early → [missing in HYP] → sehr frühes  	common → verbunden → häufig
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence translates the SRC sentence in a way that captures the intended meaning. Any differences between HYP and REF, such as "gegenseitig beeinflussen" in HYP compared to "einander bedingen" in REF, are minor and do not significantly alter the overall message or context of the SRC.
slipped disk → Lapsus → Bandscheibenvorfall  	lie down → niederzuschlagen → liegen  	suggests → suggeriert → gibt  	Weeß → Schweß → Weeß  		**Explanation:**  	- "Lapsus" in HYP is a mistranslation of "slipped disk"/"Bandscheibenvorfall" from SRC/REF, changing the medical context.	- "Niederzuschlagen" in HYP is incorrectly translated for "lie down"/"liegen", altering the intended action.	- "Suggeriert" in HYP doesn't match "suggests"/"gibt", misrepresenting the speaker's intention.	- "Schweß" in HYP is a wrong translation of the name, which is "Weeß" in both SRC and REF.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation adequately conveys the meaning of the SRC sentence compared to the REF. While there is a difference in the wording ("Spannungen" vs. "Anspannung" and "nicht schlafen" vs. "Schlaf ist nicht mehr möglich"), these differences represent acceptable variations without significant meaning changes.
When → Wann → Ab wann  	see → sehen → zum Arzt  		**Explanation:** "Wann" in HYP does not capture the nuance of "When" compared to "Ab wann" in REF which aligns better with SRC's context. Additionally, "sehen" does not appropriately match the idea of "seeing a doctor" as expressed in "zum Arzt" in the REF.
sleep → schlaft → schläft  	see → sehen → gehen  	advises → den Ratgeber → rät
1. rested → ruhig → unausgeschlafen	2. alert → Warnschwierigkeiten → Aufmerksamkeit	3. irritable → irritabel → leicht reizbar	4. mood swings → Stimmgewebe → Stimmungsschwankungen
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence covers the primary elements of the SRC sentence adequately, and the translation in HYP aligns with REF, maintaining the overall meaning and context. Any differences are minor refinements or variations in phrasing typical in translation and do not constitute clear mistranslations.
Prof. → Professor → Prof.  	Fietze → Fix → Fietze  	Zentrum → Zentrum → Zentrums  	schlafende Arzneimittel → Schlafmedizinischen → Schlafmediziner  	im → der → der  	Arzneimittelzentrum → Universitätsmedizin → Universitätsmedizin  		**Explanation:**  	- "Prof." in SRC/REF is mistranslated as "Professor" in HYP. While technically similar, if "Prof." is used as a title, it should remain consistent.	- "Fietze" is incorrectly translated as "Fix" in HYP instead of preserving the original name.	- "Zentrum" should agree in its correct form and possessive case as in REF ("Zentrums").	- "schlafende Arzneimittel" is an incorrect translation. The phrase contextually refers to "sleep medicine/Schlafmedizinischen" or similar professional context (not "sleeping drugs").	- "im" (meaning "in the") is a mistranslation for the context where the possessive form "der" is needed.	- "Arzneimittelzentrum" does not make sense in the context, where REF uses "Universitätsmedizin" which refers to the academic institution correctly.
GP → BIP → Hausarzt  	Weeß → Weß → Weeß  		**Explanation:**  	- "BIP" in HYP is a mistranslation of "GP"/"Hausarzt" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning in context.  	- "Weß" in HYP is a mistranscription of "Weeß," a proper noun, affecting accuracy.
your → Ihr → Der  	examine → prüfen → abklären  	physical → physische → körperliche  
schlaflab → Schlaflabor → Schlaflabor  	geschieht → passiert → passiert  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Schlaflab" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Schlaflabor" from both SRC and REF.	2. "Geschieht" in HYP is used instead of "passiert" as in REF. While they both mean "happens," in this context "passiert" better matches the nuance and usage of the original question.
Verleumdung → Verleumdung → Schnarchen  	Schlafzetteln → Schlafzetteln → Schlaflabor  	Fix → Fix → Fietze  		**Explanation:**		1. "Verleumdung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "snoring"/"Schnarchen" from SRC/REF.	2. "Schlafzetteln" in HYP is a mistranslation of "sleep lab"/"Schlaflabor" from SRC/REF.	3. "Fix" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Fietze" from SRC/REF, changing the name incorrectly.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Despite different wording and structure, the candidate translation (HYP) uses "Prüfung" while the reference translation (REF) uses "Untersuchung" for "examination," both of which are acceptable in the given context. The overall meaning is preserved across translations.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence maintains the intended meaning from the SRC, and although phrasing is slightly different from the REF, it adequately conveys the same message. The discrepancies are minor and do not constitute single-word translation errors.
afternoon nap → Nachmittagsnap → Mittagsschlaf  	Fietze → Fix → Fietze
cabled → Kabeljagd → Verkabeln  		**Explanation:** "Kabeljagd" in HYP is a mistranslation of "cabled"/"Verkabeln" from SRC/REF, which changes the meaning in context.
electrodes → im → am  	Nasalkonsula → Nasalkonsula → Nasenbrille  	Kaste → Kaste → Brust  	Fühler → Fühler → Sensor  		**Explanation:**  	- "im" in HYP is a mistranslation of "am," altering the preposition contextually.	- "Nasalkonsula" is not a valid translation and differs from "Nasenbrille."	- "Kaste" in HYP does not match "Brust" in REF.	- "Fühler" in the REF should be replaced with "Sensor" in the HYP, although both terms can be contextually correct.
1. ceiling → Obergrenzen → Decke  	2. records → angehäuft → auf  	3. sleeper → Schlafer → Schlafenden  
affected → Betroffenen → Betroffene  	get a grip on → aufnehmen → in den Griff kriegen
fair few → einige → ziemlich viele  	areas → Bereiche → Stellschrauben  	night's sleep → Schlaf der Nacht → Schlaf  		**Explanation:** "einige" (HYP) is less specific than "ziemlich viele" (REF) translating "fair few" from SRC, "Bereiche" (HYP) does not capture the specificity of "Stellschrauben" (REF), and "Schlaf der Nacht" (HYP) is a less natural construction compared to "Schlaf" in context.
going → gehen → Schlafens  	getting → ansteigen → Aufsteh  	staying → stehen → liegen  	watching → schlafen → fernsehen  	looking → sehen → schauen  	clock → Uhr → Uhr  		**Explanation:**  	1. "going" should translate to "Schlafens" instead of "gehen" as it implies "bedtime" in this context.  	2. "getting" should translate to "Aufsteh" instead of "ansteigen" as it implies "getting up time".  	3. "staying" should be "liegen" instead of "stehen" to not change the context of "remaining in bed".  	4. "watching" should be "fernsehen" instead of "schlafen" as the context implies watching television.  	5. "looking" should be "schauen" instead of "sehen" to fit better with "looking at the clock".  	6. "clock" translates correctly to "Uhr" in both HYP and REF, indicating I initially made a mistake there. Let's strike it out.
jung → Dschungellager → Dschungelcamp  	missing → vermissten → fehlenden  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "berichtete" in HYP and "geäußert" in REF translate the meaning of "posted ... about" in SRC well, and other words align closely across translations with no significant changes in meaning.
Short-Curse-Swimming-Champions → Kurzbahnweltmeisterschaften → Kurzbahnweltmeisterschaften  	Weltbilanz → Weltrekord → Weltrekord
Athlete → Athlete → Athlet  	Facebook → Facebook → via Facebook  	Teamate → Teamate → Ex-Teamkollegen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Athlete" from SRC is incorrectly translated as "Athlete" in HYP instead of "Athlet" as in REF.	- "On Facebook" from SRC should be "via Facebook" as in REF, but HYP uses the incorrect phrasing "in Facebook".	- "Teammates" from SRC is translated incorrectly as "Teamate" (misspelled and incorrect) in HYP, REF correctly uses "Ex-Teamkollegen".
Olympic champion → Olympischer Fürsprecher → Olympiasieger  	King of the Jungle → König des Dschungels → Dschungelkönig  	Thursday night → Donnerstagabend → in der Nacht zu Freitag  	Facebook page → Facebook → Facebook-Seite  		**Explanation:** "Olympischer Fürsprecher" translates to "Olympic advocate" rather than "Olympic champion" (Olympiasieger), "König des Dschungels" translates more literally to "King of the Jungle" instead of the contextual "Dschungelkönig," "Donnerstagabend" is "Thursday evening" whereas the REF specifies it happened "in der Nacht zu Freitag" ("Friday night"), and "Facebook" lacks the additional context of "page" in "Facebook-Seite."
remuneration → Entschädigung → Förderung  	swimming → Schwimmen → Schwimmsport  	tests → Dopingtests → Dopingkontrollen  
pay a lot → dem Doping viel Aufmerksamkeit schenken → sehr viel fördern  	don't pay as much attention → dem Doping viel Aufmerksamkeit schenken → nicht so genau hinsehen  		**Explanation:** In the HYP sentence, "dem Doping viel Aufmerksamkeit schenken" (paying much attention to doping) is used instead of "pay a lot" or "very much encourage", which changes the meaning significantly compared to both the SRC and REF. Additionally, the phrase "dem Doping viel Aufmerksamkeit schenken" does not truly capture the meaning of "don't pay as much attention" either, as seen in REF's "nicht so genau hinsehen".
No translation errors detected.
make → Gründung → starten (or) started → Gründung → Start  		**Explanation:** "Gründung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "make/start" from SRC/REF. It implies "establishment" rather than the intended action related to a "comeback/start."
No translation errors detected.
Weltmeisterschaften → WM → ("Weltmeisterschaften" is a correct direct translation, but "WM" is the specific acronym used in the REF and fits the context better.)	Olympischen Spielen → OS → ("Olympischen Spielen" is a correct direct translation, but "OS" is the specific acronym used in the REF and fits the context better.)	resident → Bewohner → Wahl-Hamburger		**Explanation:**  	- "Weltmeisterschaften" and "Olympischen Spielen" translate directly from SRC to HYP as "World Championships" and "Olympics," but REF uses acronyms "WM" (World Championships) and "OS" (Olympics), which are contextually more appropriate in German.	- "resident" is translated as "Bewohner" in HYP, whereas REF uses "Wahl-Hamburger," which conveys a more precise cultural and contextual meaning aligning with the person's association with Hamburg.
Gang → Gruppe → Bande  	thieves → Gepäckdiebstählen → Gepäckdieben  		**Explanation:** "Gruppe" is a mistranslation of "gang"/"Bande", and "Gepäckdiebstählen" is a mistranslation of "thieves"/"Gepäckdieben", both altering the intended meaning.
Berufliche → Professionelle → Professionelle  	Dusseldorf → Düsseldorf → Düsseldorf  		**Explanation:** "Berufliche" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Professional"/"Professionelle" from SRC/REF, and "Dusseldorf" should include the umlaut as "Düsseldorf" as in the REF.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP captures the meaning from the SRC and aligns well with the REF, translating the key elements accurately without altering the meaning significantly. The differences in wording, such as the use of "Zivilfahndern" (plain clothes officers/detectives) and "Polizeibeamten" (police officers) do not change the overall meaning.
Verdächtigen → Tatverdächtigen → Tatverdächtigen  	Gepäckstücke → Taschen → Taschen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Verdächtigen" in HYP is a general term for "suspects," while "Tatverdächtigen" in REF is a more precise term meaning "suspects involved in a crime," which aligns with the context.	2. "Gepäckstücke" in HYP, translated as "items of luggage," is incorrect when "Taschen" in REF more accurately matches "bags" from the SRC.
civil → Beamte → zivile  	Airport → Flughafen → Bereich des Flughafens  	police → Polizei → Polizisten  
1. men → Männer → Männer  	2. offences → Straftaten → Delikte  		**Explanation:** The word "Männer" correctly translates "men" in both HYP and REF, so there is no error in this word. However, "Straftaten" in HYP and "Delikte" in REF both translate "offences" from SRC, which can be stylistically different but do not significantly change the meaning. Therefore, no single-word mistranslation errors are detected.  		**Revised Output:**  	No translation errors detected.
1. specialists → Fachleute → Spezialisten	2. police inspectorate → Polizeiinspektion → Kriminalkommissariat	3. prove → nachweisen → nachweisen (Note: The tense used in HYP vs. REF "konnten" vs. "können" shifts the context but does not alter the core meaning of "proof.")	4. thieves → Diebe → Dieben	5. crimes → Verbrechen → Straftaten (Note: "Taten" as the correct REF implies a broader range but is contextually similar.)	6. committed crimes → Verbrechen begangen → Taten nachweisen (Note: There is a contextual difference regarding the implication of commitment vs. proving the act in the REF.)		**Explanation:** The differences highlighted above show significant variations in word choice and context between HYP and REF, pertained to specific roles, entities, and actions.
No translation errors detected.

east → Ost → Osten  	painted → gezeichnete → gestrichenen  	health-food → Lebensmittelladen → Bioladen  
has spraypainted → gepriesen → gesprüht
Lidl → einer → einem  	rend → Rentenabteilungen → Mietwohnungen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Lidl": The HYP uses "einer" (feminine) while both SRC and REF imply "Lidl" should be treated as "einem" (neutral or masculine in German context).	2. "rend": The HYP incorrectly translates "to rend" as "Rentenabteilungen", which means "pension departments", whereas the correct term in the REF is "Mietwohnungen" meaning "apartments to rent".
trendy → Trendbezirk → trendigen  	illustrated → veranschaulicht → bebildert
squatters → Quattern → besetzt (Squatters)  	rental → Mietenverträge → Mietverträge  	ground → Boden → Erdgeschoss  
Henkel → [no translation] → Henkel  	autonomous → selbständige → autonomer  		**Explanation:**  	1. The name "Henkel" is mentioned in the SRC and REF sentences but is missing in the HYP sentence. Lacking this name changes the specific context of the statement.	2. The term "autonomous" from SRC is translated as "selbständige" in HYP, which inaccurately renders the correct meaning of "autonomer" found in REF. This significantly alters the intended description.
Kadterschmiede → Kadtermiede → Kadterschmiede  	boden → Boden → Erdgeschoss  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Kadterschmiede" is incorrectly translated as "Kadtermiede."  	2. "Erdgeschoss" (meaning "ground floor") is translated as "Boden," which usually means "ground" or "floor" but not in the context of a building's level.
unidentified → unbekannten → unbekannten  	rooms → Zimmer → Räume  	on behalf of → im Namen → im Auftrag  		**Explanation:**  	1. "unbekannten" is correct in REF for "unidentified," so no error here.	2. "Zimmer" and "Räume" both correspond to "rooms," so this is a minor synonym variation.	3. "im Namen" versus "im Auftrag" indicates a meaningful difference in context. "Im Auftrag" better reflects "on behalf of," while "im Namen" might be understood as "in the name of," which is contextually less accurate.		Therefore, the error lies with the phrase, not single words, making the translation overall contextually acceptable.  		No translation errors detected.
ruled → entschieden → entschied  	one day → eines Tages → einen Tag  	site → das Feld → Ort  	supporters → Helfershelfern → Sympathisanten  		**Explanation:** 	- "Ruled": The HYP uses "entschieden" which is a form consistent with Subjunctive I mood (often used for reported speech in German), while the noun form “entschied” in the REF is in simple past tense, matching past tense from the SRC.	- "One day": The HYP incorrects translates "one day" as "eines Tages," which implies uncertainty or a period of time, rather than "einen Tag später" which indicates exactly one day later in relation.	- "Site": The term "Feld" refers to "field," while "Ort" in the REF is more accurate for "site."	- "Supporters": The HYP incorrectly translates "supporters" as "Helfershelfern" (meaning 'henchmen' or 'accomplices'), which carries a negative connotation, whereas "Sympathisanten" is appropriate in this context.
street → Straße → Bürgersteig  	houses' → Häuser → Häusern  	steps → Schaltern → Bürgersteig  	off-licence → Freibrief → Späti  		**Explanation:**  	- "Schaltern" in HYP translates to "switches," while "steps" in the context of houses, should align with "Bürgersteig" from REF.	- "Freibrief" in HYP is not the correct translation for "off-licence," which aligns with "Späti" in the REF, referring to a type of convenience store.	- "Straßen" in HYP refers to "streets," but "steps" in this context should align with "Bürgersteig," meaning "sidewalk" from REF.	- "Häuser" in both HYP and REF translates as "houses," but the context requires understanding steps associated more closely with "Bürgersteig" as per REF.

Far-left → am stärksten bewohnten → linke  	worries → betroffen → Hauptsorge  	residents → Menschen → Anwohner  	irritated → verärgert → genervt
inhabitants → Bewohner → Bewohner  	fears → Angst → Sorge  	gentrification → Vergneidung → Gentrifizierung  		**Explanation:** In the HYP, "Bewohner" is the correct translation for "inhabitants". However, "Angst" in the HYP, while a plausible translation, doesn't encapsulate the nuance of "fears" as compared to "Sorge" in the REF. Additionally, "Vergneidung" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Gentrifizierung" from REF, affecting the meaning significantly.
Bezirk → Kiez → Kiez  		**Explanation:** "Bezirk" in HYP translates to "district" but does not capture the more specific meaning implied by "Kiez" in REF. "Kiez" better fits the urban and community context, as indicated in both SRC and REF.
schisms → Schlüsse → Graben  	squatters → Quattern → Hausbesetzern  
Friedrich → Friedrichshain → Friedrichshain  	Nachbarschaft → Arbeiterviertel → Arbeiterviertel  
Squatters → Wohnviertel → Hausbesetzungen  	spawn → anbauen → geboren  	squatters → Quattern → besetzt  	district → Bezirk → Kiez  	Mainzer Straßer → Mainzer Straßer → Mainzer Straße  	Rigauer → Rigauer → Rigaer  		**Explanation:**  	- The translation of "squatters" as "Wohnviertel" in HYP changes the meaning entirely from people (squatters) to areas (residential neighborhoods).	- "spawn" is translated as "anbauen," which suggests building or growing, rather than the more correct "geboren" (born or resulting).	- The repeated use of "squatters" is mistranslated as "Quattern," a non-existent or incorrect word, instead of the verb "besetzt" (occupied).	- "district" translated to "Bezirk" in HYP doesn't capture the neighborhood's informal implication as seen in "Kiez" in REF.	- "Mainzer Straßer" has a typographical error and does not match "Mainzer Straße."	- "Rigauer" is a typographical error for "Rigaer."
Mainzerstraße → Mainzer → Mainzer  	ausgerottet → geräumt → geräumt  	Rigauer → Rigaer → Rigaer  	gesessen → besetzt → besetzt  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Mainzerstraße" in HYP should just be "Mainzer" as in REF.	2. "ausgerottet" means "exterminated," while "geräumt" means "cleared" or "evacuated," which better fits the context of police action.	3. "Rigauer" is a mistranslation for "Rigaer," which matches the location context.	4. "gesessen" means "sat" while "besetzt" means "squatted," which fits the context of the activities described.
GDR → DDR → DDR  	squatters → Quästoren → Hausbesetzer  		**Explanation:** "Quästoren" in the HYP is a mistranslation of "squatters"/"Hausbesetzer" from SRC/REF. "Quästoren" refers to a different concept altogether. Additionally, both "Bezirk"/"Stadtteil" and "Magnet"/"Magneten" are acceptable translations, so these differences are not listed as errors.

No translation errors detected.
block → Block → Mietshaus	flats → Wohngebäuden → Mietshaus
acts → Gewaltakten → Gewalttaten  	number → Alter → 94  	certainly → mit Sicherheit → bestimmt  		**Explanation:**  	- "Gewaltakten" is a mistranslation of "acts of violence"/"Gewalttaten" from SRC/REF, as it changes the meaning slightly.	- "Alter" in HYP is a mistranslation of "number" for address purposes, which should be "in der"/"in der 94" just like in REF, not related to age.	- "Mit Sicherheit" in HYP translates to "certainly", but "bestimmt" in REF is more accurate for the context and intended meaning.
**Notorious → Berüchtigten → Berühmten**  		**Explanation:** "Berüchtigten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "notorious" from SRC, which should match "berühmten" in REF. This changes the level and type of notoriety associated with the cars.
1. flashpoint → Kriminalitätsflasch → krimineller Brennpunkt
No translation errors detected.
1. residents → Bürger → Anwohner	2. back → gingen → zurück	3. claiming → behaupteten → die Deutungshoheit beanspruchten	4. district → Bezirk → Stadtteil
residents → Einwohnern → Bewohnerinnen  	impersonal → unmenschliche → gesichtslose  	new developments → Entwicklungen → Neubauten  	old empty sites → alten leeren Standorten → ehemaligen Baulücken
freehold → freie → Eigentums  	flats → Wohnungen → Eigentumswohnungen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "freie" in the HYP is a mistranslation of "freehold"/"Eigentums" from the SRC/REF, changing the meaning.  	2. "Wohnungen" alone in HYP is a mistranslation of "flats" specifically as "Eigentumswohnungen" (freehold flats) in REF, making it incomplete and altering the context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP translation retains the meaning from the SRC sentence as well as aligns with the REF translation, despite some word order differences.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words in the HYP sentence adequately reflect the meaning from the SRC sentence, with no significant mistranslations compared to the REF.
Menschen → Zugezogene → people  	eingetroffen → zugezogen → moved in  	Wohnungsbauvorhaben → Hausprojekte → housing project  	Wahlkreises → Kiez → district  		**Explanation:** Each word in HYP significantly deviates from the SRC/REF meanings, thus changing the context. "Menschen" means "people" but fails to capture the specificity of "Zugezogene" (moved-in people), and similar errors occur with the other words.
1. move → begibt → zieht  	2. area → Gebiet → Viertel  		**Explanation:**  	- "begibt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "move"/"zieht" in SRC/REF, altering the nuance of the sentence.	- "Gebiet" in HYP is a less specific translation of "area" when compared to "Viertel" in REF, which captures the context of "an area full of pubs" more accurately.
No translation errors detected.
Deutscle → Deutschel → Deuschle  	Commissioner → Flüchtlingskommissar → Flüchtlingsbeauftragte
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence maintains the meaning of the SRC sentence. Although "Kontaktperson" differs from "Ansprechpartnerin" and "Organisation" differs from "Organisatorin," both are acceptable translations of their respective SRC words, indicating minor synonym variations that do not change the overall meaning.
No translation errors detected.
Deuschle → Duchele → Deuschle  	Commissioner → Flüchtlingskommissarin → Flüchtlingsbeauftragte  
The translation errors identified are:		education → Arbeiter → Pädagogin
point-of-contact → Kontaktstelle → Ansprechpartnerin  		**Explanation:** "Kontaktstelle" in HYP is a mistranslation of "point-of-contact" which should be "Ansprechpartnerin" in the context of the sentence, as indicated by the REF. This changes the intended meaning to a more impersonal one.
Regine → Reine → Regine  	working group → Arbeitsgruppe → Arbeitskreis  	volunteers → Freiwilligen → Ehrenamtlichen  	jack-of-all-trades → Jackwerk → eierlegende Wollmilchsau  	help → helfen → [context not equivalent, no direct match]  	experiencing difficulties → Schwierigkeiten hat → [context not equivalent, no direct match]
advert → Auftrag → Stelle  		**Explanation:** "Auftrag" in HYP is a mistranslation of "advert"/"Stelle" from SRC/REF, as "Auftrag" means "assignment" or "order," which changes the intended meaning and context. "Advert" refers to a job posting or advertisement.
people skills → Fachkenntnissen → Talent für Menschen  	jack-of-all-trades → Allhandelsjack → eierlegende Wollmilchsau
Deuschle → Duschle → Deuschle
No translation errors detected.
31-year-old → 31-Jahre → 31-Jährige  	sind → sind → ist  	Posten → Posten → dabei  		**Explanation:**  	- "31-Jahre" in HYP is a mistranslation of "31-year-old"/"31-Jährige" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning.	- "sind" in HYP is a mistranslation of "has been"/"ist" from SRC/REF, changing the grammatical structure.	- "Posten" in HYP is a mistranslation of the context implied as "in post", which is more correctly reflected as "dabei" in REF.
50% → 50% → 50-Prozent  	job → Arbeit → Stelle  	fixed term → festgelegte Amtszeit → befristet  		**Explanation:**  	- "50%" in HYP versus "50-Prozent" in REF signifies a stylistic discrepancy, but both convey the same numerical concept, hence it's listed.  	- "Arbeit" in HYP is a mistranslation of "job"/"Stelle" from SRC/REF, changing the type of employment term contextually.	- "festgelegte Amtszeit" is a mistranslation of "fixed term"/"befristet" from SRC/REF, as it inaccurately characterizes the duration as "official term" rather than "fixed term."
Deuschle → Duschle → Deuschle  	ehren- und hauptamtliche Akteure → Freiwillige und Vollzeitbeschäftigte → ehren- und hauptamtliche Akteure  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words in the HYP translation accurately reflect the meaning and intent of the SRC sentence, and any differences from the REF are considered minor and do not qualify as significant mistranslations.
located → angesiedelt → stehen		**Explanation:** "Angesiedelt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "located"/"stehen" from SRC/REF, changing the action's implied nature and context.
Problem → Problem → schwerwiegendes  	Zuhause → Zuhause → Wohnungen  	bescheinigt → bescheinigt → anerkannt
Communes → Gemeinschaften → Kommunen  	subsequent → spätere → Anschluss  
in ihrem Eigentum → in eigenen → in (their own)  	Mieteigentum → angemieteten Wohnräumen → rented properties  		**Explanation:** The translated phrase "in ihrem Eigentum" does not convey the same meaning as "in eigenen" from the REF. Additionally, "Mieteigentum" is a mistranslation of "rented properties", which should be "angemieteten Wohnräumen" as in the REF. These errors change the meaning significantly in the context of housing refugees.
No translation errors detected.
district administration → Stadtverwaltung → Landratsamt  	switches → erstreckt sich → wechselt  	communes → Gemeinden → Kommune  	job centres → Arbeitszentren → Jobcenter
Properties → Eigentum → Objekte  	landlord → Land → Vermieter  	let → lassen → anbieten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Eigentum" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Properties"/"Objekte", which changes the context significantly.	2. "Land" in HYP is a mistranslation of "landlord"/"Vermieter", altering the subject of the sentence.	3. "lassen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "let"/"anbieten", affecting the intended action.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence translates the meaning of the SRC sentence accurately into German, and no significant single-word translation errors are present. The differences between HYP and REF are stylistic and not indicative of mistranslations.
Häuser → Wohnungen
reliant → angewiesen → angewiesen  	homes → Privathaushalte → Privatwohnungen  		**Explanation:** The word "reliant" is translated as "angewiesen" in both HYP and REF, so there is no error here. However, "homes" is translated as "Privathaushalte" in HYP, whereas it is translated as "Privatwohnungen" in REF. This difference does not significantly alter the meaning, but there is a preference in REF for "Privatwohnungen". Nevertheless, since there is no clear incorrect translation impacting the meaning, no translation errors are detected.
1. homes → Häuser → Wohnungen  	2. commune's → Gemeinschaft → gemeindliche  	3. beefed up → vernichtet → ertüchtigt  		**Explanation:** "Houses" (HYP) should be "homes" (REF/SRC), "community" (HYP) should be "commune's" (REF/SRC), and "destroyed" (HYP) completely alters the meaning of "beefed up"/"revitalized" from REF/SRC.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While there are minor differences in phrasing between HYP and REF, such as "Demzufolge" for "Also" and "befinden" for "aufgestellt," both HYP and REF adequately convey the main aspects of the SRC sentence. The differences do not significantly change the meaning or context, and no specific single-word mistranslations are noticeable.
homes → Haushalte → Wohnungen  	do → machen → getan  
Perspective → Voraussicht → Perspektive  	Duschle → Duschle → Deuschle  		**Explanation:** "Voraussicht" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Perspective"/"Perspektive" from SRC/REF, changing the meaning. "Duschle" in HYP is a misspelling of "Deuschle" as per REF.
1. Aufenthalt → Aufenthalt → Bleibe  	2. Praktikanten → Praktikanten → Praktikumsplätze  	3. Lehrstellen → Lehrstellen → Ausbildungsstellen  	4. Praktikumsstellen → Praktikumsstellen → Jobs  	5. Zeitarbeitsstellen → Zeitarbeitsstellen → Aushilfstätigkeiten  		**Explanation:**  	- "Aufenthalt" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Bleibe" from REF.	- "Praktikanten" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Praktikumsplätze" from REF.	- "Lehrstellen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Ausbildungsstellen" from REF.	- "Praktikumsstellen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Jobs" from REF, as context suggests simplicity.	- "Zeitarbeitsstellen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Aushilfstätigkeiten" from REF.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although "Arbeitsplätze" in HYP is a more specific translation of "jobs" than "Plätze" in REF, it still accurately conveys the meaning without introducing errors in context or significantly altering the intended message.
people → Menschen → arbeiten  	builder's yards → Bauernhof → Bauhof  	caretakers → Betreuern → Hausmeistern  	provides → ist → motiviert  	voluntary work → freiwillige Arbeit → gemeinnützige Arbeit  	orderly → geordnete → ordentlich
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words in HYP and REF are synonymous or contextually fitting translations for the components of the SRC sentence, and there are no significant mismatches that alter the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.
Being → Aktives → Tätigkeit  	active → Handeln → Tätigkeit  		**Explanation:** "Aktives" (active) in HYP is incorrect compared to "Tätigkeit" (activity) in REF, which more accurately conveys the meaning of the SRC. "Handeln" (acting/doing) in HYP mistranslates the conjunction meaning of "Being" from SRC when compared to "Tätigkeit" in REF. Together, both "Aktives" and "Handeln" are mistranslations that significantly alter the message.
Deuschle → Deuchle → Deuschle
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation "müssen" and the REF translation "müssten" represent different modalities (indicative vs. subjunctive), but both can validly interpret "need" in the given context. Therefore, this discrepancy does not indicate a clear mistranslation as the overall meaning is retained.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence provides an accurate translation of the major components of the SRC sentence. The minor differences between HYP and REF are stylistic choices and do not represent clear single-word mistranslations that alter the meaning significantly.
Professional → Berufskurse → Professionelle  	rare → selten → rar  		**Explanation:** "Berufskurse" in HYP is a mistranslation of "professional"/"professionelle" from SRC/REF, changing the context since "Berufskurse" implies courses related to profession rather than the quality of being professional. "Selten" and "rar" both mean "rare", but for consistency with the REF, the change is noted.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** "Verwaltung" (administration) and "Freiwillige" (volunteers) in HYP correspond appropriately with the SRC, and differences from the REF are stylistic rather than errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words in the HYP sentence convey a meaning similar to the REF sentence, maintaining the overall context and intent of the SRC sentence. The differences are more stylistic than substantive single-word translation errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "Die Dauer der Prozesse ist ein Problem" in the HYP is an accurate translation of "The length of time that processes take is a problem" from the SRC, except for minor differences like the omission of "lange" and a slight difference in tense ("sei" vs. "ist"). However, these do not constitute distinct single-word translation errors.
explain → erklären → erklären  	None detected.		**Explanation:** In this case, there are no distinct single-word translation errors between HYP and REF when compared to the SRC. The translations of key terms remain consistent and correct across the sentences. Note: While some translation choices differ (e.g., "sinnvoll" vs "produktiv"), they do not constitute single-word errors that change meaning significantly enough to be flagged.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP is a suitable German translation of the SRC sentence. While there are differences in phrasing compared to the REF, there are no single-word mistranslations that alter the overall meaning significantly.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:**  	The difference between "klare" in HYP and "deutliche" in REF is a minor synonym variation, both adequately translating "clear" from SRC. Similarly, "ist" in HYP and "sei" in REF are appropriate translations capturing the sense of "are" in the context of the sentence. Hence, no significant single-word translation errors are present.
Deuschle → Duchle → Deuschle  		**Explanation:** "Duchle" in HYP is a mistranslation of "Deuschle" from both SRC and REF, changing the proper name and context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP translation is a viable rendition of the SRC sentence, capturing the essential meaning without significant errors. There are no single-word discrepancies that misrepresent the SRC into the HYP when compared to the REF.
No translation errors detected.
sagte → sagt → sagt  	nicht ignorieren → nicht ausschließen → nicht ausschließen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "sagte" (HYP) is past tense, while "sagt" (REF) is present tense, which matches the present tense used in the SRC sentence.	2. "nicht ignorieren" (HYP) translates to "not ignore," whereas "nicht ausschließen" (REF) translates to "not rule out," which better captures the meaning intended in the SRC and REF sentences.
No translation errors detected.
These → Fragen → Vorfälle
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence "Viele von ihnen möchten gern in Urbach bleiben." adequately translates the SRC sentence "Many of them would like to stay in Urbach." with no significant mistranslation when compared to the REF sentence "Viele würden gerne in Urbach bleiben." The difference between the HYP and REF involves permissible variations that do not alter the original meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While there are some differences in word choice between HYP and REF, such as "Vollzeitbeschäftigte" vs. "Hauptamtliche" and "Freiwillige" vs. "Ehrenamtliche," these do not constitute errors as they are valid synonyms in this context. The overall meaning is preserved compared to the SRC.
**back → Hinterkopf → Hintergrund**  		**group → Gruppe → Stoß**  		**arriving → kommen → kommen könnte über**  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Hinterkopf" (HYP) does not fit the context as well as "Hintergrund" (REF) for "back" in this sentence.	2. "Gruppe" (HYP) is a direct translation of "group" but "Stoß" (REF) is preferred for expressing an influx or batch of people.	3. "kommen" (HYP) translates to "arriving"; however, "kommen könnte über" from REF captures the potential nature better in context.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
show → zu zeigen → zu stellen
Deuschle → Duschle → Deuschle
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The HYP and REF translations, although structured differently, do not present any single-word errors that significantly alter the meaning from the SRC sentence. The words in HYP adequately convey the meaning of the original SRC and match with the intentions expressed in the REF.
Urbach → Urbacher → Bewohner  	voll → ausgelastet → ausgelastet  	können → sind → sind  	Flüchtlinge → Menschen → Menschen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Urbach" in HYP should be "Urbacher" like in REF to correctly refer to the residents of Urbach.	- "Voll" is not contextually fitting; "ausgelastet" better reflects the meaning as used in REF.	- "Können" implies capability, whereas "sind" indicates that the residents are already occupied as in REF.	- "Flüchtlinge" is used in a context where "Menschen" is a more accurate, inclusive term as per REF.

No translation errors detected.
Search → Suche → gesucht  	intruders → Eindringlingen → Einbrecher  		**Explanation:**  	- In the context of the sentence, "Search" should be translated as "gesucht" and not "Suche". This changes the verb form and context of the sentence.	- "Intruders" is better translated as "Einbrecher" rather than "Eindringlingen", which is a less precise translation in this context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence effectively conveys the same meaning as the SRC sentence, with minor wording differences compared to the REF, but no significant mistranslations were identified.
1. apartement → Wohnung → Wohnung  		**Explanation:** "Apartement" in HYP is a mistranslation of "apartment"/"Wohnung" from SRC/REF, leading to a different meaning and context.
residents → Bewohner → Bewohner  	fled → Flüchtlinge → Unholde  		**Explanation:** "Bewohner" in HYP accurately refers to "residents" in the context, thus no error. However, "Flüchtlinge" (meaning "refugees" in German) is a significant mistranslation of the word "men" in SRC and "Unholde" in REF, which refers to "men" or "villains." The main mistranslation here is the interpretation of action "fled," not accurately captured by "Flüchtlinge."
1. meters → Millionen → Meter  	2. hooded tops → Hotpots → Kapuzenpullis  		**Explanation:**  	- "Millionen" in HYP is a mistranslation of "meters"/"Meter" from SRC/REF, significantly altering the meaning regarding height.  	- "Hotpots" in HYP is a mistranslation of "hooded tops"/"Kapuzenpullis" from SRC/REF, changing the type of clothing referred to.
No translation errors detected.
strip → streifende → Streifenbesatzungen
No translation errors detected.
unbekannten Angreifer → Unbekannten → Unbekannten  	Flugs → Flucht → Flucht  		**Explanation:**  	- "Angreifer" in HYP is a mistranslation as it specifically translates to "attackers", which changes the context compared to "unbekannten" or "unknown individuals" in REF.	- "Flugs" in HYP is a mistranslation, as it translates to "flight," rather than the intended "Flucht" meaning "escape."
1. bikers → Fahrern → Rocker  	2. snack bar → Snack-Bar → Imbiss  
Angriff → Peitsche → Attacke  	Imbiss → Peitsche → Imbiss  	bikeren → bikeren → Rockermilieu  		**Explanation:**  	- "Peitsche" in HYP is an incorrect translation for "snack stand" and should be "Imbiss" as in REF.  	- "bikeren" directly relates incorrectly to the context, where "Rockermilieu" is more appropriate.
House → Parlament → Wohnungsdurchsuchungen  	searches → Nachforschungen → Wohnungsdurchsuchungen  	evidence → Beweise → Beweismittel  	drugs → Drogen → Rauschgift
masked → versteckte → maskierte  	biker-esque → Bikeresker → rockerähnlichen  	snack bar → Schneebar → Imbisses  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Versteckte" in HYP mistranslates "masked" from SRC, which is correctly translated as "maskierte" in REF.	2. "Bikeresker" in HYP mistranslates "biker-esque" from SRC, which refers to "rockerähnlichen" in REF.	3. "Schneebar" in HYP mistranslates "snack bar" from SRC, which is correctly translated as "Imbisses" in REF.
Kunden → Gäste → Gäste
No translation errors detected.
- Snackbar → Imbiss → Imbiss  	- wurden → entstand → entstand  		**Explanation:**  	- "Snackbar" in HYP incorrectly translates "snack bar"/"Imbiss" from SRC/REF.  	- "wurden" in HYP is a mistranslation and alters the meaning contextually; it should reflect "entstand" as in REF.
glauben → glauben → zufolge  	großen → großen → Rockermilieu  	Banden → Banden → Gang  		**Explanation:** The translation for "believe" (glauben) could have been more accurately translated as "zufolge" to match the reference context. "Biker gangs" is translated to "großen Banden," which does not capture the specific subculture implied by "Rockermilieu" in the reference. Additionally, "Gangs" in the source context have more accurate translations and implications in the reference.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The HYP sentence effectively conveys the same meaning as the SRC sentence. The variation between "strong" and "high" demand ("starke" versus "hohe" Nachfrage) is minor and does not significantly alter the meaning. Both words are suitable translations for the context provided.
percent → % → Prozent  	turnover → Umsatz → Konzernumsatz  		**Explanation:**  	1. "percent" is translated as "%" in HYP but is translated as "Prozent" in REF, which is more contextually aligned with complete words rather than symbols.	2. "turnover" is translated as "Umsatz" in HYP but as "Konzernumsatz" in REF, suggesting a more specific term in the reference that aligns with "company's turnover" from SRC.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The translation in HYP accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and aligns well with the reference translation. The differences are stylistic choices or synonymous phrases rather than mistranslations.
Jena-based → in Dschena ansässige → Jenaer  	medical technology company → medizinische Unternehmen → Medizintechnik-Konzern  	Board of Directors → Verwaltungsrat → Vorstand
Zeiss → Zeis → Zeiss  	produces → produziert → stellt ... her
company → Unternehmen → Unternehmen  	firm → Firma → Konzern  	people → Menschen → Mitarbeiter		**Note:** The list above is only for illustrative purposes based on the structure you've provided. According to your task guidelines, significant errors should be listed while overlooking minor discrepancies such as synonyms. 		Upon review, the most critical and impactful translation errors identified are:		**Expected Output:**		firm → ­ und Elektronikfirma → Konzern  	people → Menschen → Mitarbeiter  		**Explanation:**  	- **Firm:** HYP translates "firm" as "­ und Elektronikfirma," whereas REF uses "Konzern," which better reflects the business entity context in this sentence.  	- **People:** While technically correct, "Menschen" in HYP could be mistranslated for "employees," where "Mitarbeiter" in REF is more specific and contextually appropriate.
