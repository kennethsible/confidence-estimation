28-Year-Old → alter → jähriger  	Chef → Chef → Koch  	Found → Fond → aufgefunden  		**Explanation:** "alter" (old, incorrect usage here) is a mistranslation of "Year-Old", which changes the structure describing the person's age. "Chef" is mistranslated as "Chef", the English word "chef" should be translated to "Koch" in German for "cook". "Fond" is a mistranslation of "Found", which should be "aufgefunden". These errors violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
chef → Chef → Koch  	stairwell → Stirwell → Treppenhaus  	mall → Mühle → Einkaufszentrum  		**Explanation:** "Chef" in German usually means a boss or manager, not a cook, making it a mistranslation of the English "chef," which should be "Koch" in this context. "Stirwell" appears to be a misspelled or incorrect rendering of "stairwell," which should be "Treppenhaus." Finally, "Mühle" means "mill" in German, which is an incorrect translation of "mall," which should be "Einkaufszentrum." These errors significantly alter the intended meaning, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
think → sagen → vorstellen  	going → gut → bergauf  		**Explanation:** "sagen" (saying) is a mistranslation of "think", which should be "vorstellen" (imagine, think of). "gut" (well) is a mistranslation of "going" in the context of improvement, which should be "bergauf" (uphill or improving). The mistranslation of these words significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
body → Gremium → Leichnam  	resident → Präsident → Anwohner  	Galicia → Galicien → Galicia  		**Explanation:**  	"Gremium" (committee) is a mistranslation of "body" in this context, where "Leichnam" (corpse) is correct. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since the intended meaning is about a deceased person.  	"Präsident" (president) is a mistranslation of "resident". This is a significant error since it changes the identified role of Frank Galicia, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.  	"Galicien" (Galicia, a region) is mistranslated; the correct conversion of the name "Galicia" is to retain its form as it is a proper noun referring to a person.
death → Tod → Mord		**Explanation:** "Tod" (death) was repeated instead of being translated as "Mord" (homicide), significantly altering the meaning of the sentence. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it removes the indication of a criminal cause of death.
Louis Galicia → Louis Galicien → Louis Galicia   	station → Bahnhof → Sender  	line cook → Linienkoch → Koch  	line chef → Leiter des Restaurants → Koch  		**Explanation:**  	- "Louis Galicien" is a mistranslation of "Louis Galicia". This follows the **Identify Mistranslations** rule because the proper name should remain unchanged.	- "Bahnhof" (station) is a mistranslation of "station" in the context of a broadcasting station. The correct term is "Sender", adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Linienkoch" is a direct but incorrect translation of "line cook". While "Linienkoch" could be a literal translation, the common term in German is simply "Koch", respecting the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "Leiter des Restaurants" (head of the restaurant) does not match "line chef", which is a type of cook, specifically "Koch" in this context. The mistranslation substantially alters the job description, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
spokesperson → Sprecher → Sprecherin	they → er → sie	devastated → entsetzt → am Boden zerstört		**Explanation:** "Sprecher" refers to a male spokesperson, while "Sprecherin" would be used for a female; however, since gender may not be specified in the original, this isn't necessarily an error unless context clarifies. But since the rest relates to the rest of the sentence, it could reflect incorrect gender reference context, so not a necessary error in this case. "Er" (he) is a mistranslation of "they", which should be "sie" (they) as "they" in this context clearly refers to a group, as indicated by "Sons & Daughters", also conforming with the plural verb forms like "seien". "Entsetzt" (appalled) is not as strong as "am Boden zerstört" (devastated) which significantly fits the emotional context provided by "shocked and devastated"; both words should reflect the intensity of emotion described, not easily exchangeable with a different intensity word in this context.
knit → Nackt → [omit]	he → wird → ihn	dearly → teuer → schmerzlich  		**Explanation:** "Nackt" (naked) is a mistranslation in the phrase "close knit family", where "knit" should be omitted as it is not directly translated in German. "wird" (will) does not accurately translate "he" in this context, as the proper form is "ihn" referring to "him" being missed. "teuer" (expensively/dearly in a monetary sense) is a mistranslation of "dearly" in the context of being "missed dearly," which in German is "schmerzlich". These errors are significant as they alter the intended meaning conveyed in the source sentence.
Frank's → der → Franks		**Explanation:** "der Familie" in the candidate translation omits the proper noun "Frank's". This is a significant translation error, as it removes a specific reference to Frank's family, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Galicia → Galicien → Galicia  	hostels → Hotels → Hostels  	things → ging → Dinge		**Explanation:**		1. **Galicia → Galicien:** "Galicien" is a mistranslation of the name "Galicia." Proper nouns like names should remain consistent unless there is a widely accepted translation.	  	2. **hostels → Hotels:** "Hotels" is a mistranslation of "hostels." In this context, "hostels" and "hotels" refer to different types of accommodation, and the mistranslation changes the meaning.	  	3. **things → ging:** In the context of "Things were finally going well for him," the translated sentence fails to convey the specific notion of "things" ("Dinge" in German). The word "ging" (went) does not accurately represent "things" in this sentence. 		These errors significantly change the meaning or context, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
found → brachte → fand  	dating → brachte → hatte  	Galicia → Galicien → Garcia  		**Explanation:** "brachte" (brought) is incorrect for "found" and "dating," which is a severe change in meaning. "brachte" is also contextually wrong when understanding the relationship aspect intended by "dating." "Galicien" is a mistranslation of "Galicia," which seems to be a mistake in translating a proper noun with a different reference equivalence, given "Garcia" as the correct term in the reference.
anyone → niemanden → niemanden   	hurt → treffen → schaden  		**Explanation:** "niemanden" is used correctly for "anyone" in this context, so there is no error there. However, "treffen" (meet) is a mistranslation of "hurt." The German word "schaden" correctly conveys the intended harm or injury in the context of the sentence. The candidate translation suggests a non-violent meeting, while the source and reference sentences imply potential harm.
spirit → Geist → Mensch		**Explanation:** "Geist" (spirit) is a mistranslation of "Mensch" (person or human). The intended meaning in context is that he was a kind person, not literally a spirit. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it changes the interpretation of the sentence from a figurative expression to a literal interpretation.
way → Verbindung → Art  	connecting → machte → verbinden  	mouth → Mund → kochen  	dinner → Essen → Abendessen  		**Explanation:** "Verbindung" (connection) is a mistranslation of "way". It does not convey the intended method or manner of action that "Art" implies. "machte" (made) is a mistranslation of "connecting", which refers to the action of establishing a connection, correctly translated as "verbinden". "Mund" (mouth) is a significant mistranslation for "dish" or preparing something, which was meant to be "kochen" (cook). Lastly, "Essen" (food) is too broad for "dinner", which is specific as "Abendessen" in this context.
wanted → wollte → wollte nie  	altercation → ändern → Auseinandersetzung  		**Explanation:** "wollte" (wanted) seems correct at first, but the inclusion of "to be" translates to "wollte nie" in the reference, maintaining meaning. "ändern" (to change) is a mistranslation of "altercation", which significantly alters the meaning of the sentence. This violates both the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, as "change" is not synonymous with "altercation" in context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "ging" (went), and the reference uses "schwamm" (swam). While "ging" could be seen as less literal compared to "schwamm", the phrase "mit dem Strom" in German idiomatically means going with the flow, regardless of the verb used, as long as it conveys the appropriate sense of following along or conforming to the situation. Therefore, it does not significantly affect the meaning of the sentence. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
diamond → Diamant → ungeschliffene  	rough → Grub → ungeschliffene  		**Explanation:** "Diamant" is a partial mistranslation as it omits the description "ungeschliffene" (rough), which modifies its meaning significantly, thus violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule as “rough” was not rendered. "Grub" appears to be an erroneous translation attempt for "rough", which is not contextually correct nor related to the intended meaning.
information → Informationen → Informationen  	SFPD → SPD → SFPD  	call → nennen → anrufen  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Information" is translated to "Informationen" in both candidate and reference translations, so there is no error in the candidate translation for this word.		2. "SFPD" in the source is mistranslated as "SPD" in the candidate. "SFPD" refers to the San Francisco Police Department, while "SPD" could be confused with other meanings, leading to misunderstandings.		3. "call" should be translated as "anrufen" (to call) rather than "nennen" (to name), as the intended action is to make a phone call, not to give a name. This significantly alters the meaning within the context.
Aniston → Antison → Aniston  	pigeonholed → gepioniert → in Schubladen gesteckt  		**Explanation:** "Antison" is a misspelling of "Aniston" and changes the proper noun. This follows the **Identify Mistranslations** rule because proper names should be preserved accurately. "gepioniert" does not convey the meaning of "pigeonholed". The correct translation "in Schubladen gesteckt" accurately represents the intended idiomatic expression of being categorized or stereotyped, aligning with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation matches the reference translation exactly. There are no mistranslations, as each word in the candidate translation corresponds correctly to the meaning of the source sentence. This adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as there are no changes in meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, maintaining the correct context. While "jetzt unmissverständlich klar gemacht" from the reference can translate to "made abundantly clear now," the candidate's "sehr deutlich gemacht" (made very clear) is an acceptable variation that doesn't significantly alter the meaning. Thus, in adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no significant mistranslations are present.
pigeonholed → gepioniert → in Schubladen gesteckt
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Ich persönlich möchte nicht immer perfekt und erfolgreich sein" effectively conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. Both "Ich persönlich" and "Ich selbst" are acceptable interpretations of "Personally," and the rendering of "desire" as "möchte" instead of "habe nicht den Wunsch" does not significantly alter the meaning in this context. The rest of the sentence aligns well with the source, maintaining the meaning throughout. According to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, there are no significant translation errors to report.
give a damn → verhehle → schnuppe  		**Explanation:** "verhehle" means "conceal", which doesn't convey the intended sentiment of indifference present in "give a damn" and "schnuppe". This mistranslation changes the meaning of the sentence, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Miss → Frau → Miss  	issue → Frage → Ausgabe  		**Explanation:** "Frau" (woman) is a mistranslation of "Miss", which changes the intended meaning of the title. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "Frage" (question) is a mistranslation of "issue", which alters the context.
hair → Haar → Dutt  	bun → Bub → Dutt  	food → Lebensmittel → Essen  	magazine → Zeitungsberichte → Magazin  		**Explanation:**  	- "Haar" (hair) in context could refer to a "Dutt" (bun) rather than just "hair", as indicated by the reference, making "Haar" incorrect given the subsequent mistranslation.	- "Bub" (boy) is an inaccurate translation of "bun", significantly altering the meaning related to hairstyle.	- "Lebensmittel" (groceries/foodstuffs) is a mistranslation of "food" in the specific context of a meal, where "Essen" (food/meal) is more appropriate.	- "Zeitungsberichte" (newspaper reports) is incorrect for "magazine" where "Magazin" is the precise term.
question → Frage → Frage  	livid → Leben → Zur Weißglut  	star → Stern → Star		**Explanation:**  	1. **livid → Leben → Zur Weißglut**: "Leben" (life) is an incorrect translation for "livid", as it significantly changes the meaning from indicating anger to something about life. "Zur Weißglut" (incensed or made her livid) is the correct referential meaning.  	2. **star → Stern → Star**: "Stern" (star, as in celestial body) is less appropriate contextually compared to "Star" (star, as in celebrity), which matches the intended meaning referring to the Hollywood star.
love → liebe → Liebe  	isn't → nicht → ist kein  	single → einzige → alleinerziehende  		**Explanation:**  	1. "liebe" should be capitalized as "Liebe" in this context because it is a noun, aligning with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.  	2. "nicht" is a mistranslation for "isn't", which should be "ist kein", following the **Identify Mistranslations** rule, since it changes the meaning of the film title significantly.  	3. "einzige" does not capture the meaning of "single" in the context of "single mother", where "alleinerziehende" is the correct translation. This adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it clarifies her marital status.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Der Film wird am 25. August in Deutschland freigegeben" closely adheres to the source sentence's meaning. Despite the different phrasing in the reference, "freigegeben" (released) appropriately captures the intended meaning of the film being made available, while all other aspects of the sentence, such as the date and location, are correctly translated. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, as there are no words that significantly change the meaning in context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "ausgezeichnet" (awarded) and "erhält" (receives) can convey similar meanings in this context when considering these translations. The candidate translation conveys the correct meaning, in line with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, since the essential meaning of receiving an accolade is retained.
experience → Erfahrungen → Erfahrungen  	horseback → Pferdeweg → Pferd  		**Explanation:** "Erfahrungen" is translated correctly and doesn't demonstrate an error. "Pferdeweg" (horse trail/path) is a mistranslation of "horseback", which changes the activity he is involved in. The reference translation uses "Pferd" (horse) to more accurately reflect being on horseback. Therefore, these translations include significant mistakes that align with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
tournament → goldenen → Golfturniers  	ride → Strand → Ausritt  		**Explanation:** "goldenen" (golden) is a mistranslation of "tournament", which significantly changes the meaning of the original sentence. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "Strand" (beach) in "an den Strand getrieben" misrepresents the action of "went for a ride," as it incorrectly implies moving to the beach rather than taking a ride along it. Hence, "Strand" is the most significant error in this context, reducing the phrase to a single word error.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While the structure of the candidate translation differs from the reference translation, the key words "first" is translated as "Premiere" and "58-year-old" as "58-Jahre", which are contextually acceptable for conveying the intended meaning in German.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation is identical to the reference translation. Every word corresponds correctly to the source and maintains the intended meaning, following the **No translation errors detected** rule.
horse → Pferd → Pferde		decided → beschlossen → erinnerten		feeding → Fütterung → Futtertrögen		**Explanation:** 		1. "Pferd" (singular) is used while the reference uses "Pferde" (plural). This is an error in counting.	2. "beschlossen" (decided) is used in the candidate but conflicts with "erinnerten" (remembered), altering the reasoning for going home.	3. "Fütterung" (feeding) does not fit the context of "Futtertrögen" (feeding troughs), which are specific objects.
kilometre → Kilometer → Kilometer (considered correct)	scared → Angst gemacht → Angst gehabt  		**Explanation:** "Kilometer" is an acceptable translation of "kilometre." However, the phrase "wurde mir Angst gemacht" is a mistranslation of "I was scared." The reference phrase "ich habe Angst gehabt" accurately reflects the intended meaning of being frightened, and the word "gemacht" improperly changes the structure and meaning. Therefore, "scared → Angst gemacht → Angst gehabt" is recorded as an error.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence. "Es war keine gute Erfahrung" (It wasn't a good experience) is an acceptable translation of the source sentence. Although "Erlebnis" (experience) is used in the reference, "Erfahrung" is a valid alternative that doesn't significantly change the meaning. Additionally, "sagte" (said) corresponds well with the source "said," and the tense discrepancy ("sagte" vs "sagt") does not alter comprehension notably, hence no error is reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although the candidate translation uses different syntactic structures and synonyms ("Fahrerlaufbahn" vs. "Reitkarriere"), these variations are acceptable and do not significantly change the meaning of the original sentence. Therefore, there are no errors according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
golfer → Golf → Golfer  	time → Zeit → Zeiten  	tournament → Tumults → Turnier  
toured → besucht → führen  	jump → gestoßen → schwang  
Langer's → Langer → Langer  	(Incorrect structure affects clarity, but "Langer" is correctly translated as "Langer", hence no single-word error here.)		was → war → war  	(first time in Aachen → erstes Mal in Aachen → erstes Mal in Aachen)  		and → und → und  		at CHIO → in CHIO → beim CHIO  	(CHIO is an event and "in" is less appropriate than "beim", which indicates attendance at an event. This points to a structural accuracy issue but doesn't translate to a single-word mistake here.)		**Explanation:** The translation suffers from structural issues that affect readability, but there are no single-word errors that significantly change the intended meaning when separating structure from lexical translation. Therefore, by focusing solely on word-level accuracy, we detect:	**No translation errors detected.**
convinced → überzeugt → überzeugend  		**Explanation:** "überzeugt" (convinced) in the candidate translation does not match the passive form which would be "überzeugend" (convincing) in the reference. This aligns with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the form should be passive to match the source sentence, where "He had been convinced" implies being persuaded, a state of experiencing an action rather than performing it.
**(Sport Aid → Sportbeihilfestiftung → Sporthilfe)**		**(from → von → aus)**		**Explanation:**	1. "Sport Aid" is mistranslated as "Sportbeihilfestiftung" instead of the correct "Sporthilfe". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Sportbeihilfestiftung" is not the established name for the organization.	2. "from" is mistranslated as "von" instead of "aus". This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, as "von Anhausen" could imply a broader association than "aus Anhausen," which matches the reference interpretation.
friendly → befreundete → sympathischen  		**Explanation:** "befreundete" translates to "befriended", which is incorrect for the intended meaning of "friendly". The reference uses "sympathischen" to correctly convey the idea of "friendly". The remaining translation retains the meaning, so no other errors are reported.
Federal Cross of Merit → Federal Kreuz des Verdienstes → Bundesverdienstkreuz  	Silver Laurel Leaf → Silber-Laurel → Silbernes Lorbeerblatt  		**Explanation:** "Federal Kreuz des Verdienstes" does not properly translate "Federal Cross of Merit" and should be "Bundesverdienstkreuz," as seen in the reference. "Silber-Laurel" is incorrect for "Silver Laurel Leaf" and should be "Silbernes Lorbeerblatt." These changes violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules as they alter the names of official awards.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In this context, "Königin" (Queen) is an acceptable translation for "Queen", and "eine Ehre erwiesen" (bestowed an honour) is a reasonable translation choice here compared to "geadelt" (knighted). The candidate translation maintains the essence and intent of the source sentence, thereby aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
person → Mann → Preisträger  		**Explanation:** "Mann" (man) is a mistranslation of "person". The source sentence refers to "person", which is gender-neutral and more akin to "Preisträger" (awardee), fitting better with the context of being awarded the "Sport Pyramid". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by unnecessarily specifying a gender.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Am Samstag traf er die erste Person, die es empfing, Hans Günter Winkler, in Aachen." closely aligns with both the source sentence and the reference translation in terms of meaning. The phrase "die erste Person, die es empfing" (the first person to receive it) is a valid translation for "the first person to receive it", and the other elements like "Hans Günter Winkler" and "in Aachen" are accurately translated. Therefore, following the instructions and given the semantic accuracy, there are no single-word translation errors to report.
award → Preis → Auszeichnung  	means → dient → bedeutet  	social → sozialen → gesellschaftliches  		**Explanation:** 	- "Preis" (prize) is a mistranslation of "award". "Auszeichnung" (recognition) is a more appropriate translation in this context, as it conveys a broader notion of honor and recognition rather than a physical prize.	- "dient" (serves) is a mistranslation of "means". In this context, "bedeutet" (means/signifies) is the correct translation that conveys the personal significance of the award to Langer.	- "sozialen" (social) is a mistranslation of "social" in this context. "gesellschaftliches" (societal) better captures the intended focus on broader societal engagement or commitment.
Langer → Zeit → Langer  	encouraging → gezeigt → fördert  		**Explanation:** "Zeit" (time) is a mistranslation of the name "Langer", which alters the subject of the sentence. "gezeigt" (shown) is a mistranslation of "encouraging", which changes the meaning of Langer's role in supporting talent. This is in line with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as both errors significantly impact the intended meaning of the sentence.
passed → bewilligt → gab  	prize money → Preisgelder → Preisgeld  		**Explanation:**  	1. "bewilligt" translates to "approved" instead of "passed", which changes the intended action taken regarding the money.	2. "Preisgelder" (plural) suggests multiple prize monies, whereas "Preisgeld" (singular) aligns with the singular reference and source word "prize money". This error is prioritized as it alters the singular nature of the prize, which is important for correct understanding.
two-time → Zwei-Master-Kämpfer → zweifache   	German → Deutsche → deutschen   	Sports → Sport → Sports   		**Explanation:**  	- "Zwei-Master-Kämpfer" (Two-Master-Fighter) is a mistranslation of "two-time", which refers to the number of times the championship has been won. The "Fighter" part is contextually incorrect as it changes the nature of the subject.  	- "Deutsche" (German) should be appropriately declined as "deutschen" to match the reference translation in terms of grammatical context.  	- "Sport" (Sport) in German requires grammatical alignment to "Sports" to accurately represent the contextual use related to the Hall of Fame. This matches the specific formal naming convention of the reference translation.
track → Spurhaltesportler → Leichtathleten  	Hartwig → Hartweig → Hartwig  	fencers → Zäuner → Fechter  	rower → Krüger → Ruderer  	Peter-Michael → Peter → Peter-Michael  	bob-sleigh rider → blühender Richter → Bob-Fahrer  	(posthumously) → möglicherweise → posthum  		**Explanation:**		1. "Spurhaltesportler" (lane-keeping athlete) is a mistranslation of "track athletes," significantly diverging from the intended meaning.	2. "Hartweig" is a misspelling of "Hartwig," affecting the correct naming of an athlete.	3. "Zäuner" (fencer, but incorrect form) is improper compared to "Fechter," which is the correct term in this context.	4. "Krüger" (refers to a surname, incorrect here) is used instead of "Ruderer" (rower).	5. "Peter" fails to capture the full name "Peter-Michael," which is used in the reference.	6. "blühender Richter" (flowering judge) is nonsensical here and incorrect for "bob-sleigh rider."	7. "möglicherweise" (possibly) doesn't capture the meaning of "posthumously," distorting the timeline of the honor given.
legends → Sportlernen → Sportlegenden		**Explanation:** "Sportlernen" (sport learning) is a mistranslation of "legends". The correct translation should maintain the meaning of legendary figures, not sport-related learning. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since it changes the intended meaning related to renowned sports figures.
illustrious → wunderbare → illustre  	gathering → Zusammenkunft → Gesellschaft  	wandered → geflogen → wanderte  	show-jumping → Show-up → Spring  		**Explanation:**  	1. "wunderbare" (wonderful) is a mistranslation of "illustrious", which significantly changes the description of the gathering, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	2. "Zusammenkunft" (meeting) does not accurately convey "gathering" as a community of people in this context; "Gesellschaft" (society/gathering) is more appropriate and fits the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	3. "geflogen" (flown) is incorrect in place of "wandered", leading to a misunderstanding of the movement described, and thus breaking the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	4. "Show-up" is a mistranslation of "show-jumping", which changes the meaning significantly. "Springstadion" (jumping stadium) is the correct term, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence "Bernhard Langer hat sich von den großen Tieren ferngehalten" maintains the intended meaning of "kept his distance from the large animals" even though there's a slight variation in expression. The core components such as "großen Tieren" for "large animals" are correctly translated, and "sich ferngehalten" effectively conveys "kept his distance." Thus, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, there are no meaningful errors reported.
Clinton's → Trumpf → Trumps		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation, "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump" in the context of the economic policies. The second occurrence of "Clinton's" as "Clinton" is permissible, so it doesn't require highlighting as an error.
Clinton → Trumpf → Trump  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely represents the source sentence, maintaining the intended meanings of the words aligning with the reference. There are no significant single-word errors that change the meaning or context compared to the reference translation.
Trump's → Trumpf → Trump		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Trumpf" instead of "Trump," which is a misspelling of the name "Donald Trump." This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as proper names should be translated correctly to maintain the intended reference and meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The source sentence is accurately translated into German as "Das ist die Rolle des Staates." The candidate translation matches the intended meaning from the source sentence, and there are no significant single-word translation errors. The candidate sentence maintains the contextual integrity of the source.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump". The reference and candidate sentences align in context, but the candidate translation mistakenly changes the name, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as proper nouns should remain consistent.
want → will → wolle  	lead → führen → besteuern  		**Explanation:** "will" is a mistranslation of the source "wants" which changes the meaning from a present desire to a future intention, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "führen" (lead) is incorrectly translated for the intended action of "besteuern" (tax), significantly altering the intended meaning in the context.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" (trump card or an incorrect translation here) is a mistranslation of "Trump", which is a proper noun and should not change across languages. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it does not accurately represent the name mentioned in the source sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essential meaning of the source sentence. Both "Verordnungen aufheben" and "Regulierungen massiv zurückfahren" pertain to the concept of repealing or scaling back regulations, and the meaning is preserved. Similarly, "umfassende Steuerreform mit niedrigen Steuersätzen" aligns with the notion of "lead a wide-reaching tax reform with low rates," capturing the overall concept accurately. Therefore, based on the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, there are no demonstrated errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with the reference, maintaining the intended meaning and context. Variations like "hingegen" versus "dagegen" and "indem er benachteiligten Menschen Chancen gibt" versus "er hat Benachteiligten Chancen zu eröffnen" do not significantly alter the original message, thus adhering to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the meaning and essential elements of the source sentence accurately. While there's a small discrepancy like "this" translated as "das" instead of "deshalb," this does not significantly alter the underlying meaning in the context. Therefore, no single-word translation errors are detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Interessanterweise haben sie ähnliche Ansichten zur Infrastruktur" conveys the meaning of the source sentence accurately. While there are differences in phrasing compared to the reference translation "Interessanterweise sind sich beide sehr nahe beim Thema Infrastruktur," both translations convey the same idea of having similar views on infrastructure. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump". This violates the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule because "Trumpf" does not contextually fit or appropriately translate the name "Trump". Names should be directly translated without alteration unless specified by the language norms, which is not the case here.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation is a valid representation of the source sentence. Key ideas, such as "Democratic candidate" ("demokratische Kandidat"), "announced" ("angekündigt"), and "largest investment in jobs" ("größte Investition in Arbeitsplätze"), are accurately translated. "Kandidat" is acceptable for either gender, and minor differences in connectors and structure do not significantly alter the intended meaning. Thus, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no errors are reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the meaning of the source sentence accurately. Although there are differences in word choice and construction when compared to the reference translation, such as "klassische demokratische Politiken" and "klassische demokratische Politik," these are minor variations and do not significantly alter the meaning conveyed. Therefore, per the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** guideline, no errors are reported.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" (trump card) is a mistranslation of "Trump", referring to the person Donald Trump. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it introduces an incorrect concept into the context, shifting the meaning from a person to a playing card term.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation differs stylistically from the reference translation, but the meaning remains intact. "Es gibt deutlichere Unterschiede in der Energie- und Klimapolitik" conveys the same essential content as the specific phrasing of the source and reference sentences. Thus, there are no single-word mistranslations that significantly alter the meaning, in adherence to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	coal production → Kohleproduktion → Kohleförderung  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Trumpf" is not the correct version of the name "Trump".  	2. "Kohleproduktion" (coal production) is not an incorrect translation but could be considered slightly different in nuance from "Kohleförderung" (coal extraction or mining), which is closer to the reference. Given the context, "production" and "extraction" can be distinct, so we consider "Kohleproduktion" an error here, keeping in mind **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and focusing on significant meaning changes.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence closely matches the reference in terms of meaning and key elements. Although there are slight differences in phrasing ("Ölbohrungen" vs. "Ölförderung", "sollten erlaubt sein" vs. "soll möglich sein", "zurückziehen" vs. "aufkündigen"), these do not result in significant changes in meaning and are considered acceptable variations. Thus, there are no significant single-word errors detected that alter the intended meaning of the sentence.
es → es → sie (the pronoun "it" in "indem es sagt" incorrectly refers to "Clinton", who should be referred to with "sie" for "saying")		sagt → sagt → fordert (the verb "sagt" is a translation of "saying" but the reference uses "fordert", which is more contextually accurate as "demands" or "calls for")		sauberen → erneuerbarer → sauberen (in the context of energy, "clean" is better translated as "sauber", but the candidate uses "erneuerbarer", which means "renewable" but refers to more specific intention) 		jobs → Arbeitsplätzen → Jobs ("Arbeitsplätzen" fits in the context but "Jobs" is a clearer translation with a direct correspondence in the reference translation)	
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation successfully captures the meaning and intent of the source sentence, with no single-word errors that significantly change the meaning. Both translations express the choice among countries and the speaker's preference clearly, adhering strictly to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
international → internationale → internationalen  		**Explanation:** "internationale" is a mistranslation of "internationalen" because the adjective should match the case and number of the noun it modifies. In this context, "Handelsabkommen" is plural and requires the correct inflection on "international" to maintain grammatical accuracy. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
(TTP → TTP → TPP)  	Neither want to → Auch will nicht → wollen beide nicht  		**Explanation:**  	1. TTP is a mistranslation of "TPP", which is an acronym for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and should be corrected as it is crucial for the meaning.	2. "Auch will nicht" translates to "also does not want", which does not accurately convey the meaning of "Neither want to". "wollen beide nicht" ("both do not want") correctly expresses the intent of neither party wanting to sign the agreement. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by addressing both parties' unwillingness.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** While there are differences between the candidate translation and the reference translation, the primary meanings are preserved. "neither" is translated as "sie" instead of "beide", and while "Arbeitsplätze" and "Jobs" are different, they are contextually equivalent. Overall, the candidate translation accurately conveys the source meaning, complying with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Sie sollten dann auch besser bezahlt werden, wie Clinton fordert." closely matches the reference translation "Die sollen dann auch besser bezahlt werden, fordert etwa Clinton." The differences, such as "wie" instead of "etwa" for translating "demands" by Clinton, do not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence, and both are acceptable variations. Therefore, no significant single-word errors are detected.
pittance → Almosen → Hungerlohn  		**Explanation:** "Almosen" translates to "alms" or "charity," which isn't directly synonymous with "pittance" in the economic context of a wage being insufficient. The reference indicates "Hungerlohn," meaning "starvation wage," aligns more closely with the intended meaning, thus following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Sie will sie auf 15 Dollar pro Stunde anheben" accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although "anheben" (raise) and "erhöhen" (increase) are different verbs, both are valid translations in this context. The pronoun "sie" might be used differently than "ihn" in the reference, but it does not change the significant meaning in this sentence and respects the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	betrag → Betrag → verändert  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump." "Trump" is an individual's name and should not be translated or altered, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Betrag" (amount) is not a suitable translation in the context of "stay the same" regarding the minimum wage, whereas "verändert" (changed) provides the correct sense in context. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by altering the sentence's meaning about the action on the minimum wage.
No translation errors detected.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump". "Trumpf" refers to "trump card" in German, which does not fit the context of referring to an individual's name. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as names should be properly translated without alteration in meanings.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation, "behaupten" and "halten ihm vor" both convey the notion of stating or asserting, appropriate for "state". The rest of the sentence maintains the intended meaning without introducing significant errors. The phrase "increase the budgetary deficit" is appropriately translated as "würde das Haushaltsdefizit nur erhöhen", aligning closely with the reference. Therefore, there are no single-word translation errors that significantly alter the meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essence and meaning of the source sentence well. While there may be some variations in phrasing compared to the reference translation, there are no significant single-word mistranslations that alter the meaning or context of the original sentence as per the instructions provided.
refuge → Zuflucht → Flucht  	refugee → Flüchtlingsfrau → geflüchtete Frau  	dealt with → zu tun → Erfahrungen mit  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Zuflucht" (shelter) is a mistranslation of "refuge" in the context of "Flucht" (flight/escape), following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Flüchtlingsfrau" (refugee woman) is mistranslated from "refugee" and is better translated as "geflüchtete Frau" to match the context, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	3. "zu tun" (to do) does not accurately convey the meaning of "dealt with" in the context, where "Erfahrungen mit" (experiences with) is more appropriate, considering the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** guideline.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Für Frauen, die aus einem Land fliehen, ist sexuelle Gewalt fast Teil des täglichen Lebens." conveys the same meaning as the reference. The differences in wording do not alter the sentence's essential meaning, and both versions correctly reflect the source sentence's intended message.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "werden" (are) instead of "sind" (are), but in this context, it conveys the same meaning and does not significantly change the understanding of the sentence. Therefore, no errors are reported following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Ein Haus bietet Zuflucht" matches the reference translation exactly, meaning there are no words that significantly change the meaning or context of the source sentence, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Vier Frauen sitzen in einer großen Küche." accurately translates the source sentence "Four women are sitting in a large kitchen." into German. The order of the elements in the sentence does not affect the meaning, as German syntax is flexible in this context. Therefore, there are no significant single-word translation errors per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Jeder von ihnen hat ein Kind mit ihnen," which maintains the general meaning of "Every one of them has a baby with them." The differences in phrasing do not significantly alter the meaning. "das älteste davon ist ein Jahr alt" similarly conveys the essential information about the child being one year old. The variations in word choice between "Kind" (child) and "Baby" (baby), or "mit ihnen" (with them) and "dabei" (with), do not constitute significant errors as they do not change the overall meaning in a way that violates the instructions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Eine Frau hält ihren kleinen Sohn in den Armen" conveys the same meaning as the source sentence "One woman holds her little son in her arms." While the reference translation uses "eine hat ihren kleinen Sohn in den Arm gelegt," the main point of the sentence is preserved. "Hält" (holds) in the candidate translation maintains the intended meaning despite the different phrasing between the candidate and reference sentences. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule as the candidate does not alter the sentence's original meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While there are differences in word choice between the candidate and reference translations, both effectively convey the same meaning. "inquisitiv" aligns with "neugierig" (curious), and "sich umschauen" aligns with "gucken", both appropriate translations in this context. As the meaning remains intact and no word is demonstrably incorrect, no mistranslation is reported.
stares → steht → starrt  	tabletop → Tisch → Tischplatte  		**Explanation:** "steht" (stands) is a mistranslation of "stares", significantly changing the meaning from observing to standing, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Tisch" (table) is a mistranslation of "tabletop", affecting the specific focus of the stare, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule since the focus shifts from a specific area to the whole table.
realises → weiß → merkt  		**Explanation:** "weißt" (knows) is a mistranslation of "realises," which has a different nuance in the context of becoming aware of being watched. The translation should have used "merkt" to capture the intended meaning of "realises." This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since it changes the aspect of awareness in the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "das Kind" and "den Kleinen" correctly translate "the child." The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules. There's no significant change in meaning or context, so no translation errors are detected.
scene → Szenario → Szene  		**Explanation:** "Szenario" (scenario) is a mistranslation of "scene". While they can be synonyms in some contexts, in this particular sentence, the reference translation uses "Szene" to match the correct meaning of "scene," which slightly changes the context in the candidate translation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Bis Sie anfangen, mit Katrin Bahr zu sprechen" and the reference "Bis man mit Katrin Bahr spricht" both convey the intended meaning from the source sentence. The use of "Sie anfangen" versus "man spricht" does not significantly alter the meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Condrobs → Condros → Condrobs  	provider → Anbieter → Träger  	refugee women → Frauen → Frauen auf der Flucht  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Condros" is a mistranslation of the proper noun "Condrobs" as it is incorrectly transformed and should remain the same. This fits the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Anbieter" (provider) though similar, contextually does not fully capture the institutional nature implied by "Träger" (which is more like 'carrier' or 'institution'), particularly within the context of social assistance. Hence it violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by changing the nuanced implication.	3. "Frauen" (women) omits the specific context "auf der Flucht" (refugee women) from the source, which significantly changes the issue described, violating **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Flüchtlinge", which is a valid synonym for "Geflüchtete" in German and conveys the same meaning as "refugees" in English. Hence, this follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where both terms are acceptable translations in this context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference translation. Both “Unterbringungszentren” and “Unterkünften” refer to accommodation centers and are contextually appropriate. While the phrasing differs slightly in the candidate and reference translations, the translations maintain the intended meaning and no single-word mistranslation significantly alters the meaning or context of the sentence.
Condrobs → Kondrom → Condrobs  	centre → Zentrum → Einrichtung  	Women's → München → Frauenhilfe  		**Explanation:** "Kondrom" is a mistranslation of "Condrobs". It is a name and should remain consistent with the source. "Zentrum" (centre) is a translation error for "Einrichtung" (facility) given the context. "München" (Munich) incorrectly replaces "Women's" when referring to the correct name of the organisation, which should be "Frauenhilfe". These errors significantly change the meaning and context, therefore they are reported.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. "Vor kurzem" and "unlängst" are synonymous in this context, both meaning "recently." No significant mistranslations are identified that would change the intended meaning or violate the given instructions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "Menschen" (people) and "Personen" (persons) are both acceptable translations for "people" in this context. "Ungefähr" (approximately) and "etwa" (about) are near-synonyms, making them both suitable translations for "around". The meanings remain unchanged, so no errors are reported, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The phrase "Es gibt keine Männer, nicht einmal männliche Besucher" in German aligns with the English sentence "There are no men - not even male visitors." Although the structure differs from the reference, it remains a valid translation. Hence, no meaningful errors are detected. This complies with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
exception → Schurken → Ausnahme	bodyguard → Schurken → Wachmann		**Explanation:** "Schurken" (rogue) is a mistranslation both for "exception" and "bodyguard". In the context of the sentence, "Schurken" does not fit the intended meanings. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The correct translations should be "Ausnahme" for "exception" and "Wachmann" for "bodyguard".
sexual → sexuelle → sexueller  	dealt → behandelt → Erfahrungen  		**Explanation:** "Sexuelle Gewalt" (sexual violence) is a correct phrase in this context, so it doesn't need correction; my mistake identifying this error originally. However, "behandelt" (treated/handled) is a mistranslation of "dealt" in this context; it should be understood as "Erfahrungen gemacht" (experienced), according to the reference. Therefore, the correct identification should solely focus on the equivalent meaning from the candidate to reference translation. No issues, therefore none detected – my apologies for the incorrect entry with sexual.
war → Krieg → Kriegen  	hope → Hoffnungen → Hoffnungsträger  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Krieg" (war) is singular in the candidate translation, whereas "Kriegen" (wars) in the reference is plural. The source sentence uses "war" in a collective sense, which aligns more closely with "Kriegen" in German, reflecting multiple conflicts. This affects the meaning contextually, making it a significant error under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.		2. "Hoffnungen" (hopes) is a mistranslation of "Hoffnungsträger" (bearers of hope) in the reference. The concept in the source implies the men are seen as bearers of hope for their families; merely translating to "hopes" loses this nuance, making it a significant error under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
women → Frauen → Frauen  	flee → fliehen → Flucht  	foreground → Vordergrund → überwiegen  	sneak away → schleichen → stehlen sich  		**Explanation:**  	1. "flee" is translated as "fliehen" in the candidate, however, the correct context in German is "Flucht" (flight), indicating the act or process rather than the action itself.	2. "foreground" is translated as "Vordergrund" in the candidate, but the appropriate term in the context of reasons taking precedence is "überwiegen" (prevail).	3. "sneak away" is translated as "schleichen" in the candidate, but the reference provides "stehlen sich" which better conveys the idea of slipping away quietly. 		Words like "women" are correctly translated, hence they are not identified as errors.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:**  	- "Heimatländern" and "Heimat" are both acceptable translations for "home countries." The slight variation does not significantly alter meaning.	- "Zwangsheirat" and "Zwangsehen" both correctly translate "forced marriage."	- The corresponding terms for "sexual violence," "honour killings," "slavery," and "forced prostitution" are accurately translated.	- Both sentences maintain the overall meaning and context, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "bringt voran" and "treibt fort" correctly convey the idea of propelling forward. Given the acceptable variation and preserved meaning, there is no significant mistranslation according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Und es geht weiter, obwohl sie unterwegs sind" effectively captures the meaning of the source sentence "And it continues even while they're on the run." The difference in phrasing from the reference "Auf der Flucht geht das weiter" does not constitute a significant change in meaning, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Both translations convey that something continues while they are in motion, which is the core message of the source sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words in the candidate translation are in accordance with the source and reference sentences. The use of "Menschenhändler" for "traffickers" and the translation of "sexual act" as "sexuellen Akt" are contextually suitable and align with the meaning of the source text. Although there are differences in phrasing and word arrangement, none of these change the meaning in a significant way. Thus, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no errors are reported.
woman → Frau → Frauen  	are → ist → sind  		**Explanation:** "Frau" (woman) is a mistranslation of "women", which changes the intended meaning as it refers to multiple women. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "ist" (is) is a mistranslation of "are", which also changes the intended number and subject agreement, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as well.
thinking → denken → glaube	stops → aufhört → ende	says → sagen → erzählt		**Explanation:**		1. "denken" in the candidate translation is a mistranslation of "think" in the source sentence. The reference uses "glaube," which fits better in this formal reported speech context.	   	2. "aufhört" in the candidate sentence translates to "stops," which is too informal or direct given the context. The reference uses "ende," which is more appropriate for this narrative style.		3. "sagen" in the candidate sentence translates directly to "says," while the reference uses "erzählt," which, given the narrative nature of the sentence, conveys the meaning more accurately.
lone → alleinerziehende → alleinstehende  	accommodation → Unterbringung → Unterkünften  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Alleinerziehende" (single parent) is a mistranslation of "lone" (alone), which shifts the focus from women without partners to those with children, which is not the intended meaning in this context. This change significantly alters the demographic being described, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	   	2. "Unterbringung" (accommodation) in the context of general placement does not accurately convey the concept of "Flüchtlingsunterkünften" (refugee accommodations). "Unterkünften" (accommodations) provides the specific meaning of facilities or shelters used in this context, in accordance with the intended specificity, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While there are some structural and stylistic differences compared to the reference translation, such as the omission of "schätzt sie" ("she estimates"), those do not count as single-word errors and do not significantly alter the meaning or context of the translated sentence. The **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** instructions confirm the absence of meaningful mistranslations.
consent → Zustimmung → freiwillig  	conceived → konzeptiert → entstanden  		**Explanation:** "Zustimmung" (consent) in the candidate translation is aligned with "consent" in the source, but the reference uses "freiwillig" (voluntarily), which fits better with the context of "consent" in a sensitive context like this. "konzeptiert" (conceptualized) is not the correct verb for expressing "conceived" in this context, where "entstanden" (originated) is typically used when referring to the conception of children.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation faithfully conveys the meaning of the source sentence, aligning well with the reference translation. While the structures differ slightly, the essential meaning remains intact. The key words are effectively translated, and there are no significant errors in meaning according to the outlined rules.
can't bring themselves → können sich nicht → trauen sich nicht  	to talk about → zu schämen → zu sprechen  		**Explanation:** The phrase "can't bring themselves" is mistranslated as "können sich nicht", which does not capture the nuance of being unable due to internal reluctance or fear, as "trauten sich nicht" does. Additionally, "zu schämen" (to be ashamed) is incorrectly used instead of "zu sprechen" (to speak), which alters the intended meaning of discussing the experience.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation's use of "mehr Unterkünfte nur für sie geben" and "sagt Bahr" aligns well with the source and the reference meaning. The minor differences in wording ("sollen" vs. "wüssten" and "muss es" vs. "brauche es") do not significantly alter the overall meaning or context, thus following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "verantwortlich" as a translation for "responsible for," which is an acceptable and commonly used synonym in this context. The meaning remains intact, so according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no error is reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the meaning of the source sentence adequately, with no significant single-word translation errors detected compared to the reference translation. The phrases used in both the candidate and reference translations maintain the original intent and meaning.
1. Upper Palatinate → oberen palatilen → Oberpfalz  	2. Upper Franconia → oberfranzösischen → Oberfranken  		**Explanation:**  	- "oberen palatilen" is a mistranslation and does not convey the specific region "Oberpfalz" (Upper Palatinate). This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it misidentifies a specific geographical region.	- "oberfranzösischen" is a mistranslation of "Upper Franconia", not translating to "Oberfranken". This also violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by incorrectly identifying a specific geographical region.
Pressesprecherin → Pressesprecher → Pressesprecher		**Explanation:** "Pressesprecherin" translates to "press spokesperson" in the feminine form, whereas in both the source and the reference, "Karl-Heinz Meyer" is indicated to be male. "Pressesprecher" is the correct term in this context. This addresses the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by correctly reflecting the gendered term used.
Upper → Oberbayern → Oberbayern  	Lower Franconia → Niederflankien → Unterfranken  	Middle Franconia → Nahen Frankreich → Mittelfranken  	lone → alleinerziehende → alleinstehende  	floors → Blumen → Stockwerke  		**Explanation:**		1. "Upper" is correctly translated to "Oberbayern," so there is no error here for the specific term "Upper."	2. "Lower Franconia" is mistranslated as "Niederflankien," which does not refer to a real place. The correct translation is "Unterfranken."	3. "Middle Franconia" is mistranslated as "Nahen Frankreich" which incorrectly includes "Nahen Frankreich" (Near France), while it should be "Mittelfranken."	4. "Lone" is translated as "alleinerziehende" (single parents instead of alone), whereas "alleinstehende" is more contextually appropriate for "lone women."	5. "Floors" is mistranslated as "Blumen" (flowers) rather than "Stockwerke," which changes the meaning of the facilities provided.
**(accommodation → Unterkunftszentren → Unterkünfte)**		**Explanation:** "Unterkunftszentren" (accommodation centers) is a mistranslation of "accommodation" in this context. The source and reference refer to "Unterkünfte" (accommodations), which accurately captures the intended meaning without implying a specific type of center. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by identifying a single word that is contextually inaccurate.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The variations in wording, such as "selbst" (even) versus "auch" (also) or different structures like "betont" (stresses) versus "fordert" (demands), do not significantly alter the core meaning of the translation, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same essential meaning as the source sentence and aligns well with the reference translation. While there might be differences in phrasing between the candidate and reference sentences, these do not constitute significant errors that alter the meaning of the sentence. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
perpetual → ewig → fortwährender  		**Explanation:** "ewig" (eternal) is a mistranslation of "perpetual" in this context. "Fortwährender" (continuing) is the more accurate reference for "perpetual" as it implies ongoing or constant violence rather than eternal. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by suggesting an incorrect degree of violence's duration.
Washing facilities → Waschanlagen → Waschräume  		**Explanation:** "Waschanlagen" (washing plants) is a mistranslation of "washing facilities" in this context, where the intended meaning is more closely aligned with "Waschräume" (washing rooms). This is a significant error as it affects the understanding of the type of facilities being discussed, hence it falls under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the essential meaning of the source sentence. The variations in wording between the candidate and the reference translations, such as "Vielzahl von Menschen" vs. "Andrang," both effectively convey the meaning of a large number of people. No single-word mistranslation significantly alters the intended meaning, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
word → Wort → sich		**Explanation:** "Wort" (word) is a mistranslation of "sich" (a reflexive pronoun in the context of "word has gotten around", which correctly translates to "sich herumgesprochen hat"). The candidate translation incorrectly uses "Wort", which doesn't convey the intended idiomatic meaning of the phrase.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Es wäre leicht, ein zweites Haus zu eröffnen." conveys the same intended meaning as the source sentence "It would be easy to open a second house." Differences in verb choices "eröffnen" (to open) and "aufmachen" (to open) are acceptable variations that do not significantly alter the sentence's meaning, respecting the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
junior → junger → Assistenzärzte  	industrial → industriellen → Arbeitskampf  		**Explanation:**  	- The word "junior" was mistranslated as "junger" (young), which does not properly convey the term "junior doctors" that refers to "Assistenzärzte" (assistant doctors), making it an error under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.  	- The word "industrial" translated as "industriellen" does not fit the context of industrial actions such as strikes, which are better represented by "Arbeitskampf" (industrial action measures), showcasing a case of the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Representatives → Vertreter → Stellvertreter  	junior doctors → Ärzten in der Ausbildung → Assistenzärzte  	industrial → Arbeitsklagen → Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen  		**Explanation:**  	"Vertreter" (representatives) should be "Stellvertreter" in reference to delegates or substitutes, as per the context of the junior doctors' representatives. "Ärzte in der Ausbildung" (doctors in training) is less precise than "Assistenzärzte" (junior doctors/resident doctors) which is the correct specific term. "Arbeitsklagen" (work lawsuits) is a mistranslation of "industrial action", which should be "Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen" referring to organized labor action or strikes. These errors pertain to significant differences in meaning, impacting the interpretation of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In the candidate sentence, "industrielle Maßnahmen" (industrial measures) is close in meaning to "Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen" (industrial action). The translation maintains the intended meaning of industrial action, and therefore, no significant single-word translation errors are detected when compared to the reference. This aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as the meaning conveyed is consistent.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the overall meaning of the source sentence accurately. While there are some stylistic and tense differences between the candidate and the reference translations ("says" vs. "sagte aus", "address" vs. "angesprochen haben"), they do not significantly change the meaning in the context. The syntax and vocabulary choice in the candidate translation are appropriate and contextually accurate, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
junior doctors → Junge Ärzte → Assistenzärzte  	medical students → Mediziner → Medizinstudenten  	contract deal → Vertragsvereinbarung → Vertrag  		**Explanation:**  	- "Junge Ärzte" (young doctors) is a mistranslation of "junior doctors" and should specifically refer to "Assistenzärzte" (residents or junior doctors, not just young).	- "Mediziner" (medical professionals) is a mistranslation for "medical students," which is more accurately reflected in "Medizinstudenten".	- "Vertragsvereinbarung" (contract agreement) adds an unnecessary redundancy compared to "Vertrag" (contract), which more closely matches the reference. This creates a subtle but meaningful shift in the specificity of the contract being discussed.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. The main elements, such as the percentage, rejection, and the act of voting by members, are preserved without significant changes to the sentence's meaning. The variations seen in wording are acceptable as they maintain the overall context and intent of the original text. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
members → Mitglieder → Mitglieder	night → abend → abend	persistently → ständig → beharrlich  	silent → still → ruhig  		**Explanation:** Here, "ständig" (constantly) is a mistranslation of "persistently", which should be "beharrlich". This significantly changes the nuance of the criticism towards the government. "still" (quiet/silent) does not capture the nuance of "ruhig" (calm or quiet in the sense of not responding), particularly in the context of government inaction. The other words, "members" → "Mitglieder" and "night" → "abend", are correctly translated and thus do not constitute errors.
1. Executive → Exekutive → Vorstand		**Explanation:** "Exekutive" is a literal translation of "Executive" but in this context, "Board" ("Vorstand") is more appropriate, referring specifically to the governing body of the JDC.		2. formal → förmlichen → offizielle		**Explanation:** While "förmlichen" (formal) could be seen as interchangeable with "offizielle" (official), the latter is more accurately aligned with the context of "formal re-negotiations" in terms of diplomatic language used in business or legal contexts.		3. concerns → Anliegen → Sorgen		**Explanation:** "Anliegen" (concerns/issues) can be considered similar to "Sorgen" (concerns/worries), but "Sorgen" captures a more personal or pressing sense of concern, aligning with the phrase "all of your concerns" more closely in the given context.
government's → Regierung → der Regierung	exec → Exec → Vorstand	formal → offiziell → formalen	special → Sondersitzung → spezielles	meeting → Sondersitzung → Treffen	rolling → Rollprogramm → laufendes	industrial action → Industriemaßnahmen → Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen		**Explanation:**  	- "Exec" (Exec) should be "Vorstand" (board), aligning with common organizational terms, thus following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Offiziell" (official) is a mistranslation here as it pertains to the request, which should be "formalen" (formal).	- "Sondersitzung" (special session) suggests a meeting but carries a specific connotation inappropriate here when compared to "Treffen" (meeting).	- "Rollprogramm" (rolling program) does not capture the continuity implied by "laufendes" (ongoing). 	- "Industriemaßnahmen" (industrial measures) fails to convey the nuance of "Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen" (industrial action), important to maintain under **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.
junior doctors → Ärzte in der Ausbildung → Assistenzärzte	all-out stoppages → Auslaufverbote → Gesamtausfälle		**Explanation:** "Ärzte in der Ausbildung" (doctors in training) is a less precise translation of "junior doctors." It doesn't capture the specific context of "Assistenzärzte" (resident doctors) used in reference to the NHS. "Auslaufverbote" (run-out bans) is a mistranslation of "all-out stoppages," which significantly alters the meaning of the sentence, as it doesn't convey the complete cessation of work.
junior → junge → Assistenzärzte  	vote → Abstimmung → Wahl  	negotiate → ablehnen → vereinbarten  		**Explanation:** 	- "junge" (young) is a mistranslation of "junior", which in this context refers to "Assistenzärzte" (junior doctors) rather than the age of the leader.	- "Abstimmung" (vote) translates more as a general form of voting, while "Wahl" represents the election-focused context used here. In this context, the specific term used in the reference translation more accurately reflects the intended meaning.	- "ablehnen" (to reject) is incorrectly used as the translation of "negoitated" because it changes the nature of the action taken regarding the contract. The reference sentence uses "vereinbarten" (negotiated) reflecting the process of coming to an agreement, not the act of rejection.
members → Ärzten → Mitgliedern  	poll → Umfrage → Abstimmung  	junior → Ärzten → Assistenzärzte  	medical students → Ärzten → Medizinstudenten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Mitgliedern" (members) is translated as "Ärzten" (doctors), which changes the meaning significantly. The original sentence refers to members of an organization, not specifically doctors.	2. "Abstimmung" (poll) is translated as "Umfrage" (survey), changing the context of the voting process involved in the decision.	3. "Assistenzärzte" (junior doctors) is mistranslated as "Ärzten" (doctors), losing the nuance of their level or position.	4. "Medizinstudenten" (medical students) is inaccurately translated as "Ärzten" (doctors), which misrepresents their role and status.
vote → Abstimmung → Wahl	medics → Arzneimitteln → Ärzte		**Explanation:** "Abstimmung" can mean a vote or a poll, but "Wahl" is more contextually accurate in terms of elections or formal votes, which suits the scenario better. "Arzneimitteln" (medicines/drugs) is a mistranslation of "medics," which refers to medical professionals such as "Ärzte" (doctors) in this context. This significantly alters the intended meaning of the sentence.
misfits → Fehler → Außenseitern		**Explanation:** "Fehler" (errors) is a mistranslation of "misfits", which carries a meaning of being out of place or unconventional in context, not literal mistakes or errors. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it alters the intended nuance of the phrase.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Es war eine Geste, die eine Krise beendet hat" and the reference translation "Es war eine Geste, die eine Krise beendete" both convey the same meaning. The difference between "beendet hat" and "beendete" involves tense aspects, which are contextually acceptable variations. Thus, there are no significant single-word translation errors according to the guidelines provided.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the meaning of the source sentence accurately. The differences in wording, such as "Staats- und Regierungschefs" (leaders) and "Anführer" (leaders), or "hände zu schütteln" (shake hands) versus "sich die Hände zu geben" (give hands), are stylistic choices and do not significantly alter the meaning. Therefore, these do not qualify as translation errors. The meaning regarding the timeframe, the end of hostilities, and economic sanctions remains intact.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essential meaning of the source sentence. While there are differences in phrase structure and word choice compared to the reference translation, none of these differences result in significant changes in meaning or contextual inaccuracy. According to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** instructions, variations that do not alter the message's core meaning are considered acceptable.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation has different word order but does not significantly change the meaning. Both translations convey the idea that there was a handshake, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Putin's → Putin → Putins  	smile → gelächelt → Lächeln  	thin → gelächelt → schmallippig  	oozing → gewalzt → aus  	warmth → Wärme → Wärme  	restrained → maßvollen → zurückhaltenden  		**Explanation:**  		1. **Putin's → Putin → Putins:** The candidate translation incorrectly uses "Putin" instead of "Putins," which means "Putin's" in German, affecting possession.		2. **smile → gelächelt → Lächeln:** "gelächelt" means "smiled," while the source "smile" refers to the noun "Lächeln."		3. **thin → gelächelt → schmallippig:** The phrase "thin smile" is mistranslated as "gelächelt" (smiled) instead of "schmallippig" (thin/narrow), which changes the intended nuance regarding the nature of the smile.		4. **oozing → gewalzt → aus:** "gewalzt" (rolled) does not convey the same meaning as "oozing" (ausstrahlen/aus), which refers to emitting warmth in this context.		5. **warmth → Wärme → Wärme:** Although "Wärme" is correct, the surrounding mistranslation with "oozing" affects its contextual accuracy.		6. **restrained → maßvollen → zurückhaltenden:** "maßvollen" means "moderate," while "restrained" contextually means "zurückhaltenden" (reserved/restrained), impacting the intended meaning of the sentence.
(Recep → Reif → Recep)  	(Tayyip → Tayip → Tayyip)  		**Explanation:** There are clear mistranslations of the names "Recep" and "Tayyip". "Reif" and "Tayip" are incorrect for the given context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as names should be accurately preserved to maintain meaning and relevance. All other words and phrases are accurately translated, with no significant errors impacting the overall meaning.
count → verloren → zählen		**Explanation:** "verloren" (lost) is used in a context that implies something was physically lost, which changes the intended idiomatic meaning of "lost count". The key aspect here is the concept of counting, which is properly represented by "zählen" in the reference translation. The candidate translation omits this understanding, missing the idiomatic expression present in the source sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the meaning of the source sentence. While there are slight differences in phrasing, such as "auf ihr Niveau" versus "zu ihrem alten Niveau", these do not constitute mistranslations as the overall meaning remains consistent. Thus, there are no significant single-word errors according to the guidelines.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation adequately maintains the key points and meaning of the source sentence. The choice of words like "beschrieb" (described) and "etwas Schlechtes" (something bad) sufficiently matches the intended meaning of the source, as does the handling of Mr. Erdogan's actions being described. While there are stylistic differences between the candidate and reference, such as "etwas Schlechtes" versus "etwas Schlimmes," these do not constitute meaningful changes to the core meaning. Hence, no mistranslations are identified based on the instructions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although the candidate translation uses "bedeutete" (meant) instead of "anzudeuten" (imply), in this context, both convey the essential meaning of the sentence where enthusiasm indicates the opposite. This fits under the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, as the perceived meaning is preserved.
coolness → Feigheit → Kühle  	emanating → langweilige → ausstrahlende  		**Explanation:** "Feigheit" (cowardice) is a mistranslation of "coolness", which is a significant change in meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it mischaracterizes Mr. Putin's demeanor. "langweilige" (boring) is a mistranslation of "emanating", which has a meaningful difference, impacting the sentence's imagery and intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While "in fact" is translated as "vielmehr" in the reference, the candidate omits it, which does not significantly change the meaning. The rest of the sentence matches well with the reference translation. Therefore, in accordance with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, no significant single-word errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Moskau reagierte damals wütend" conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. "Moskau" (Moscow) and "reagierte" (reacted) appropriately convey "Moscow's reaction," "damals" (at the time) aligns with "zu der Zeit," and "wütend" (furious) is a valid, slightly less intense synonym for "wutentbrannt" in this context. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, indicating no significant translation errors.
lashed → niedergeschlagen → teilte   	Moscow → Moskau → Russland  		**Explanation:** "niedergeschlagen" (depressed) is a mistranslation of "lashed"; it changes the action's nature incorrectly. The reference uses "teilte aus," which better conveys the aggressive nature intended here. Additionally, "Moskau" (Moscow) should correctly be "Russland" (Russia) in this context, as it refers to the nation rather than just the city, aligning with **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
offence → Straftat → Vergehen  		**Explanation:** "Straftat" (criminal offense) is a mistranslation of "offence" in this context where it implies a wrongdoing or insult, aligning more with "Vergehen" (misdemeanor/offense), per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Other elements retain their meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate "Der Aufbau eines echten Vertrauens" (The building of real trust) captures the essence of "Rebuilding real trust" and "ist schwierig, vielleicht unmöglich" (is hard, perhaps impossible) aligns well with the intended meaning of "will be hard, perhaps impossible." The variations are within acceptable limits, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as the meaning of the sentence is maintained without significant distortion.
public opinion → Öffentlichkeit → öffentliche Meinung  	turned → zurückgekehrt → gewandelt  		**Explanation:** "Öffentlichkeit" (public) is a mistranslation of "public opinion," where "öffentliche Meinung" (public opinion) captures the intended meaning. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "zurückgekehrt" (returned) is a mistranslation of "turned" in the context that means "changed or shifted," where "gewandelt" is the correct translation. This violation also follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since the meaning significantly shifts from the intended sense of change in opinion.
state-controlled → staatlich kontrollierte → die staatlich kontrollierten  	months → Monatelang → Monate lang  	staggering → erschütternde → heftigen  	all-out → scharfe → uneingeschränkten  	offensive → Offensive → Angriff  		**Explanation:**  	- "staatlich kontrollierte" is not preceded by "die," potentially affecting the grammatical structure compared to the reference.	- "Monatelang" (for months) is a general expression, but the two-word form "Monate lang" more closely matches the reference.	- "erschütternde" (staggering) does not fully convey the intensity of "heftigen" from the reference, which better aligns with "staggering" as intended.	- "scharfe" (sharp) implies a different nature of "offensive" than "uneingeschränkten" (all-out or unrestricted), thus altering the intended meaning.	- "Offensive" (offensive) and "Angriff" (attack) are different translations; "Angriff" may better encompass the forcefulness implied by "offensive" in this context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The phrase "verantwortlich seien" is a valid alternative for "die Schuld tragen". Both convey the idea of being blamed or held responsible, which follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, no mistranslation significantly alters the meaning.
accusations → Vorwürfe → Anschuldigungen		**Explanation:** "Vorwürfe" (accusations) versus "Anschuldigungen" (accusations/charges): While both "Vorwürfe" and "Anschuldigungen" can refer to accusations, "Anschuldigungen" is more directly aligned with formal accusations or charges, making it a closer semantic match in this legal and serious context according to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule. Thus, in this context, "Vorwürfe" is identified as a mistranslation as it lacks the formal connotation intended by "Anschuldigungen".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "ausdrücklich geleugnet" is a valid alternative to "vehement bestritten" for "denied that emphatically" given the context. Both convey a strong denial, so no significant meaning change occurs. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "offiziell gesagt" (officially said) and "voranzuschreiten" (to move forward), both of which convey similar meanings to "lautete die offizielle Botschaft" (the official message was) and "nach vorne zu blicken" (to look forward) in the reference. Although the phrasing differs, the meaning of the sentence is preserved, and no significant single-word mistranslations are present.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation communicates the same meaning as the source sentence. The phrase differences like "geschah" vs. "fand statt" both appropriately translate "happened" or "took place," and do not change the overall meaning. Similarly, "geforderte Entschuldigung" vs. "Entschuldigung, die er hören wollte" are variations of "apology he demanded." Thus, no significant errors in meaning are detected.
could → könnte → konnte  	claim → fordern → verbuchen  		**Explanation:** "könnte" (could) is used in a conditional sense, but "konnte" (could) implies past capability or possibility. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the tense and mood differ. "fordern" (demand) significantly changes the meaning from "claim" (a reporting or recognizing sense), violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "verbuchen" (to record or achieve) aligns better with "claim" in this context.
calling → Berufung → Vorteile eines  		**Explanation:** The term "Berufung" (appeal) is a mistranslation of "calling", which in this context refers to initiating a truce, not an appeal or invocation. The phrase "Vorteile eines Waffenstillstands" (benefits of a truce) requires clarity on the initiating action, not invoking an appeal. Thus, "Vorteile eines" is the correct term for the concept of "calling a truce". The mistranslation shifts the meaning significantly, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. The phrases "vor allem" and "in erster Linie" both adequately convey "first and foremost". The rest of the translation accurately reflects the source, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where acceptable variations are not marked as errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and reference translation convey the same meaning, despite minor variations. "Auch" and "ebenfalls" both convey the idea of "also" or "too," and "deutlich" maintains the sense of "clearly" from the source without altering the intended message. Therefore, there are no significant errors according to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Es gibt auch ein wirtschaftliches Motiv" accurately reflects the meaning of the source sentence "There is also an economic motive." Although there is a number difference ("Motive" vs. "Motiv") between the candidate and reference, the candidate translation remains correct and contextually accurate. Thus, according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, no significant translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The phrase "haben hart getroffen" captures "have hit hard," and the rest of the sentence preserves the intended meaning. The differences between "jährlich" and "jedes Jahr" (both mean "each year") or the omission of "die Türkei" do not constitute meaningful errors in this context. Therefore, following the rules, there are no significant single-word mistranslations to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "Zahl" (number) and "Anzahl" (amount/number) are both valid translations for "number". "gesunken" (sunk) and "zurückgegangen" (declined) convey similar meanings regarding a decrease, fitting the context. Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, there are no significant errors to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the meaning of the source sentence accurately. The structure and choice of words align well with the reference translation, without any single-word errors that change the sentence's meaning. The phrase "As for Russia" is translated to "Was Russland betrifft," which, although different from the reference "In Russland," accurately captures the context and intent, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, no mistranslations are present.
They → Sie → Sie		banking → banken → zählen		No translation errors detected. 		Mediterranean → Mittelmeer → Mittelmeer		**Explanation:** Although "Sie" is correctly translated, the word "banken" is incorrect as it directly translates the English verb "bank", which in context means "rely on" or "count on". The correct German term in this idiomatic usage is "zählen". Additionally, "Mediterranean" is correctly translated as "Mittelmeer" in both candidate and reference sentences. The source and reference translations use similar words that are contextually accurate in terms of geographical reference, thus conforming to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.
Tourists → Touristen → Touristen  	that way → auf diese Weise → dort lang  	back → zurück → hier lang  		**Explanation:**  	- "Touristen" is correctly translated, so it is not listed as an error.	- "that way" is mistranslated as "auf diese Weise" (in this way), which changes the intended directional meaning to "dort lang" (that way), violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.	- "back" is mistranslated as "zurück" (back), instead of the contextual meaning "hier lang" (here), which changes the intended location reference, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately mirrors the source sentence. The inclusion of "auch" (also) does not alter the conveyed meaning materially when compared to the reference translation. Therefore, no significant single-word mistranslation is present, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the source and reference sentences. The word choice and structure in the candidate sentence maintain the intended meaning, and there are no significant changes in meaning due to mistranslations.
long-standing → Schneckentempo → anhaltende  	talks → Schneckentempos → Beitrittsverhandlungen  	step → verschwenden → verringern  	chip → in die Schnecke treibt → zu verringern  		**Explanation:**  	- "Schneckentempo" (snail's pace) as a translation of "long-standing" is a clear error, as it changes the meaning entirely from a duration to a speed descriptor.	- "Schneckentempos" (snail's pace) as a mistranslation of "talks" misrepresents the subject entirely. The intended meaning refers to EU membership negotiations.	- "verschwenden" (waste) does not convey the meaning of "step in", which involves actively leveraging or taking action on a situation, thus altering the intent.	- "in die Schnecke treibt" (drive into the snail) is confusing and does not convey the intended meaning of "chip away". The reference suggests a gradual reduction in relations, which is not captured here.
certainly → sicher → mit Sicherheit  	for calling in → unterstützt → forderte  		**Explanation:**  	- "sicher" (securely) is a mistranslation of "certainly", which should be translated as "mit Sicherheit" in this context to convey the correct degree of certainty. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "unterstützt" (supported) is a mistranslation of "for calling in", which should be translated as "forderte" (called for) to reflect the action of asking for support, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.
summit → Palast → Gipfeltreffen  	glitzy → winkelhaften → glanzvollen  	misfits → Fehler → Außenseitern  		**Explanation:**  	- "Palast" is the translation for "palace," but in the context, "Gipfeltreffen" (summit meeting) is intended to translate "summit."	- "winkelhaften" (angular) is a mistranslation of "glitzy," which is more accurately translated as "glanzvollen" (glamorous).	- "Fehler" (mistakes) is a mistranslation of "misfits," which should be "Außenseitern" (outsiders) in the context described. This error changes the meaning significantly, as it doesn't capture the intended alliance of those who feel rejected.
Still → Trotz → Dennoch  	reconciliation → Aussöhnungsbekundung → Versöhnung  	the two → (missing) → zwischen den beiden  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Still" should be translated as "Dennoch" to capture the contrast at the beginning of the sentence, while "Trotz" alone does not convey this nuance.	2. "reconciliation" is mistranslated as "Aussöhnungsbekundung" (expression of reconciliation), rather than the simpler "Versöhnung," which is more direct and contextually correct.	3. "the two" is missing from the candidate translation, which impacts the understanding that the differences are between two entities.
key → Schlüssel → größte Differenz  	casting → aufgespielt → gab  	back → bilden → unterstützen  		**Explanation:** "Schlüssel" (key) is not equivalent to "größte Differenz" (biggest difference), which alters the intended emphasis. "Aufgespielt" (acted) doesn't convey the intended meaning as well as "gab" (gave/played the role), affecting the nuance. "Bilden" (form/create) is a mistranslation of "back" (support), changing the meaning of the involvement of Russia and Turkey.
(Initial → Anfangs → Erst)	(telling → schon → bezeichnend)	(press → einer → der)  		**Explanation:**  	1. **Initial → Anfangs → Erst:** The candidate translation uses "Anfangsgesprächen" (beginning talks) for "initial talks", whereas "Erstgesprächen" captures the intended meaning of the first or preliminary talks more accurately. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as "Erst" emphasizes the initial nature correctly compared to "Anfangs".	   	2. **telling → schon → bezeichnend:** The word "schon" (already) in the context of "Es kann schon sein" (it may be already) does not capture the subtlety of "telling" as in "indicative" or "significant", for which "bezeichnend" (telling/significant) is more appropriate. This violates the **Contextual Accuracy** rule where the candidate's word choice alters meaning.		3. **press → einer → der:** The candidate uses "einer Pressekonferenz" (a press conference) instead of "der Pressekonferenz" (the press conference), not aligning with the source which refers to a specific known event. This aligns under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as specificity of the "press conference" aligns with a particular instance mentioned.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. The significant words and context, such as "deliberately avoided" and "underline" (hervorhob/betonen), maintain their intended meanings. Possible variations like "türkische Präsident" vs. "Präsident der Türkei" or "bewusst" vs. "absichtlich" do not affect the core semantics as per the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence and aligns well with the reference translation. Although there are some differences in word choice, such as "einigen" (to agree) and "gemeinsamer Nenner" (common ground), these variations do not constitute significant translation errors. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by focusing on the correctness of meaning rather than minor wording differences.
Turkey → Türkei wurde → Türkei abgeschoss 	fighter → wurde → Kampfjet 		**Explanation:** "Türkei wurde" implies Turkey became a NATO member, which misrepresents the sequence of events. The phrase should indicate Turkey's action of shooting down a jet. The word "wurde" (became) is a mistranslation and the actual event involves the shooting, so "abgeschoss" (shot down) is correct. "Wurde" fails to capture this meaning. The intended context of "fighter" as part of "fighter jet" is also not translated correctly, with "wurde" not covering the concept of a jet or combat.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the intended meaning from the source sentence, conveying that the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available or accessible ("verschwindet" aligns with "disappear") for customers outside Scotland. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as both translations maintain the sentence's meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "zu einer Bürofunktion reduziert werden" retains the intended meaning of "reduced to a back office role" as presented in the reference translation. No single-word error significant enough to alter the meaning has been identified. The phrase "nach Aussage des Leiters der Bank" captures the essence of "according to the bank's chief executive" from the source sentence. While there are variations in the choice of words ("Bürofunktion" vs. "Backoffice-Rolle", "Leiter" vs. "Vorstandschef"), these do not result in a meaningful loss or change of context, thus aligning with the task's guidelines.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although "Königliche Bank von Schottland" could be considered a close literal translation of "Royal Bank of Scotland," it does not represent a mistranslation error since "Royal" is commonly associated with "Königliche" in German, and the functional meaning of the sentence remains intact. Additionally, "verschwinden" (disappear) is synonymous with "nicht mehr verfügbar sein" (not be available anymore) in this context. Thus, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no significant translation errors are found.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the original meaning accurately when compared to the reference translation. The variations such as "sagte" (said) and "teilte mit" (informed) as well as the slight structural differences don't significantly alter the meaning or context of the sentence, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While there are differences in structure, the candidate sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The phrase "hat sich von ihnen zurückgezogen" matches the idea of "retreated from them", "vor fast acht Jahren zusammengebrochen ist" aligns with "nearly collapsed eight years ago", and "musste gerettet werden" corresponds to "had to be bailed out". Therefore, there are no significant or incorrect single-word translations that violate the task rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with the source and reference sentences. The words used in the candidate translation accurately convey the meaning of the source sentence. There are no single-word errors that significantly change the meaning, and acceptable variations are present, such as word order and phrasing differences that do not violate the instructions.
Six Nations → sechs NRugby → Six Nations  	champion → Charter → Sieger  		**Explanation:** "sechs NRugby" is a mistranslation of "Six Nations", where "NRugby" appears to be an error. It violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "sechs NRugby" does not accurately represent the recognized name "Six Nations". "Charter" is a mistranslation of "champion", which significantly changes the meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, since "Wimbledon Charter" doesn't convey the intended meaning of Andy Murray as the champion.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essential meaning of the source sentence, and the variations between "eingeschätzt worden" and "dazu entschieden" are acceptable in this context as both convey decision-making, though differently phrased. The rest of the sentence elements align well with the source and reference, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
will be used → wird verwendet → wird verfügbar sein  	initialised → initiiert → initialisiert  		**Explanation:** 	- "wird verwendet" (will be used) is a mistranslation of "will be used" as it should convey availability rather than usage for customers, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "initiiert" (initiated) is incorrect in this context, while "initialisiert" (initialised) correctly translates the intended meaning of setting up or starting a system, according to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** While the structure of the sentences varies, the candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The terms "Hauptzentrums" and "Hauptsitz" both refer contextually to the central office, and "Börsenliste" and "Börsennotierung" both refer to stock exchange listing. The translation maintains the intended meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.
Dummond → Drummond → Drummond		**Explanation:** "Dummond" is a spelling error in the candidate translation for "Drummond" from the source and reference sentences. This meets the **Identify Mistranslations** rule since the incorrect spelling changes the meaning by referring to a non-existent entity. There are no other significant single-word translation errors detected.
interviewed → angehört → interviewt		**Explanation:** "angehört" (listened to/heard) is a mistranslation of "interviewed". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it changes the nature of the activity involving Mr. McEwan. The correct word should convey the precise meaning of being questioned or formally interviewed, which is appropriately translated as "interviewt".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence, with appropriate equivalence in the context of financial terminology and branding. Although there are stylistic differences, such as the preposition usage and sentence structure, these do not significantly change the meaning. Hence, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, no single-word mistranslation errors are identified.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "selbst" and "selber" can be used interchangeably in this context, meaning "itself" in English. The candidate translation does not contain any words that significantly alter the meaning of the sentence compared to the reference translation. Thus, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no errors are reported.
global aspirations → globalen Ambitionen → globalen Ziele  	local aspirations → lokale Bestrebungen → lokale Ziele  		**Explanation:** "Ambitionen" (ambitions) and "Bestrebungen" (strivings) are mistranslations of "aspirations", which refer to "goals" or "aims" in this context. The translations significantly change the subtle meaning intended by the original sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In this context, both "Gemeinschaften" (communities) and "Gemeinden" (communities or municipalities) can be used interchangeably depending on the interpretation. Similarly, "Personal" (staff) and "Mitarbeiter" (employees) convey the same meaning within the context of the sentence. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as both translations adequately preserve the meaning of the source sentence.
stated → erklärt → ausgesagt	six → sechs → Six	profile → Profil → Wahrnehmbarkeit		**Explanation:** "erklärt" (explained) is a mistranslation of "stated", as "ausgesagt" (declared) is more accurate in this context. "sechs" (six) is a mistranslation for "Six" which refers to a specific event name, "Six Nations," not the number six. Lastly, "Profil" (profile) does not correctly capture the intended meaning of "Wahrnehmbarkeit" (visibility), affecting the nuanced context of how brands are being elevated.
chief executive → Chef der Exekutive → Vorstandschef		**Explanation:** "Chef der Exekutive" is a mistranslation of "chief executive." In the context of a corporate setting, "Vorstandschef" is the correct term for referring to the "chief executive." This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Chef der Exekutive" does not accurately convey the intended corporate title.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Es wäre schon vor drei Jahren sehr zynisch gewesen, wenn wir gesagt hätten, wir werden eine große Bank für die Kunden sein und diese Marken dorthin bringen." does not have significant word-level errors when compared to the source and reference sentences. The sentence retains the intended message and context, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules. The subtle differences do not alter the overall meaning significantly.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence, accurately reflecting the emphasis on customer needs over personal interests. The use of "Arbeit", "Bedürfnisse der Kunden", "konzentrieren", and "Veränderungen" aligns well with the reference translation. Any variations between the candidate and reference translations are acceptable and do not signify significant changes in meaning.
bring → hereinholen → lancieren  	right → reif → gekommen  		**Explanation:** "hereinholen" (bring in) is a mistranslation of "bring" in this context, where "lancieren" (launch) is the intended action. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "hereinholen" does not convey the intended meaning of relaunching brands. "reif" (ripe) is a mistranslation of "right" in this context; "gekommen" (come) fits better with "time is right" as in "time has come," which affects the meaning significantly, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
1. winners → Gewinner → Gewinn	2. Newmarket → Newmarkt → Newmarket	3. Predilection → Prädiditionen → Predilection		**Explanation:** 	- "Gewinner" (winners) is used incorrectly in place of "Gewinn" (victory/achievement), significantly changing the meaning from achieving victories to addressing separate winners. This addresses the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** principle.	- "Newmarkt" is a mistranslation of "Newmarket", a proper noun that should remain unchanged to maintain contextual accuracy in places. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Prädiditionen" is not a valid German translation for "Predilection", likely a misspelling or misinterpretation, which misrepresents the name of the horse and violates the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
1. Newmarket → Newmarkt → Newmarket	2. double → Doppelten → Double	3. wins → Gewinner → Gewinn  		**Explanation:**  	- "Newmarkt" is a mistranslation of "Newmarket" as it alters the proper noun, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Doppelten" is a mistranslation of "double" in this context. "Double" in a sporting context refers to achieving two wins or victories, which should be translated as "Double", following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "Gewinner" (winners) is a mistranslation of "wins" in the sense of achievements or victories, needing to be translated as "Gewinn" in this context, which aligns with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
3,000th → 3 000 britischen Gewinner → 3.000ten britischen Gewinn		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "3 000 britischen Gewinner", where "Gewinner" means "winner", which incorrectly translates the notion of his "3,000th win" or "3.000ten Gewinn". The issue lies with both the number format and the word "Gewinner" used in the candidate, which should be "Gewinn" to match the reference's intended meaning of a win or victory.
landmark → Marke → Meilenstein  	winner → Nachtegewinner → Gewinn  	track → Bahn → Rennstrecke  	Predilection → Vorauswahl → Predilection  		**Explanation:**  		- "Marke" (brand) is a mistranslation of "landmark" (Meilenstein), which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence.	- "Nachtegewinner" (night winner) is a mistranslation of "second winner" (Gewinn). The inclusion of "Nacht" implies it was the winner of the night, rather than just a second win.	- "Bahn" (path/route) is a less specific translation that fails to capture the contextually correct "track" related to racing, which should be "Rennstrecke."	- "Vorauswahl" (preselection) incorrectly replaces the proper noun "Predilection" which should remain unchanged as it is a name.
jockey → Schachzug → Jockey  	Flat → Flatrennen → Flachrennen  		**Explanation:** "Schachzug" (chess move) is a mistranslation of "jockey", which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence regarding the profession being discussed. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Flatrennen" is a mistranslation of "Flachrennen". Although "Flat" seems borrowed from English in the candidate, it is not the standard German term for this type of race, which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it alters the intended racing context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although there might be minor variations in the spelling of "Pat Eddery" (Eddry/Eddy), the candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the reference, maintaining the integrity of the list of names. Therefore, according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, no significant mistranslation is detected.
champion → Vorkämpfer → Sieger  	special → das Besondere → etwas Besonderes  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Vorkämpfer" (campaigner/fighter) is a mistranslation of "champion" (in the context of competition, "Sieger" meaning winner is correct). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Vorkämpfer" does not convey the athletic achievement context of a "champion."	2. "das Besondere" (the special thing) mistranslates "special" in this context. In the given sentence, "special" is intended to mean "something special" as noted by "etwas Besonderes" in the reference, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation is a valid translation of the source sentence. The placement of "auch" (also) in the candidate sentence does not significantly alter the meaning or grammatical correctness in German compared to the reference sentence. Therefore, no significant single-word translation errors are apparent according to the given rules.
I'm → Ich freue mich → Ich bin  	pleased → freue mich → glücklich  	it → dies → es  	at → auf dem → bei  	landed → angelandet → gelandet  		**Explanation:**		1. "I'm" translated as "Ich freue mich" instead of "Ich bin." "Ich bin" is more directly correct, closely matching the reference.	2. "pleased" is expressed as "freue mich", whereas "glücklich" captures the intended sentiment closer to "very pleased."	3. "it" is translated as "dies," but the reference accurately uses "es," which is more appropriate for referring to an abstract event.	4. "at" is translated as "auf dem," but "bei" is more contextually fitting for a location name like Newmarket.	5. "landed" is translated as "angelandet." While technically correct, "gelandet" is more contextually appropriate, aligning with the reference.
mundane → tausendjährige → banaler  		**Explanation:** "tausendjährige" (millennial) is a mistranslation of "mundane", which signifies an ordinary situation rather than something related to age or era. This significantly alters the intended meaning and violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Ich bin erleichtert und sehr bescheiden" perfectly matches the reference translation and accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. There are no significant changes in meaning, so no errors according to the given rules.
cheers → Freuden → Jubel  	Predilection → Präsidentschaft → Predilection  		**Explanation:** "Freuden" (joys/happiness) is a mistranslation of "cheers", which significantly alters the context. "Präsidentschaft" (presidency) is a mistranslation of "Predilection", the name that should be carried through untranslated from the source sentence. These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
jockeys → Schachfiguren → Jockeys  	jump racing → Spitzenrennen → Hindernisrennen  	champion → Wagschirm → Jockey  	retired → 20-jähriger → pensionierte  	20-time → Kämpfer → 20-malige  		**Explanation:** 		- "Schachfiguren" (chess pieces) is a mistranslation of "jockeys", which changes the meaning from horse racing to chess.	- "Spitzenrennen" (top races) is a mistranslation of "jump racing", which refers more specifically to a type of horse race.	- "Wagschirm" does not translate as "champion"; it appears to be a nonsensical term in this context instead of correctly referring to "champion" as "Jockey".	- "20-jähriger" (20-year-old) is a mistranslation of "retired", significantly altering the description of Sir Anthony McCoy's status.	- "Kämpfer" (fighter) is a mistranslation of "20-time", incorrectly identifying Sir Anthony McCoy's achievement.
Lester → Leser → Lester  	winner → Gewinner → Derbysieger  	wins → Gewinne → Karrieresiege  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Leser" is a mistranslation of "Lester," likely due to a typographical error. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since it represents a person's name incorrectly.	2. "Gewinner" (winner) should be "Derbysieger" (Derby winner) as per the reference translation to convey the specific achievement related to the Derby. This error violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it generalizes the specific championship.	3. "Gewinne" (gains) does not accurately capture "Karrieresiege" (career wins), which are specific to his victories in races. This affects the sentence's precision, thus following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
jockeys → Jacken → Jockey  	era → Zeit → Moderne  	before → vorgelegt → vor  		**Explanation:**  	- "Jacken" (jackets) is a mistranslation of "jockeys", which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it does not fit the profession being described.	- "Zeit" (time) is a mistranslation of "era", specifically in the context of "modern era," which should be "Moderne." This affects accuracy in describing the timeframe.	- "vorgelegt" (submitted) is a mistranslation of "before," changing the context of who has achieved this in the past.
stylish → stilisch → hat Stil  	nous → Nackt → Intellekt  	weighing → Gewichts → Gewichtskontroll  		**Explanation:**  	1. "stilisch" is a less conventional or incorrect form compared to "hat Stil" (has style), which matches the intended meaning more closely.  	2. "Nackt" (naked) is not an accurate translation of "nous" (intelligence or intellect), which should be "Intellekt" as per the context.  	3. "Gewichts" (weight) does not adequately capture the implied "weighing" or "weight control" associated with "Gewichtskontrollraum" (weighing room) in the context of such settings.
enthusiasm → Begeisterung → Enthusiasmus  	racing → Rasse → Rennen  	fans → den Sport → Fans  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Begeisterung" (enthusiasm) is related to "enthusiasm," but the reference uses "Enthusiasmus," which more closely aligns with the source sentence and is consistent with the provided context.  	2. "Rasse" (race/breed) is a mistranslation of "racing," which refers to the sport, hence "Rennen" is the accurate term. This misunderstanding changes the intended meaning significantly, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.  	3. "den Sport" (the sport) is a mistranslation of "fans," altering the focus from individuals to the sport itself. The difference in meaning highlights an error, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** principle.
said → gepredigt → sagte  	riders → Gewinner → Gewinne  	great move → großartiger Schachzug → Großturnierjockey  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Gepredigt" (preached) is a mistranslation of "said". It doesn't maintain the meaning in the context of the sentence, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Gewinner" (winners) is correct in some contexts but should be "Gewinne" (victories) here, to match with how "rides 6,000 winners" is contextually presented, violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule as it changes the intended emphasis of the achievement.	3. "Großartiger Schachzug" (great move) is a mistranslation of "big-race jockey", significantly altering the meaning and role discussed, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Frankie's → Frankies → Frankie  	riding → gemacht → geritten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Frankies" in the candidate translation introduces an error because it incorrectly uses a possessive form rather than the correct name "Frankie," violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it alters the proper noun's form.	2. "gemacht" (made) is a mistranslation of "riding," which should be "geritten" (ridden). This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, as it changes the activity that Frankie is performing.
character → Charakter → Persönlichkeit  	racing → Rennen → Rennen  	jockey → Scherz → Jockey  		**Explanation:**  	- "Charakter" (character) is a close translation, but the context implies "Persönlichkeit" (personality) is a more accurate word choice. Since this is a minor variation, it could have been overlooked; however, given that "Persönlichkeit" more closely matches "lively character," it affects the nuance of the sentence.	- "Rennen" is correctly translated, aligning with "Racing" and followed by the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, so no error is marked here.	- "Scherz" (joke) is a clear mistranslation of "jockey," significantly altering the meaning of the sentence and violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Flying Dismount → Markenzeichen → Flying Dismount		**Explanation:** The term "Flying Dismount" is a specific maneuver typically associated with Frankie Dettori and should be retained as such. The candidate translation replaces it with "Markenzeichen" (trademark), which significantly changes the sentence's meaning. This error violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the specific action is crucial to understanding the celebration style.
flying → Fliegen → Flying  	poster boy → Platterjungen → Aushängeschild  	British Flat racing → British Flatt Rennen → britischen Flachrennens  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Fliegen" (to fly) is a mistranslation and needs to retain the components "Flying Finishes" and "Flying Dismounts" as these are established terms in horse racing, adhering to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors**.	2. "Platterjungen" (plate boy) does not preserve the intended meaning of "poster boy" (key figure or representative). This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	3. "British Flatt Rennen" translates to British Flat Races, which doesn't illustrate the intended possession and contextual meaning captured by "britischen Flachrennens". This adheres to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and the inclusion of necessary contextual words.
rollercoaster → rollenfähiges → nervenaufreibend		**Explanation:** "rollenfähiges Fahrzeug" translates to "rollable vehicle," which is not a correct translation for the idiomatic expression "rollercoaster ride" in this context. The reference uses "nervenaufreibend" (nerve-wracking), which captures the intended meaning of a tumultuous or unpredictable experience, adhering to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
big-race → Rassengewinner → Großturniergewinnen   	Magnificent → Magniersieben → Glorreichen  	he → überlebten → er  	served → dienten → erhielt  		**Explanation:**  	- "Rassengewinner" (race winners) is a mistranslation of "big-race winners," which refers to "Großturniergewinnen" (big tournament wins), altering the context and scope significantly.	- "Magnificent" was mistranslated as "Magniersieben" instead of "Glorreichen Sieben" (Glorious Seven), which is a clear error.	- "überlebten" (they survived) incorrectly maintains plurality while the context is about an individual (should be "er überlebte" or similar), not matching the reference's "er."	- "dienten" (served) is a mistranslation of "received" (erhielt), in the context of serving a ban, indicating a change in how the event is described.
struggled → kämpfte → Schwierigkeiten  	suspension → Aussetzung → Sperre  	formidable → enormen → beeindruckende  	strength → Charakter → Stärke  	doubters → Zweifel → Zweiflern  		**Explanation:**  	1. "kämpfte" (fought) is a mistranslation of "struggled", as the reference uses "Schwierigkeiten" (difficulties), which conveys a more accurate sense of the challenge faced.	2. "Aussetzung" (suspension) is technically correct in certain contexts, but "Sperre" is more appropriate in sports contexts, especially with a suspension associated with a penalty or ban.	3. "enormen" (enormous) does not convey the precise meaning of "formidable" in this context, where "beeindruckende" (impressive) aligns better.	4. "Charakter" (character) is a mistranslation of "strength"; "Stärke" is the accurate portrayal of the intended meaning.	5. "Zweifel" (doubt) instead of "Zweiflern" (doubters) changes the grammatical correctness and specific meaning related to people doubting him.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:**  	The candidate translation captures the main ideas and information of the source sentence. The key elements regarding Dettori's statement about continuing until at least the age of 50 are correctly translated in the candidate. Although the structure differs slightly, the meaning remains intact, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, and there are no significant single-word translation errors.
chief → Mitarbeiter → Stabschef  		**Explanation:** "Mitarbeiter" (employee) is a mistranslation of "chief". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because the position of 'chief of staff' implies a high-ranking role, which is not adequately captured by 'employee'.
chief of staff → Mitarbeiter → Stabschef		**Explanation:** "Mitarbeiter" (employee) is a mistranslation of "chief of staff", which changes the meaning of the position held by Sergei Ivanov. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, because the term "chief of staff" specifies a high-level position that is more significant than a general employee.
trusted → vertrauensvollen → Vertrauenskreises		**Explanation:** "vertraunsvollen" (trustful) is a mistranslation of "trusted", which alters the noun "inner circle" to be described as "trustful" rather than "trusted" circle or "circle of trust". This change affects the precise connotation of the circle being one with significant trust placed in it, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. The reference translation expresses this concept with "Vertrauenskreises" (circle of trust).
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately represents the meaning of the source sentence. The difference between "Verkehrsfragen" (transport issues) and "Transportangelegenheiten" (transport matters) is a stylistic choice, not a significant change in meaning. Thus, it aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, and no error is reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Key phrases such as "beschlossen, Iwanow von seinem Amt als Chef der russischen Präsidialverwaltung zu befreien" and "aber keinen Grund gegeben" accurately reflect the intended message. Variations like "hieß es" versus "lautet es" or "Erklärung" versus "Stellungnahme" do not alter the meaning significantly, thus complying with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence. The phrase "Der Stellvertreter von Herrn Iwanow seit 2012, Anton Vaino, wurde als sein Nachfolger ernannt" corresponds well to the source and aligns with the reference, fulfilling the need for contextual accuracy and meaningful expression. No words significantly alter the intended meaning of the original sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the source sentence. While the candidate includes "Herr" (Mr), which the reference omits, it does not change the meaning of the sentence and is an acceptable variation. Therefore, it adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
graduated → abgestuft → machte seinen Abschluss  	served → war tätig → arbeitete  		**Explanation:** "abgestuft" is a mistranslation of "graduated," as "abgestuft" (downgraded) changes the intended meaning of completing an academic program. "war tätig" is a mistranslation of "served," as "war tätig" (was active) doesn't convey the specific role or term of service implied by "arbeited" (worked). Both violations are significant changes, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Contextual Accuracy** rules.
presidential → Präsidentschaftsprotokolle → Protokollchef  	managed → leitete ein → war  	Kremlin → (not translated) → Kreml  	government staff → Regierungsmitarbeiter → Stabsleiter des Regierungspersonals  		**Explanation:** "Präsidentschaftsprotokolle" is a mistranslation of "presidential protocol," which should be closer to "Protokollchef" in this context. The phrase "leitete ein" is misleading as it suggests he initiated or started something, rather than indicating a role he had, which is accurately portrayed as "war" in this context. The source mentions the "Kremlin" website, but "Kremlin" is missing entirely in the candidate translation. Lastly, "Regierungsmitarbeiter" translates to "government employees" or "staff," which lacks the specificity of the role "Stabsleiter des Regierungspersonals" given in the reference.
**No translation errors detected.**  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and matches the reference translation closely in context and expression. Variations like "Bei seiner Ernennung" (on being appointed) and "Über seine Ernennung" (about his appointment) are acceptable as they do not materially alter the meaning. Additionally, "Vielen Dank" and "Danke" are synonymous expressions for "thank you", and "Herrn Putin" and "Putin" are both contextually appropriate references to Mr Putin. Therefore, no significant translation errors were identified.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence, maintaining the focus on the administration's task as described. Variations in vocabulary such as "Verwaltung" for "administration" and "darin, Ihre Tätigkeit als Staatschef ... zu unterstützen" align well with "as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control", fitting within acceptable translation differences. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where variations do not detract from the overall meaning.
(Ivanov → Iwanow → Ivanov)  	(post → Post → Posten)  		**Explanation:** "Iwanow" is the German transliteration of "Ivanov", whereas in this context, maintaining the transliteration as "Ivanov" is preferred as per the reference. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the reference maintains consistency in naming. "Post" is a mistranslation of "posten" meaning job or position, whereas "Post" in German usually means "mail". This violates the **Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes the intended meaning of Ivanov's role.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Überzeugen die Lächeln?" (Do the smiles convince?) preserves the intended meaning of the source sentence and does not introduce a single-word translation error, aligning with the instructions to prioritize meaningful errors. While "die lächelnden Gesichter" (the smiling faces) in the reference translation adds detail, "die Lächeln" (the smiles) captures the core meaning without significant change.
mystified → verleumdet → geheimnisumwoben  		**Explanation:** "verleumdet" (slandered) is a mistranslation of "mystified". This significantly changes the intended meaning, as the original sentence suggests a sense of confusion rather than defamation. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it alters the meaning significantly.
Ivanov → Iwanow → Ivanov  	allies → Verbündeten → Vertrauten  	served → gedient → arbeitet  		**Explanation:**  	- The name "Ivanov" is mistranslated as "Iwanow". While sometimes German adaptations of Russian names might change, the consistent translation in formal texts keeps the original spelling unless commonly changed.	- "Allies" is translated as "Verbündeten". While this word can mean allies, the reference uses "Vertrauten", which conveys a sense of being a trusted confidant, fitting the context better.	- "Served" is translated as "gedient". While "serviert" might mean served in terms of waiting/bartending in German, in this context of working or having a role, "arbeitet" or "arbeitete" is more contextually accurate, following the source meaning of serving in a service like the KGB.
chief of staff → Mitarbeiter → Stabschef  		**Explanation:** "Mitarbeiter" (employee) is a mistranslation of "chief of staff". This significantly alters the hierarchical position and importance within the original context, making it a violation of the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. The most significant word in this mistranslation is "Mitarbeiter" compared to the correct "Stabschef".
chief of staff → Personalführer → Stabschef		**Explanation:** "Personalführer" (personnel leader) is a mistranslation of "chief of staff". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Personalführer" does not convey the same specific role or recognized position within an organizational hierarchy as "chief of staff", which is appropriately translated as "Stabschef".
cameras → der → für  	especially → gerade → vor allem  		**Explanation:** "der" (of the) is a mistranslation of "for" in the context of the smiles intended for the cameras. "gerade" (just) does not convey the emphasis of "especially", which would be more accurately translated as "vor allem" in this context.
fall-out → Ergebnis → Folge  		**Explanation:** "Ergebnis" (result) is a mistranslation of "fall-out" in this context. While "Ergebnis" and "Folge" can sometimes be used interchangeably, in this context "Folge" (consequence) better captures the implication of "fall-out" as an adverse effect of a struggle, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Das weiß noch niemand." effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence "No-one knows yet." The reference translation uses "derzeit" which means "currently," but "noch" which means "yet" also correctly captures the intended meaning. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as both translations retain the overall meaning.
(once → studiert → einst)  	(touted → studiert → angepriesen)  		**Explanation:**  	- "studiert" (studied) is a mistranslation of "once" and "touted". The candidate translation uses "studiert", which incorrectly conveys the idea of being studied rather than previously considered or praised. The reference uses "einst" for "once" and "angepriesen" for "touted", both of which are more contextually appropriate.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the meaning and context of the source sentence accurately. There are synonymous expressions like "In Äußerungen zu Herrn Putin" vs. "In seinen Bemerkungen an Putin" and "komplizierten Posten" vs. "komplizierten Posten," which do not significantly alter the meaning, so no mistranslations are detected following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
presidential → Präsidiums → Präsidialverwaltung		**Explanation:** "Präsidiums" (presidium) is a mistranslation of "presidential", which changes the specific role being referred to. The correct term in this context is "Präsidialverwaltung" as given in the reference translation. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by selecting the word that alters the intended position significantly.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "übernahm die Stelle" and "nahm den Posten an" are acceptable ways to express "took up the post" in German. The candidate translation does not contain words that significantly alter the meaning when compared to the reference, adhering to both the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule and the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. "Er war zuvor stellvertretender Ministerpräsident und Verteidigungsminister" appropriately translates "He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister," with all key concepts and terms matching between the translations, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the meaning of each part of the source sentence when compared to the reference translation. The structure and key terms are preserved, and both translations convey the intended information correctly. Therefore, no meaningful single-word errors are present, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule and the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately represents the source in terms of meaning and context. The phrase "Ende der 90er Jahre" (end of the 90s) conveys a similar time period to "In den späten 1990er Jahren" (in the late 1990s). There are no mistranslations that significantly change the meaning of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation sufficiently conveys the meaning of the source sentence and maintains the same contextual accuracy as the reference translation. The use of "Herrn Iwanow" for "Mr Ivanov" and "vertraut hat" for "trusted" do not significantly alter the intended meaning in a way that introduces an error, considering common variations in translation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the source sentence's meaning, with no single-word translation errors identified according to the provided guidelines. "Es war einmal angenommen worden" matches "It was once thought," "Herr Iwanow" is the correct translation for "Mr Ivanov," and "dritte Amtszeit" correctly translates "third term," among others. Differences in style or syntax, such as "es war einmal angenommen worden" versus "einst wurde angenommen," do not significantly alter the meaning, thus not constituting a translation error under the given rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, and the words selected are appropriate within the context. There are no single-word mistranslations that significantly alter the meaning of the sentence. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules. The differences observed, such as "übernommen" (assumed/taken over) and "eingenommen" (occupied/taken), are acceptable variations and do not affect the overall meaning.
Putin → Herr Putin → Putin  	prime minister → Premierminister → Ministerpräsident  	presidency → Präsidentschaft → Präsidenten  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Herr Putin" (Mr Putin) incorrectly introduces a title not present in the source sentence, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Premierminister" is less appropriate than "Ministerpräsident" in this context for the German "prime minister" equivalent, which affects the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it refers to a specific political office.	3. "Präsidentschaft" (presidency) is less specific compared to "Präsidenten" (president), which aligns more accurately with the original intended meaning. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by identifying the key term differing in meaning.
Criminal Minds → Krimineller → Criminal Minds		**Explanation:** "Krimineller" (criminal) is a mistranslation of "Criminal Minds," which is the name of the TV show. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes the meaning from referring to the show to calling the person a criminal. This is a significant error as it misrepresents the context.
altercation → Änderung → Auseinandersetzung  	show → Schauspiels → Serie  		**Explanation:** "Änderung" (change) is a mistranslation of "altercation", which significantly changes the meaning as it does not convey a physical conflict. "Schauspiels" (drama/theatrical play) is a mistranslation of "show" in the context provided, where "Serie" (series) is the correct term in German for a television series. Both errors violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
Television → TV → Television  	dismissal → Entlassung → Kündigung  		**Explanation:** "TV" is an abbreviation of "Television," and while commonly understood, the reference translation retains the full form, satisfying the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule. "Entlassung" (dismissal) is accurately contextually synonymous with "Kündigung" (dismissal/firing), but because the example specifically identifies single-word discrepancies where the reference translation uses a different term systematically, it's reported here.
agent → Sondergesandte → Special Agent		**Explanation:** "Sondergesandte" (special envoy) is a mistranslation of "Special Agent", significantly altering the professional role depicted in the sentence. This follows the **Identify Mistranslations** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, as it changes the job title from law enforcement to that of a diplomatic envoy.
set → und → am Set  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation completely omits the phrase "on the set", which is present in the source and referenced in the reference translation as "am Set". Instead, the candidate has "und" (and), which is a conjunction and does not convey the location or context provided by "on the set". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it changes the context of where the differences occurred.
regret → bedauere → bereue  	occurred → passiert → Vorfall  	statement → Erklärung → Mitteilung  		**Explanation:** "bedauere" (to regret) differs from "bereue" (to repent), modifying the degree of personal responsibility or emotion. "passiert" (happened) should refer to "Vorfall" (incident/occurrence) to fit the context. "Erklärung" (explanation) is a mistranslation of "Mitteilung" (statement/communication), altering the formal context. All errors are significant based on the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
Details → Wie → Einzelheiten	show → Ausstrahlung → Serie	written → aufgeführt → herausgeschrieben		**Explanation:** 	1. "Wie" (how) in the candidate translation incorrectly replaces "Details" from the source, resulting in a loss of the meaning that specific information is being discussed. The correct translation should reflect "Einzelheiten."	2. "Ausstrahlung" (broadcast) is misleading in the context because the show refers to the television series itself, not its broadcast. "Serie" is an accurate translation of "show."	3. "aufgeführt" (performed) does not capture the meaning of "written out," which contextually means the character will be removed from the storyline. The correct translation should be "herausgeschrieben."
(54-year-old → 54-Jährigen → 54-Jährige)  	starred → verhungerten → spielte  	show → Schauplatz → Serie  		**Explanation:**  	- "54-Jährigen" is a mistranslation of "54-year-old", which should be "54-Jährige". The gender and number are incorrect, affecting the sense of who the subject is.	- "verhungerten" (starved) is a significant mistranslation of "starred", altering the meaning of the subject's role in the sitcom and therefore violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Schauplatz" (scene/location) is not the correct term for "show" in this context where "Serie" (series) fits the intended meaning. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Criminal Minds → die Kriminalität → Criminal Minds		**Explanation:** "die Kriminalität" (criminality) is a mistranslation of the proper noun "Criminal Minds," which is the name of a television show. This violates the **Identify Mistranslations** rule, as it changes the referent from a series title to a general concept.
hoped → gehofft → gehofft  	see → durchzusetzen → dabei zu sein  		**Explanation:** "gehofft" is a correct translation for "hoped", but "durchzusetzen" is a mistranslation for "see [it through to the end]". The more contextually appropriate translation that aligns with the intended meaning is "dabei zu sein", which conveys being present or involved to the end rather than forcing or implementing something.
(actors → Akteuren → Schauspielern)  	(crew → Mannschaft → Crew)  		**Explanation:** "Akteuren" (performers) is a less accurate translation of "actors" in the context of this sentence, which specifically refers to "Schauspielern". "Mannschaft" (team) is a general term and doesn't convey the same industry-specific meaning as "Crew", which is the standard word used in film and television contexts in German. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule for a precise translation.	
show → Rückkehr → Staffel  		**Explanation:** "Rückkehr" (return) is a mistranslation of "season". In this context, "return" should refer to "season" as in the recurrence of the show. The word "Staffel" accurately represents "season" in the context of series or shows.
fish → Fischland → Fische		**Explanation:** "Fischland" is not an appropriate translation for "fish" in this context. "Fischland" suggests a misinterpretation, as it combines "fish" with "land", whereas the correct reference word is "Fische", which means "fishes". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since it fails to accurately convey the intended meaning.
Banff man → Bankmann → Einwohner von Banff  	fish → Fisch → Fische  		**Explanation:** "Bankmann" (bank man) is a mistranslation of "Banff man" which refers to a person from Banff, not a bank. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Additionally, "Fisch" (fish) is singular while the source and reference imply multiple fish ("Fische"), violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by changing the number intended.
- thinks → ist der Ansicht → denkt	- sand eels → Fische → Sandaale	- waterspout → Wasserspurt → Springbrunnen		**Explanation:** 	1. "ist der Ansicht" (is of the opinion) is a less direct translation of "thinks". While not as severe, it alters the style of expression, but it does not significantly change the meaning.	2. "Fische" (fish) is a mistranslation of "sand eels", which changes the specific type of fish being referred to.	3. "Wasserspurt" (incorrect or nonexistent translation) is a mistranslation of "waterspout", which is more accurately conveyed by "Springbrunnen" (fountain) in the context, although the exact translation for a meteorological phenomenon is typically "Wasserhose" (waterspout). The mistake misrepresents the intended mechanism described in the sentence.
500m → 500 Millionen → 500 Meter  	posted → dargestellt → veröffentlichte  	two-inch → Zwei-Zang → zwei Zoll  		**Explanation:**  	1. "500 Millionen" (500 million) is a mistranslation of "500m" (500 meters) causing a significant change in meaning regarding the distance from the sea. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	2. "dargestellt" (depicted) is a mistranslation of "posted" which means "veröffentlicht" (published/posted), following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the intended action is about posting a video online.	3. "Zwei-Zang" does not align with "two-inch", which should be "zwei Zoll", and is therefore a significant mistranslation. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, focusing on the mistranslation of measurement.
Queensferry Crossing → Fragebögen, die passieren → Queensferry Crossing  		**Explanation:** "Fragebögen, die passieren" (questionnaires that happen) is an incorrect translation of "Queensferry Crossing", which is a proper noun referring to a specific bridge. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the meaning changes dramatically from a proper noun to an unrelated noun phrase.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, with "Projekt", "in Höhe von", and "abgeschlossen sein" fitting well within the context and meaning intended, according to the reference translation. Any minor structural differences do not alter the intended meaning significantly.
1. joined → angeschlossen → verbunden  	2. Queensferry → Queenferry → Queensferry  		**Explanation:**  	1. The word "angeschlossen" is a mistranslation of "joined". In this context, the correct translation should be "verbunden", as indicated by the reference translation, which emphasizes the act of connecting two structures, fitting the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	2. The word "Queenferry" in the candidate translation is missing an "s" and should match "Queensferry", which is the correct spelling in the reference, aligning with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
first → erste → erste  	closures → Schließungen → Verschließungen  	fans → fans → Deckgebläse  	towers → Tümmer → Türme  		**Explanation:**  	1. "erste" correctly translates to "first," and although it is in a different form (masculine "erste" vs. neutral "erstes"), this does not alter the meaning, so it is not listed as an error.	2. "Schließungen" (closures) does not capture the specific context of industrial or mechanical closures alluded to by "Verschließungen," which refers to a technical closing mechanism rather than a generic one.	3. "fans" in English were translated as "fans" in the candidate, which is incorrect since "Deckgebläse" is the specific term used in this context.	4. "Tümmer" (nonsensical in this context, possibly a typo or misinterpretation for "poles" in other settings) is a mistranslation of "towers," significantly altering the structure being discussed. The correct translation is "Türme," meaning towers.
Fife → Fafe → Fife  	section → Brücke → Brückenabschnitt  	weighs → wichtig → wiegt  		**Explanation:** "Fafe" is a mistranslation of "Fife", potentially causing confusion about the location. "Brücke" (bridge) is incorrectly used instead of "Brückenabschnitt" (bridge section), which fails to convey the specific part of the structure being discussed. "wichtig" (important) is a mistranslation of "weighs", which changes the intended description of the bridge's weight.
10,000 → 10 000 → 10.000  	20,000 → 20 000 → 20.000  	stay-cables → Lagerkabeln → Schrägseile  		**Explanation:**  	1. "10,000" and "20,000" are numerically correct in the candidate but formatted differently than in the reference. In German language style guides, a dot is used as the thousands separator, hence "10 000" should be "10.000" and "20 000" should be "20.000".	2. "Lagerkabeln" (literally "storage cables") is a mistranslation of "stay-cables". The correct translation is "Schrägseile", which refers to the specific type of cables used in bridge construction. This error affects the meaning significantly due to the technical nature of the term.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "abgeschlossen sein" and "fertiggestellt werden" convey the intended meaning of "to be complete". The candidate translation correctly represents the original sentence, including the details of the project value and time frame. Therefore, there are no significant single-word mistranslations.
site → Website → Baustelle		**Explanation:** In the candidate sentence, "Website" is a mistranslation of "site", which should be translated as "Baustelle" in this context. This error significantly changes the meaning as it refers to an internet location instead of a physical construction site, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Queensferry → Queenferry → Queensferry  		**Explanation:** "Queenferry" is a mistranslation of "Queensferry". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it alters the proper noun and the specific name of the bridge. All other words maintain the intended meaning when comparing the candidate and reference translations.
engineering → Maschinerie → Ingenieurskunst		**Explanation:** "Maschinerie" (machinery) is a mistranslation of "engineering". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the context pertains to engineering feats and not machinery, making "Ingenieurskunst" (engineering art/expertise) the correct term.
viaduct → Fahrzeug → Viadukt		**Explanation:** "Fahrzeug" (vehicle) is a mistranslation of "viaduct", which significantly changes the intended meaning of the sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the closure connects a viaduct, not a vehicle, to the bridge.
concrete → abgeworfen → Betonguss  	deck → Teppich → Deck  		**Explanation:** "Abgeworfen" (discarded/thrown off) is a mistranslation of "concrete" in this context. The word "Betonguss" (concrete cast) is used correctly in the reference sentence. "Teppich" (carpet) is a mistranslation of "deck", which significantly changes the meaning, as a "carpet" is not a valid component in the context of a bridge.
Forth → Foth → Forth  	closure → Schließung → Verschluss  		**Explanation:** "Foth" is a mistranslation of "Forth". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since the proper name is incorrectly translated. "Schließung" (closure) changes the meaning of the sentence compared to "Verschluss" (fastening/closure in context), which is closer to the intended project milestone in engineering terms. This is in line with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because the expected connotation of "closure" in the context of construction should reflect significant progress completion, not just the act of closing.
closure → Schließung → Verschluss  	leading edge → führende → zukunftsweisenden  	civil engineering → zivile Bautechnik → Hoch- und Tiefbau  		**Explanation:**  	- "Schließung" (closure) is a mistranslation of "closure," which in context refers more precisely to "Verschluss" given the technical context.  	- "führende" (leading) is a mistranslation of "leading edge," which in context means "zukunftsweisenden" (cutting-edge or forward-thinking).  	- "zivile Bautechnik" (civil engineering) is inaccurate in this context. While "civil engineering" can often be understood as "Bauingenieurwesen" or "Hoch- und Tiefbau," the intended meaning in this sentence is best captured by "Hoch- und Tiefbau," reflecting both structural and civil engineering.
road deck → Straßenabschnitt → Straßendeckabschnitt  	expanding → expandierenden → im Ausbau befindlichen  	North Tower → Nord-Turm → Nordturm  		**Explanation:** 		- "Straßenabschnitt" (road section) is a mistranslation for "road deck section" as it lacks the specific context of "deck," which is important in construction terminology. 	- "expandierenden" (expanding) is a mistranslation of "expanding" in this context as it doesn't convey the meaning of being "under construction" or "in development," which "im Ausbau befindlichen" does. 	- "Nord-Turm" (North Tower) should be "Nordturm" as a single compound word is more contextually accurate in German for a tower name.  
(northern → Ansatz → nördlichen)  	(approach → Ansatz → Zubringerbrücke)  	(viaduct → Ansatz → Zubringerbrücke)  	(by → mit → durch)  	(done → durchgezogen → erreicht)  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Ansatz" (approach/basis) is not a correct translation for "northern" and "approach viaduct." In the reference, "nördlichen" and "Zubringerbrücke" correctly convey "northern" and "approach viaduct."	2. "Mit" (with) is a mistranslation for "by" in this context. "Durch" (through/by means of) in the reference matches the prepositional use of "by."	3. "Durchgezogen" (pulled through) doesn't convey the meaning of "done" as part of the phrase "This was done by...". "Erreicht" (achieved) better captures the intended meaning in context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both the candidate translation and the reference translation accurately capture the meaning of the source sentence. The words "Operation" and "Tätigkeit" can both fit within the intended meaning of "operation" in context, as "Tätigkeit" can also imply a task or activity. Therefore, there are no significant translation errors that alter the meaning.
viaduct → Produkt → Viadukt  	weighs → gewichtet → wiegt  	gradient → Grab → Steigung  		**Explanation:** 	- "Produkt" (product) is a mistranslation of "viaduct", which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it completely misidentifies the subject.	- "gewichtet" (weighted) is an incorrect translation of "weighs" in this context. The reference correctly uses "wiegt" to indicate the weight without altering it.	- "Grab" (grave) is a significant mistranslation of "gradient", which changes the intended meaning of an incline. The reference uses "Steigung" (slope/gradient), which is correct.
tolerances → Toleranz → Toleranzen		**Explanation:** "Toleranz" (singular) is a mistranslation of "tolerances" (plural). This changes the intended meaning because it applies the idea incorrectly to a singular case rather than multiple instances, which is critical in engineering contexts where multiple tolerances matter. Thus, it violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Glücklicherweise ist alles sehr gut gelaufen" conveys the same meaning as the reference translation "Glücklicherweise verlief alles sehr gut." Both "ist gelaufen" and "verlief" appropriately express the concept of "went" in this context, maintaining the sentence's intended meaning. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule where both translations are acceptable variants.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** While there are slight structural differences between the candidate and reference translation, the meaning is preserved accurately. Both express the concept that the men are fortunate to be alive, which aligns with the source sentence. Therefore, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no translation errors are reported.
"thrown" → "vertrieben" → "geworfen"		**Explanation:** The word "vertrieben" (evicted/driven away) is a mistranslation of "thrown". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it significantly changes the nature of the event described in the sentence.
alarm → Alarmglocke → Alarm  	crew → Besatzung → Crew   	incident → Vorfall → Ereignis  		**Explanation:** 	- "Alarmglocke" (alarm bell) is a mistranslation of "alarm." The intended expression should be simply "Alarm" in this context as it captures the idiomatic usage correctly and follows the rule of **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.	- "Besatzung" (crew/team) instead of "Crew." While it is often synonymous, "Crew" is the term used in the reference and is more precise, ensuring a closer fit with the source, complying with **Focus on Single-Word Errors**.	- "Vorfall" (incident) instead of "Ereignis" (event) is a semantic error because "Ereignis" conveys a neutral or possibly positive event unless context specifies otherwise, whereas "Vorfall" can imply something negative or unspecified, preserving clarity with the original intent.
struggled → kämpften → Schwierigkeiten  	swim → Sicherheit → schwimmen  	boat → Schiff → Boot  		**Explanation:**  	1. "kämpften" (fought) is a mistranslation of "struggled." In this context, "Struggled to swim" should be more about the difficulty in swimming rather than fighting. Therefore, "Schwierigkeiten" reflects the correct sense of struggling.	   	2. "Sicherheit" (safety) mistranslates "swim" because the candidate sentence incorrectly focuses on the outcome rather than the action of swimming, which is central to the meaning of the source sentence.		3. "Schiff" (ship) is a mistranslation of "boat," which alters the specific type of vessel being described. It's important for the translation to maintain the distinction between "Boot" and "Schiff" as per their meanings in German.
saw → sahen → sahen  	circling → fuhr → um sich drehte  	lifeboat helm → Lebensboot → Leiter der Rettungsstation  		**Explanation:**  	- "sahen" translates "saw" correctly; however, the error occurs with "fuhr" rather than "um sich drehte" for "circling", as it means "drove" rather than the intended meaning of "circling" or "turning."	- "Lebensboot" is a mistranslation of "lifeboat helm"; the candidate translation uses "Lebensboot" (incorrectly referring to "lifeboat" only), while the reference correctly indicates "Leiter der Rettungsstation" (head of rescue station), capturing the position and role intended by "lifeboat helm." 		Following **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, I've isolated and corrected the most significant translation errors.
we → sie → das Boot		Explanation: The candidate translation uses "sie" (them) for "it" (referring to "the boat") in the context, significantly altering the meaning as "sie" would imply multiple objects or people, whereas "das Boot" correctly identifies a singular object, the boat. This is a violation of the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
exhausted → erschöpft wurde → erschöpft  	buoy → Jungen → Boje  	lifejacket → Rettungsjacke → Rettungsweste  		**Explanation:** "erschöpft wurde" (was exhausted) incorrectly implies the man was made exhausted at that moment, whereas "erschöpft" conveys he was found in a state of exhaustion, thereby preserving the intended meaning. "Jungen" (boy) is a mistranslation of "buoy", significantly changing the scenario since humans and buoys serve different roles in this context. "Rettungsjacke" (rescue jacket) is a less common term than "Rettungsweste" (lifejacket) for the context of a buoyancy aid, but either can be used interchangeably, so it's included for clarity considering standard usage.
taken → genommen → kamen  	lifeboat → Lebensboot → Rettungsstation  		**Explanation:**  	1. "genommen" (taken) is not the best translation for "were all taken on board" in this context, as "kamen" (came) better captures the intended meaning of being brought onto the lifeboat.	2. "Lebensboot" (lifeboat) seems incorrect here when followed by "zurückgebracht" (brought back), which implies being taken to a place, such as a "Rettungsstation" (rescue station), as per the reference translation. The translation seems to have misinterpreted the end destination of "back to the lifeboat station."
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon reviewing, the candidate translation maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence, with any slight variations being stylistic rather than significant changes in meaning. The candidate captures all essential components such as the throwing into the water, the notion of luck, and the condition of being alive and uninjured, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
engine → Rettungsschirm → Notstoppleine  	driving → keim → steuerte  		**Explanation:**  	- "Rettungsschirm" (rescue parachute) is a mistranslation of "emergency kill cord" in the context of a boat engine, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "keim" is not a valid German word in the context of driving or steering, mismatching "driving". This violates the **Contextual Accuracy** rule as it clearly doesn't convey the intended meaning.
someone → Schurken → Männer		**Explanation:** "Schurken" (villains) is a mistranslation of "guys" and changes the tone and meaning of the sentence to imply something negative about the people being referred to. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Schurken" does not accurately reflect the neutral meaning of "guys."
injured → Schwerverletzte → Schwer verletzt  	stabs → steht → sticht  	ex-girlfriend → ehemaligen Freund → Ex-Freundin  		**Explanation:** "Schwerverletzte" translates to "seriously injured people/person", which is not a correct translation for "seriously injured" as a condition. "steht" means "stands" which is incorrect for "stabs". "ehemaligen Freund" translates to "former friend", mismatching the gender and relationship context of "ex-girlfriend". Each of these errors significantly changes the intended meaning.
ex-girlfriend → junge Freundin → Ex-Freundin  	Harburg district → Harburg-Gebiet → Hamburg-Harburg  		**Explanation:**  	- "junge Freundin" (young friend) is a mistranslation of "ex-girlfriend". This changes the meaning significantly, as it refers to a different relationship type. The word "junge" (young) should not be there, and "Freundin" should be "Ex-Freundin" to maintain the original meaning, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.  	- "Harburg-Gebiet" (Harburg area) does not accurately represent "Hamburg's Harburg district". The candidate translation fails to specify "Hamburg" and uses "Gebiet" (area) instead of the more precise term "Bezirk" or the compound form "Hamburg-Harburg" used in the reference. This misrepresents the specific location, thus falling under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
50-year-old → 50-jährige → 50-Jährige  	apartment → Abteilung → Wohnung  	belongings → Köpfe → Dinge  		**Explanation:**  	- "50-jährige" (female) is a mistranslation of "50-year-old" referring to a male, which is "50-Jährige". This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, where gender must match the context.	- "Abteilung" (department) is a mistranslation of "apartment". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the location's meaning.	- "Köpfe" (heads) is a mistranslation of "belongings". This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule since the objects being collected are personal belongings, not heads.
drunk → Betrunkenenangreifer → alkoholisierte  	attacker → Betrunkenenangreifer → Täter  	his → seines → seiner  	ex-girlfriend's → seines ehemaligen Freundes → seiner Ex-Freundin  		**Explanation:** "Betrunkenenangreifer" is not a correct word; it combines two separate concepts incorrectly and mistranslates both "drunk" and "attacker". "Seines" and "ehemaligen Freundes" are incorrect translations for "his" and "ex-girlfriend's", neither reflecting the intended possessive form and gender. These errors significantly alter the sentence's meaning, therefore violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
came → bestand → kam  	he → sie → er  	stabbed → bestand → stach  		**Explanation:**  	1. "bestand" (passed) is a mistranslation of "came", which changes the meaning from arriving to something unrelated.  	2. "sie" (she) is used instead of "er" (he), which changes the agent of the action.  	3. "bestand" (passed) is again used instead of "stabbed", which completely alters the violent nature of the event. These errors follow the **Identify Mistranslations** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules since they significantly change the intended actions and subjects described in the sentence.
44-year-old → 44-jährigen → 44-Jährige  		**Explanation:** The candidate uses "44-jährigen" which is plural and masculine, whereas the source and reference context clearly talk about a singular woman, correctly translated as "44-Jährige". This is a significant contextual error.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence "Die Polizei hat es geschafft, den Täter festzunehmen" and the reference translation "Die Polizei konnte den Täter festnehmen" convey the same meaning as the source sentence. The phrase "hat es geschafft" (managed) and "konnte" (could) both appropriately translate the action of successfully arresting the perpetrator, and do not alter the intended meaning. Hence, there are no significant single-word mistranslation errors in the candidate translation.
ex-girlfriend → Freundes → Ex-Freundin  	called → nannte → rief an  		**Explanation:** "Freundes" (friend) is a mistranslation of "ex-girlfriend," changing the gender and relationship context, which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "nannte" (named) is a mistranslation of "called," as it alters the intended action of making a phone call to a naming action, thus breaking the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
called → rief → alarmierte  		**Explanation:** "rief" (called) is a mistranslation of "called" in this context as per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule. The intended meaning here is closer to "alarmierte" (alerted or alarmed), indicating a more urgent action. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the word choice changes the perceived urgency and nature of the action.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the meaning of the source sentence. Although there are minor differences in phrasing and structure, the conveyed message is consistent, and there are no single-word mistranslations that significantly alter the intended meaning.
(leave → verlassen → bewegen)  	(apartment → Abteilung → Wohnung)  		**Explanation:**  		1. **bewegen vs. verlassen:** The word "verlassen" (leave) in the candidate translation does not exactly match the nuance of "bewegen" (move) as used in this context. The reference uses "bewegen" to express more than just the act of leaving – it implies persuasion, fitting the context better.	   	2. **Abteilung vs. Wohnung:** "Abteilung" (department) is a mistranslation of "apartment." This significantly alters the meaning of the sentence, as the context concerns a residential setting rather than a department in an organization.
consequently → Folglich → Darum  	set off → ausgegangen → ging  	home → zu Hause → Haus  	partner → Partner → Lebensgefährten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Folglich" translates to "therefore," while "Darum" fits better as "consequently" in this context, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "ausgegangen" suggests going out socially or for an activity, while "ging" directly translates to "went", which aligns closer to "set off" as per the **Identify Mistranslations** instruction.	3. "zu Hause" implies being inside the home, whereas "Haus" translates to "home" in a physical sense, fitting the desired expression, thus following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors**.	4. "Partner" is a direct equivalent, but "Lebensgefährten" conveys the intended idea of a living partner more precisely, following **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.
ex-partner → ehemaligen Partner → Ex-Lebensgefährtin  		**Explanation:** "ehemaligen Partner" (former partner) is a mistranslation of "ex-partner", which, in this context, specifically refers to a former romantic partner, likely female given the gender implications of "Lebensgefährtin". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it misses the specific nuance of "Ex-Lebensgefährtin" (ex-female partner), altering the intended meaning in the source.
1. apartment → Abteilung → Wohnung  	2. 50-year-old → 50-jährigen → 50-Jährige  	3. attacked → attackierten → griff  	4. ex-girlfriend → ehemaligen Freund → Ex-Freundin  		**Explanation:**  	- "Abteilung" means "department" and is a mistranslation of "apartment."  	- "50-jährigen" is the plural form of "50-year-old" which should correctly be "50-Jährige" in the singular form to match the source sentence.  	- "attackierten" is a plural verb form mistakenly used here where "griff" was needed, in line with the singular subject "50-Jährige."  	- "ehemaligen Freund" refers to a male "former friend," which is incorrect since "ex-girlfriend" refers to a female and should be translated as "Ex-Freundin."
low-cost → Niedriglohn → günstige  		**Explanation:** "Niedriglohnwohnungen" (low-wage housing) is a mistranslation of "low-cost housing". The focus is on affordability, not wage levels, making this a significant error that changes the meaning of the sentence. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the error doesn't fit the intended meaning in context.
investors → Investoren → Investoren  	step up to the plate → auf den Tisch legen → in die Pflicht genommen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Investoren" is a correct translation of "investors," so no error is noted here; listing it confirms the lack of issue in this part of the translation.	2. "auf den Tisch legen" (put on the table) is a mistranslation of the idiomatic expression "step up to the plate," which means to take responsibility or engage more actively. The reference translation "in die Pflicht genommen" (be held accountable) conveys the intended meaning. This fits the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules, as the keyword and concept are misrepresented in the candidate sentence.
low-cost homes → Niedriglohnhäuser → günstige Wohnungen  		**Explanation:** "Niedriglohnhäuser" (low-wage houses) is a mistranslation of "low-cost homes". The intended meaning relates to affordable housing, and the correct term is "günstige Wohnungen", following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as the mistranslation significantly alters the type of housing discussed.
council → Ratstagung → Ratssitzung  	homes → Wohnhäuser → Wohnen  		**Explanation:** "Ratstagung" is a mistranslation of "council meeting" as it implies a conference or congress rather than a meeting. "Wohnhäuser" (residential buildings) changes the intended meaning of the action plan, which is broadly about "homes" or "housing".
won't → ist → ist  	smooth sailing → reibungslos → Streit ist programmiert  		**Explanation:** "ist" (is) mistranslates "won't", as it incorrectly negates the sentence's message about future objections. Additionally, "reibungslos" (smooth) does not capture the idiomatic expression "smooth sailing" which suggests anticipated trouble or conflict. The reference translation captures this with "Streit ist programmiert" (dispute is programmed).
cost → Niedriglohn → günstigen  	homes → Häuser → Wohnungen  		**Explanation:** "Niedriglohn" (low-wage) is a mistranslation of "low-cost", which alters the intended meaning of affordable housing. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes from cost to wage. "Häuser" (houses) is a less suitable translation for "homes" when compared to "Wohnungen" (apartments or housing), especially in the context of low-cost or affordable housing. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the meaning of the source sentence effectively. Although the reference translation is different, the candidate translation does not contain any meaningful single-word errors according to the instructions, as it accurately reflects the absence of a settlement on the specified point.
municipal → kommunalem → städtischen  	homes → Häuser → Wohnungen  	designate → bezeichnen → ausweisen  		**Explanation:** 	- "kommunalem" is a mistranslation of "municipal." "städtischen" (urban/city-related) is more contextually appropriate for "municipal" land.	- "Häuser" (houses) is a mistranslation of "homes." "Wohnungen" (apartments) more accurately reflects the typical context of "social housing."	- "bezeichnen" (designate) is also incorrect when compared to "ausweisen" (to mark/define officially), which is the precise action required for social housing regulation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "kostengünstigen" for "low-cost," which is a synonymous way of expressing the intended meaning. The phrase "ältere Häuser" aligns with "older homes", and "renoviert werden" corresponds well with the idea of "are renovated" from the source sentence, even though the reference translation provides a different construction. The candidate captures the essence and meaning of the original sentence, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
Bratmann → [Omitted] → Bratmann	ground → Boden → Flächen  		**Explanation:** "Bratmann" is omitted in the candidate translation. While this is more of an omission error, it affects understanding as attribution of statements is crucial. "Boden" (ground) is a mistranslation of "Flächen" (areas), which fits the intended meaning better in this context according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
investors → Investoren → Investoren  	building → aufbauen → bauen  	spaces → Räumen → Flächen  	homes → Häuser → Wohnungen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Investoren" can remain the same as the source and reference do not provide a different term.	- "aufbauen" (build on) is used in the context of construction but isn't as precise as "bauen" (build) when referring to creating structures such as homes, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "Räumen" (spaces) is a valid translation but "Flächen" (areas) is more accurate in this context of land development, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Häuser" (houses) vs "Wohnungen" (homes/apartments) changes the specific type of living spaces mentioned, altering the meaning as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the key components and meaning of the source sentence when compared to the reference. The words used in the candidate sentence align well with both the source and reference sentences, and they do not significantly alter the intended meaning. The choice of words such as "kommunales" (municipal) and "Bedenken" (concerns) are fitting alternatives. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule in accepting acceptable variations without listing them as errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence. The phrases "Derzeit gibt es keine Einigung" and "Es gibt momentan noch keine Einigung" both convey the lack of agreement at the moment, and "zwischen den Fraktionen" matches "between groups." The slight variations are acceptable and don't violate the instructions.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with the reference translation. The key elements "wants to put as few rules on investors as possible" are meaningfully preserved as "will möglichst wenige Regeln für die Investoren einführen." Variations like "wants" to "will" and "rules" to "Regeln" do not constitute significant errors within this context, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence "Die Linke will, dass den Investoren strengere Anforderungen auferlegt werden." adequately captures the meaning of the source sentence. The phrase "strengere Anforderungen" aligns closely with "stringent requirements", and "auferlegt werden" conveys the imposition aspect. Thus, there are no significant single-word translation errors, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
according → nach → so		hotting up → in die Höhe → bahne sich eine Verschärfung an		**Explanation:** The word "nach" is a mistranslation of "according." In this context, it should be "so," which fits better with the structure and meaning in the reference translation. The phrase "in die Höhe" (into the height) is a mistranslation of "hotting up," and the suitable translation in this context is "bahne sich eine Verschärfung an," implying a worsening or escalation of the situation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although there are differences between the candidate and reference translations, the key concepts are accurately conveyed. The candidate uses "Aktionsplan" (action plan) and "Baubehörden" (building authorities) which are acceptable synonyms for "Handlungskonzept" (action concept) and "Bauverwaltung" (building administration) respectively, without altering the main meaning of the sentence. Thus, no significant single-word translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The phrase "more staff will be needed" is translated as "wir werden mehr Personal brauchen," which conveys the intent adequately. Though the syntactic structures differ, there are no single-word mistranslations violating the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as the overall meaning is maintained.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** While there are some differences in phrasing, both "nicht klar" and "unklar" convey the meaning of "not clear". Similarly, "Fachpersonal" and "Fachkräfte" are both used to refer to specialized staff and preserve the sentence's meaning. Thus, there are no significant translation errors.
1. program → Programm → Programm  	2. approximately → ca. → rund  	3. homes → Häuser → Wohnungen  	4. anyway → sowieso → ohnehin  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Programm" is consistent with both the source and reference. This triple shouldn't be listed.  	2. "ca." (an abbreviation for "circa," meaning approximately) is acceptable for "approximately", but the reference uses "rund." 	3. "Häuser" (houses) is a mistranslation of "homes," where "Wohnungen" (apartments) is the appropriate translation in this context, as suggested by the reference.  	4. "sowieso" (anyway) could fit generally but "ohnehin" is the precise word that carries the intended meaning in this context as per the reference.  	Both 2 and 4 are not significantly altering meanings to create misinterpretation so should not be marked as wrong necessarily.
loss → Verlust → Verlust  	low-cost → Niedriglohn → günstigen  	homes → Heimen → Wohnungen  		**Explanation:** "Niedriglohnheimen" (low-wage homes) is a mistranslation of "low-cost homes", changing the intended meaning. The correct translation should emphasize affordability, hence "günstigen Wohnungen" in the reference. Additionally, "Heimen" (homes) is less specific compared to "Wohnungen" (apartments or flats), which fits better in this context. The word “Verlust” is correctly translated, so no error is listed for it.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Despite slight variations in phrasing, the candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The use of "auch" (even) and "bis 2020 auf 500 Haushalte kommen" (come to 500 homes by 2020) maintains the context and intention of the source, fitting within **Acceptable Variations**. Therefore, no single-word translation errors are present.
bonds → Anleihen → Bindungen  	who → die → so  	municipality → Gemeinde → Stadt  		**Explanation:** "Anleihen" (bonds) is less contextually accurate than "Bindungen" in this translation, potentially leading to confusion about the type of bonds discussed. "die" is a mistranslation for expressing "according to" from the source, where "so" captures the intended meaning. "Gemeinde" (municipality) is a broader term compared to "Stadt" (city), which is specifically mentioned in the reference, changing the scope of the entity involved.
**(homes → Häuser → Wohnungen)**		**(price maintenance → Preis-Wartung → Preisbindung)**		**Explanation:**	1. "Häuser" (houses) is a mistranslation of "homes," which should be "Wohnungen" (dwellings, homes) in this context. This error violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Wohnungen" more accurately reflects residential properties in the context of price maintenance.	2. "Preis-Wartung" (price maintenance as in maintenance service) is a mistranslation of "price maintenance," which should be "Preisbindung" (price fixing or control). This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it significantly changes the economic context of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "im Westen der Stadt" (in the west of the city) and "in der Weststadt" (in the West City) effectively convey the same location and meaning in context. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, allowing for acceptable variations that do not change the meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Das Problem ließe sich auf einen Schlag lösen" effectively captures the meaning of the source sentence "The problem could be solved in one fell swoop." The phrase "auf einen Schlag" is an appropriate equivalent for "in one fell swoop." The slight difference in word order between the candidate and reference translations does not affect the meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, there are no meaningful single-word translation errors to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and the reference both convey the same meaning, even though the structure and choice of words differ. The central points: "deadlines/Fristen," "end of the year/Ende des Jahres/Jahresende," and "west of the city/Westen der Stadt/Weststadt" are consistently translated. There is no significant change in meaning that would warrant labeling any word as incorrect.
1800 homes → 1800 Haushalte → 1800 Wohnungen  	affordable housing → bezahlbare Wohngebäude → günstige Wohnungen  		**Explanation:** 		1. "homes" is translated as "Haushalte" (households) instead of the correct "Wohnungen" (apartments). This mismatches the original intent focusing on physical living units rather than the concept of households.	2. "affordable housing" is rendered as "bezahlbare Wohngebäude" (affordable buildings), whereas "günstige Wohnungen" (affordable apartments) more accurately conveys the specific meaning of affordable housing in the context of individual living units.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Das einzige Problem ist, dass ihre Eigentümer, die Wohnungsunternehmen, dagegen sind." matches the intended meaning of the source sentence closely. Although the structure and phrasing differ from the reference, no single words are mistranslated in a way that changes the overall meaning. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
affordable → erschwinglicher → Sozialwohnungen  	blending → Verschnitts → Durchmischung  		**Explanation:**  	- "erschwinglicher" (affordable) is a translation of "affordable" but the reference specifically uses "Sozialwohnungen" (social housing), indicating a more precise type of housing referred to that changes the context.	- "Verschnitts" refers to "blending" as in a mix or blend, but in the context of social housing and city planning, "Durchmischung" (integration/mixing) is the correct term, preserving the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While the candidate translation isn't identical to the reference, it captures the same meaning as the source sentence. Both the candidate and the reference translations avoid concentrating socially disadvantaged people into a small number of areas, complying with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
room → Spielraum → Bewegung		**Explanation:** "Spielraum" (literal translation: leeway or wiggle room) is used here, but the reference and context suggest "Bewegung" (movement), which more accurately reflects the concept of change or adjustment within discussions. This translation doesn't capture the intended meaning, thereby violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
chairman → Fraktionsvorsitzende → Fraktionsvorsitzender  	get into bed → beginnen → ins Boot  		**Explanation:** "Fraktionsvorsitzende" is the wrong form, as it doesn't match the gender implied by "Holger Herlitschke", while "Fraktionsvorsitzender" does. The phrase "beginnen" does not accurately translate to the idiom "get into bed," which is correctly represented by "ins Boot" in the reference, reflecting a collaboration or partnership context.
detached → abgelegene → Einfamilienhäuser		**Explanation:** "abgelegene" (isolated) is a mistranslation of "detached", which refers to "Einfamilienhäuser" (single-family homes or detached homes) in the reference. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it misrepresents the type of homes being discussed. The word "abgelegene" implies a location aspect, rather than the intended architectural style.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although the phrasing differs from the reference translation, it maintains the intended meaning. According to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, acceptable variations do not constitute errors if the meaning is preserved.
worthy → würdige → lohnt  		**Explanation:** "würdige" (worthy) is a mistranslation of "lohnt" (worth it). The intended meaning is that the hunt is valuable or rewarding, which "lohnt" captures more accurately in this context. This adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by focusing on the change in perceived value.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "wie sich die Welt dreht" ("how the world turns") is a valid translation of the source sentence. Although the reference translation used "verändert" ("changes"), both translations convey a similar sense of the world's movement or transformation, fitting within acceptable variations. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as the intended meaning is maintained.
teenagers → Jugendliche → Teenager  	children → Kinder → Kind  	the → die Tatsache → dass  	get outside to play → nicht mehr spielen → zum Spielen nicht mehr nach draußen gehen  	past decade → letzten zehn Jahren → im letzten Jahrzehnt  		**Explanation:**  	- "Jugendliche" is generally acceptable but more commonly refers to young people, whereas "Teenager" specifically targets the English word "teenagers."  	- "Kinder" translates to "children," but the reference translation uses the singular form "Kind," perhaps adhering to stricter translation norms used in the German sentence structure.  	- "die Tatsache" (the fact) as a translation of "the" seems to add unnecessary emphasis not present in the original "that" structure, differing from the meaning conveyed.  	- "nicht mehr spielen" is translated more generally to "no longer play," missing the nuance of "not getting outside to play" present in "zum Spielen nicht mehr nach draußen gehen," which suggests the act of going outside.  	- "letzten zehn Jahren" translates to "past ten years," which is technically correct, but the reference provides "im letzten Jahrzehnt" ("in the past decade"), aligning better with the source's "past decade," maintaining the intent and conciseness.
is getting → lässt → geht es darum  	couch → Regen → Sofa  
television → Videospiele → Fernseher  	initially → zunächst → anfangs  	recently → jüngere → zuletzt  		**Explanation:** "Videospiele" (video games) is incorrectly translated from "television," changing the progression order. "zunächst" (initially) is not translated as "anfangs," which signifies an "at-first" context. "jüngere" (younger) does not properly convey the same temporal progression suggested by "recently."
great → großartig → toll  	being active → aktives Handeln → Aktivitäten  		**Explanation:** "großartig" is a near-synonym of "toll" and generally acceptable, but "aktives Handeln" (active action) is not a faithful translation of "being active" as "Aktivitäten" (activities) is in this context. This misalignment affects the meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
referring → Verrückten → Wahn  	app → Kapp → App  	characters → Charakteristika → Charakteren  	spawned → gegeben → entstanden  	spin offs → Spinnespiele → Spin-Offs  		**Explanation:**  	- "Verrückten" (madman/crazy) is an incorrect translation for "craze," while "Wahn" (craze) accurately conveys this idea, fulfilling the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Kapp" is a mistranslation of "app," likely due to a typo. The correct word is "App," maintaining the idea under the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.	- "Charakteristika" (characteristics) changes the intended meaning of "characters," which should be translated as "Charakteren," following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "gegeben" (given) does not convey the idea of something being "spawned," while "entstanden" (emerged) matches the context better.	- "Spinnespiele" (spider games) is a mistranslation of "spin offs," with "Spin-Offs" (borrowed directly) being the correct translation, adhering to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
off the boil → vom Bock verschwunden → sank das Interesse  		**Explanation:** The phrase "gone off the boil" is mistranslated as "vom Bock verschwunden" ("disappeared from the goat"), which is incorrect and nonsensical in this context. The intended meaning relates to a decrease in interest or enthusiasm, reflected as "sank das Interesse" in the reference. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by highlighting the specific mistranslation of an idiomatic expression.
response → Reaktion → Nachfrage  	launch → Start → Markteinführung  	overloaded → überladen → überlastete  		**Explanation:** "Reaktion" (reaction) is a mistranslation of "response" in this context, as "Nachfrage" (demand) more accurately captures the intended meaning. "Start" (start) is a mistranslation of "launch," where "Markteinführung" (market introduction) better fits the context. Lastly, "überladen" (loaded/overloaded) should be "überlastete" (overloaded/overstrained) for accuracy, maintaining the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation provides an accurate and understandable rendering of the source sentence. The phrases "innerhalb von Tagen" (within days) and "innerhalb weniger Tage" (within a few days) convey essentially the same idea, and both "Nutzer" and "Benutzer" (users) are acceptable synonyms in German. Therefore, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, no significant translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Wie funktioniert es also?" includes the word "also" at the beginning. While it appears superfluous compared to the reference translation "Wie funktioniert es?", both sentences effectively convey the same information. The inclusion of "also" does not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence in this context, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, there are no significant single-word translation errors.
screening → Screening → Screenshot  		**Explanation:** "Screening" is a mistranslation of "screenshot". "Screening" does not convey the same digital action of capturing an image on a phone screen, creating a significant meaning change, as outlined in the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
- craze → Riss → Wahn	- jumping → auf die Suche geschoben → sprang	- couch → Suche → Sofa		**Explanation:** "Riss" (crack) is a mistranslation of "craze", which significantly changes the meaning. "auf die Suche geschoben" (pushed onto the search) is a mistranslation of "jumping off the couch", altering the intended action. "Suche" (search) is used incorrectly here in place of "Sofa" (couch), so it is listed as well. Each of these errors violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** or **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Every word and phrase in the candidate translation is correctly aligned with the source and reference sentences in terms of meaning and context. The terms "durchschnittliche" and "Durchschnittsperson" both are valid interpretations of "average person," and while the structure and some word choices differ, such as "erheblich gestiegen" vs. "beträchtlichen Anstieg," these differences do not significantly change the meaning. Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no translation errors are detected.
Cardiogram → Cardiff → Cardiogram  	App → Papp → App  	tracks → verfolgt → nachverfolgt  	exercise → ausübten → trainieren  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Cardiogram" is mistranslated as "Cardiff," which is a significant error because it changes the subject entirely and violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	2. "App" is mistranslated as "Papp," which is meaningless in the context of the source content. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	3. "tracks" is translated as "verfolgt," which implies tracking in a potentially negative or incorrect manner. "Nachverfolgt" is more appropriate as it means "to monitor" in line with the app's functionality.	4. "exercise" is translated as "ausübten," which is not specific or appropriate in this context where "trainieren" (to train or exercise) is a more precise match, violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the meaning of the source sentence despite differences in phrasing. Both "sieht nur rohe Daten auf Bewegungsstufen" and "sieht lediglich die Rohdaten zur Leistungssteigerung" convey the concept of viewing raw data related to some form of physical activity, meeting the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule by not significantly altering the intended meaning.
1. off the couch → sich verabschieden → vom Sofa	2. everyday → aktiv → jeden Tag		**Explanation:** 	1. "sich verabschieden" (to say goodbye) is a mistranslation of "get off the couch," significantly changing the intended call to action. Hence, "sich verabschieden" is replaced with the targeted phrase "vom Sofa."	2. "aktiv" (to be active) mistranslates "everyday". The emphasis in the source is on the frequency "every day," while "aktiv" focuses on the action rather than the frequency. This changes the intended message timing aspect. Thus, "aktiv" is replaced by "jeden Tag" to correctly capture the habitual aspect in the source sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence, maintaining the emphasis on the significance of exercise not being undervalued. The structure and terminology differ from the reference, but the essential meaning remains intact, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
exercise → tätig → Sport  	reduce → verringern → reduziert  	chances → Chancen → Risiko  		**Explanation:** "tätig" (engaged/active) is a mistranslation of "exercise," which alters the specific focus on physical activity. This highlights the importance of matching the source's intended activity in the target language. "verringern" (lower) does not fully capture the more active "reduce" as in "rediziert" in the reference, being a significant verb choice. "Chancen" implies 'chances' but contextually is more naturally expressed by "Risiko" (risk) in the context of health issues, aligning with the intention of reducing the risk of diseases.
1. Activity → Aktivitäten → Körperliche Betätigung	2. management → Management → Kontrolle	3. high → (missing) → hohem	4. benefits → Leistungen → Vorteilen  	5. too long to list → aufgelistet werden können → zu lange ist, um sie hier anzuführen		**Explanation:**  	1. "Aktivitäten" (activities) is a mistranslation of "Activity" which, in the context of the sentence, aligns more with "Körperliche Betätigung" (physical activity).	2. "Management" does not accurately translate "control" in the context of weight management and should be "Kontrolle".	3. The word "high" is missing in the candidate translation, which leads to a change in meaning, as "Blutdruck" (blood pressure) does not specify that it is "high blood pressure".	4. "Leistungen" (services/achievements) is a mistranslation of "benefits", which should be "Vorteilen" in this context.	5. The phrase "aufgelistet werden können" (can be listed) changes the intended meaning of "too long to list", making it a mistranslation that impacts comprehension.
people → Menschen → Leute  	outside → nicht → im Freien  	enjoy → genießen → Spaß  		**Explanation:** 	- "Menschen" (people) is generally acceptable but "Leute" fits more closely with the reference. Given the significant error with "nicht," this helps clarify context.	- "nicht" (not) is an incorrect addition, as it fundamentally changes the sentence's meaning. It contradicts the idea presented in both the source and reference that people do enjoy the activity.	- "genießen" (enjoy) is a closer mistranslation in this altered context because of the forced negative, though it originally fits. In proper context, should align with "Spaß macht" (fun/make them enjoy it). Here, "enjoy" should be represented by how it conveys "fun" in English within context.
(Sunshine → Sonne → Sonnenschein)		**Explanation:** "Sonne" (sun) is a mistranslation of "sunshine" in this context. According to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, this changes the intended focus from general sun to the more specific concept of "sunshine," which relates to health benefits. The words for "thus" and "covering" are valid in the context, and the conjunctions used ("und" vs "sowie") don't significantly alter the meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "Einige Leute" and "Manche Leute" are valid translations of "Some people". "machen neue Freunde" is contextually similar to "schließen neue Freundschaften", retaining the meaning of forming new friendships. The phrase "bei der Jagd" and "auf der Jagd" both accurately convey "on the hunt". The translation captures the intended meaning, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
po-faced → Demagogen → mürrische  	killjoys → Demagogen → Spielverderber  		**Explanation:** "Demagogen" (demagogues) is a mistranslation of both "po-faced" and "killjoys" which are translated in the reference as "mürrische" (sulky or sullen) and "Spielverderber" (killjoys, spoilsports), respectively. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it changes the nature of the individuals described from being grumpy and spoiling fun to being deceitful leaders.
somebody → jemand → jemand  	walk → gehen → laufen		**Explanation:** "jemand" is correctly translated and thus no error should be noted. However, "gehen" (to go/walk) should be replaced with "laufen" (to run/walk into, in the sense of colliding with). Since I am focusing on single-word errors, "walk into" is reduced to "walk", and the correct word in this context is "laufen", aligning with the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Was also?" serves as an acceptable alternative to express the sentiment "So what?" in German, despite differing from the reference translation "Was soll's?". This aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as the meaning remains contextually intact.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Ein Durchbruch ist eingetreten" accurately conveys the same meaning as the source sentence "A breakthrough has occurred." Although the structure differs slightly from the reference translation, the key elements, such as "Durchbruch" (breakthrough), align correctly and maintain the intended meaning. Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no translation errors are identified.
Smartphone → Smarttpapiere → Smartphone  	exercise → tun → Sport treiben  		**Explanation:** "Smarttpapiere" is a mistranslation of "smartphone apps" and significantly changes the meaning since "Smarttpapiere" is nonsensical in this context. Likewise, "tun" aligns with "do" and does not convey the intended meaning "exercise," which is more accurately captured by "Sport treiben" in the reference translation.
novelty → Neuheit → Neue  	wear off → ausbreiten → seinen Reiz verlieren  		**Explanation:** "Neuheit" (novelty) does not capture the intended sense of freshness fading, which "Neue" (newness) or a similar concept would better represent. "Ausbreiten" (spread) is a mistranslation of "wear off", which should convey the diminishing interest or charm, best captured by "seinen Reiz verlieren" (lose its charm). The mistranslations significantly alter the intended meaning, requiring correction as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
Pokmeon's → Pokmeon → Pokemons  	games → Spielchen → Spiele  	apps → Kappen → Apps  	being → aktivem Handeln → Aktivwerden  	people → Menschen → Leuten  	fitter → besser → fitter  		**Explanation:**  	- "Pokmeon" is a misspelling of "Pokémon" in the source sentence, which the candidate further mistakenly uses instead of the genitive form "Pokemons".	- "Spielchen" (diminutive of "games") downplays the significance compared to "Spiele", violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Kappen" (caps) is a mistranslation of "apps", which violates **Identify Mistranslations**.	- "aktivem Handeln" (active actions) doesn't accurately capture "being active", necessitating a correction to "Aktivwerden".	- "Menschen" (humans/people) is a more general term compared to "Leuten" but is contextually fine; however, for strict adherence to correct translation, "Leuten" is specified.	- "besser" (better) is a mistranslation of "fitter", which changes the health-related intent of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The primary difference between "die Blogs von" and "Dr. Joes Blog" is not substantial enough to be considered a significant mistranslation as both convey reading blog content associated with Dr. Joe. Additionally, the prepositions "in" and "auf" can both contextually fit the website reference, maintaining the intended meaning. This aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
Biles → Billes → Biles  	nails → schneidet → schafft  	all-around → (omitted) → im Damenturnen  	gymnastics → Gymnastikum → Turnen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Billes" is a mistranslation or typo for "Biles". This is a **prioritize meaningful error** as it inaccurately represents the athlete's name.	- "schneidet" (cuts) is a mistranslation of "nails" (achieves with precision), which is a significant error under **ensure contextual accuracy**, as it changes the meaning.	- "all-around" is omitted, affecting the meaning of achieving gold in the "all-around" event, recognized under **focus on single-word errors**, though omission is noted rather than translated differently.	- "Gymnastikum" is not a standard term for "gymnastics" in German, whereas "Turnen" is correctly used and is thus an error as per **ensure contextual accuracy**.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation matches the reference translation word for word, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, with no significant change in meaning. Hence, no translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Simone Biles ist gegen all das immun" is a valid translation of "Simone Biles is immune to all of it." The difference between "gegen" (against) and "auf" (on) in this context does not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where both translations are acceptable.
vault → Vault → Sprungpferd  		**Explanation:** In the context of gymnastics, "vault" refers to "Sprungpferd", a specific apparatus. The German word "Vault" could be understood as referring to an unspecified or incorrectly specified term, rather than the intended gymnastic apparatus. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes the context from a specific gymnastics term to a more generic or misinterpreted one.
effortless → Unnachgiebigkeit → Mühelos  	beam → Bett → Balken  		**Explanation:** "Unnachgiebigkeit" (unyieldingness) is a clear mistranslation of "effortless," changing the meaning significantly and violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Bett" (bed) is an incorrect translation of "beam," which alters the sentence contextually, as specified by the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
jaw-dropping → zu fallen → atemberaubend		**Explanation:** "zu fallen" (to fall) is a mistranslation of "jaw-dropping" in this context. "Jaw-dropping" implies amazement or astonishment, which is correctly captured by "atemberaubend" (breathtaking) in the reference translation. This error is identified as it significantly changes the meaning, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Überall brillant" and the reference translation "Auf ganzer Linie brilliant" both convey the general meaning of "Brilliant all over". This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as both translations are contextually acceptable and retain the intended meaning without significant deviation.
finally → zum Schluss → endlich  	champion → Verfechter → Olympiasiegerin  		**Explanation:**  	- "zum Schluss" (at the end) is a mistranslation of "finally". It does not convey the same sense of culmination after a series of events, which "endlich" (finally) does.	- "Verfechter" (advocate) is a mistranslation of "champion". While "Verfechter" can imply someone who supports a cause, in this context, it fails to convey the meaning of "Olympiasiegerin" (Olympic champion), which implies someone who has won. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
1. gymnast → Gymnasmus → Turnerin  	2. soared → nahm → erklomm  	3. all-around → den ganzen → Mehrkampftitel  	4. putting → stellte → vergrößerte  	5. herself → ihr → sich  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Gymnasmus" does not exist in German. The correct translation for "gymnast" in this context is "Turnerin".	2. "nahm" (took) changes the sense of the sentence compared to "soared" which implies excellence or success in achieving something. The correct term is "erklomm" (climbed to).	3. "den ganzen Titel" (the whole title) is a mistranslation of "all-around title", which has a specific meaning in gymnastics competitions. The correct term is "Mehrkampftitel" (all-around title).	4. "stellte" (set or presented) shifts the meaning from increasing the gap, as intended by "putting the gap on full display", to merely presenting the gap. The reference uses "vergrößerte" (increased), which better captures the intended nuance.	5. "ihr" (her) is incorrect compared to "herself" which should be reflexive in this context, with "sich" being the proper reflexive pronoun in German.
silver medalist → Silbermedialismus → Silbermedaillengewinner  	teammate → Teamat → Mannschaftskameradin  	medalist → Medialist → Medaillengewinner  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Silbermedialismus" (silver medialism) is a mistranslation of "silver medalist". It alters the intended meaning since it does not refer to an individual who received a medal.	2. "Teamat" (teammat) is an incorrect term for "teammate". The correct translation reflecting the context is "Mannschaftskameradin".	3. "Medialist" (medialist) is a mistranslation of "medalist". It should be "Medaillengewinner" to accurately convey an individual who earned a medal. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
balance beam → Gleichgewicht → Schwebebalken  	performs → behaftet → turnt  	all-around final → Gymnastikerinnen → Einzelmehrkampffinale  		**Explanation:**  	- "Gleichgewicht" (balance) is a mistranslation of "balance beam", which specifically refers to a gymnastics apparatus, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "behaftet" (afflicted) does not contextually fit the action of performing on a balance beam and is a mistranslation of "performs", violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Gymnastikerinnen" attempts to paraphrase "women's individual all-around final" but does not specify the event's nature and focus. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by changing the context to merely women gymnasts without an event.
Biles → Bilder → Biles  	fourth → einfachen → vierten  	straight → einfachen → heterosexuelle  	woman → Frau → Amerikanerin  	all-around → ganzen → Mehrkampftitel  	her → Generation → ihrer  	ever → je → überhaupt  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Biles" was mistranslated as "Bilder" (images), which is incorrect. This violates the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule as the context clearly refers to a person's name.	2. "fourth" was mistranslated as "einfachen" (simple). This misleadingly changes the count in the context.	3. "straight" was mistranslated as "einfachen" (simple), which changes the nature of the achievement. "heterosexuelle" is used in the reference, though interpretive, it maintains the context more closely.	4. "woman" was mistranslated simply as "Frau" (woman) without capturing the specific context of being an American. The reference translation merged this with "Amerikanerin".	5. "all-around" was mistranslated as "ganzen" (whole). This fails to convey the specific meaning of the "Mehrkampftitel" (all-around title) in gymnastics.	6. "her" was mistranslated as "Generation" (generation), a serious contextual error as it confuses the subject with an object.	7. "ever" was mistranslated as "je" (yes) when it should have been "überhaupt" to capture the intended meaning of "ever in history".
final total → endgültige Gesamtbeschäftigung → Endergebnis  		**Explanation:** "endgültige Gesamtbeschäftigung" (final employment) is a mistranslation of "final total", which significantly alters the intended meaning. "Endergebnis" (final result) is the correct reference here. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "total" is translated incorrectly.
achievement → Errungenschaft → Erfolg  	athletes → Sportler → Athleten  	generation → Generation → einzigartige  	Phelps → Phils → Phelps  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Errungenschaft" translates to "achievement" but is different from the reference "Erfolg" (success). While close in meaning, "Erfolg" better matches the original "achievement" contextually by emphasizing success.  	2. "Sportler" (sportsmen) is used instead of "Athleten" (athletes), which is the appropriate translation in this context.	3. "Generation" directly translates from the candidate word used, but "einzigartige" (unique) captures the idea of being "once-in-a-generation," which reflects the concept of rarity or uniqueness.	4. "Phils" is a typo or error for "Phelps," which does not align with the reference name.
Biles → Bildschirmen → Biles  	sport → Bildschirmen → Sportart  	Retton → Rollon → Retton  	gymnast → Spitzfindigkeit → Turnerin  		**Explanation:**  	- "Biles" was mistranslated as "Bildschirmen" (screens), which is clearly incorrect and changes the subject of the sentence, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "sport" was also mistranslated as "Bildschirmen". The intended subject is related to athletics, not screens.	- "Retton" was mistranslated as "Rollon", which is a name error. This violates the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as personal names should remain consistent.	- "gymnast" was mistranslated as "Spitzfindigkeit" (subtlety, sophistication), which does not convey the intended meaning of a female athlete in gymnastics, significantly altering the context and violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
test → Prüfung → Prüfung  	contest → Wettstreit → Wettbewerb  	field → Bereich → Rest der Athleten  		**Explanation:**  	1. The candidate translation uses "Prüfung" for "test," which is correct given the context and aligns with the reference translation.	2. "Wettstreit" for "contest" is a reasonable translation choice, although "Wettbewerb" from the reference suggests a common term. However, both share similar meanings, thus not significantly altering the sentence's meaning. Still, it's noted as a different term choice.	3. "Bereich" for "field," literally translates as "area" or "field" in a less specific sense. The reference uses "Rest der Athleten," which is more contextually aligned to "the rest of the field" in sports, meaning athletes explicitly. Thus, "Bereich" is deemed an error in the context of sports competition.		**Note:** "Oversized" translation was not flagged since "überdimensionierter" and "übermäßiger" both capture the intended meaning in context.
**(Spring → Frühjahr → Spring)**		**Explanation:** "Frühjahr" (spring) is a mistranslation of "Spring" (the name of a place). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it incorrectly interprets "Spring" as the season rather than a location. The significant error here is not distinguishing between the proper noun "Spring" and the common noun "Frühjahr".
United States → Vereinigten Staaten → Amerikanerinnen  	left → zurückgelassen → links  	embrace → akzeptieren → umarmen  	artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final → künstlerischen Gymnastikerinnen → Einzelmehrkampffinale der Frauen im Kunstturnen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Vereinigten Staaten" translates to "United States," but in context, the source refers to the individuals from the USA, hence "Amerikanerinnen" (Americans) is correct.	2. "zurückgelassen" (left behind) is a mistranslation of "left" in this context, where it means "on the left" as a descriptor for Simone Biles in the picture or event order.	3. "akzeptieren" (accept) is a mistranslation of "embrace," which should be "umarmen" meaning to hug, which significantly alters the meaning.	4. "künstlerischen Gymnastikerinnen" (artistic gymnasts) does not accurately capture "artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final," which is a specific event, properly translated as "Einzelmehrkampffinale der Frauen im Kunstturnen."
Biles → Bilanzen → Biles  	exclamation → Ausgangspunkt → Ausrufezeichen  	going away → weggezogene → Abschieds  	party → Partei → Feier  		**Explanation:**  	- "Biles" is mistranslated as "Bilanzen," which is incorrect in this context as it refers to a name rather than a financial statement.	- "exclamation" is mistranslated as "Ausgangspunkt" (starting point), which changes the meaning of the sentence. The correct translation is "Ausrufezeichen."	- "going away" is mistranslated as "weggezogene" (pulled away), which incorrectly changes the context to physical movement rather than a farewell. The correct reference word is "Abschieds."	- "party" is mistranslated as "Partei" (political party), altering the intended idea of a social gathering. The correct translation is "Feier."
Biles → Biles → Biles		ahead → nach vorn → die Zukunft		long run → langen Laufzeit → langen Wegs auf die Spitze		true → nicht → wirklich wahr		**Explanation:**  	- "Biles" is correctly translated and does not need changes. It is used here to fit the output format requirement, although it is correct.	- The word "ahead" mistranslated as "nach vorn", which is more about physical direction rather than planning, in contrast to the intended meaning of "the future" or "planning ahead" as in "die Zukunft".	- "long run" translated as "langen Laufzeit", which implies duration technically, but in context "langen Wegs auf die Spitze" (long way to the top) captures the intended journey or effort better.	- "not exactly true" translated as "stimmt das nicht", omitting the nuance of "exactly" or "really" in "nicht wirklich wahr".
portion → Fußbodens → Teil  	exercise routine → Unterschriftenumschlag → Übungen  	signature → Unterschriftenumschlag → typischen  	tumbling → Unterschriftenumschlag → Tumbling  	pass → Unterschriftenumschlag → Pass  	Latin → lateinische → lateinamerikanische  	fit → angebracht → passen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Fußbodens" (floor) is a mistranslation of "portion," which implies a segment or part of a routine, not a literal floor, as indicated in the reference.  	- "Unterschriftenumschlag" (envelope) incorrectly translates the compound idea of "exercise routine," "signature," "tumbling," and "pass." Each of these has distinct meanings related to gymnastics, which are lost in "Unterschriftenumschlag."  	- "lateinische" (Latin) disregards the context of "Latin American" music used in sports or cultural activities.  	- "angebracht" (appropriate) changes the context, as "passen" (fit) directly links to the conceptual suitability of the music for the location outside the arena.
No translation errors detected.
1. toddler → Todler → kleines Kind  	2. coach → Bus → Trainerin  	3. field trip → Feldfahrt → Schulausflug  	4. gym → Gym → Turnhalle  	5. force → Truppe → Kraft  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Todler" is a misspelling of "toddler" and doesn't exist in German, whereas "kleines Kind" accurately conveys the meaning.	2. "Bus" (bus) is a mistranslation of "coach" in this context since it should refer to a trainer, represented by "Trainerin".	3. "Feldfahrt" is incorrect for "field trip". The correct term is "Schulausflug".	4. "Gym" is incorrectly unchanged from English; the correct German term is "Turnhalle".	5. "Truppe" (troop) is a mistranslation of "force", which in context should be "Kraft", meaning strength or power.
all-around → umgekehrten → Mehrkampfwettbewerb  		**Explanation:** "umgekehrten" (reversed) mistranslates "all-around," which in this context refers to a type of competition (Mehrkampfwettbewerb). This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it completely changes the type of competition being described.
lead → Führung → führte  	mirage → Illusion → trügte das Bild  		**Explanation:** The word "lead" in the context of competition is better translated as "führte", which captures the temporary nature of the advantage in competition. "Führung" could imply a more stable position of leadership rather than a specific lead. "Mirage" is better translated as "trügte das Bild", capturing the deceptive nature of the lead. "Illusion" can work in some contexts, but "trügte das Bild" conveys the intended meaning more accurately here.
balance beam → bam → Schwebebalken  	defending → Verteidiger → Weltmeistertitel  	lay in wait → wartete → lauerten  		**Explanation:**  	- "bam" is a mistranslation of "balance beam," violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Verteidiger der Welt" (defender of the world) is a mistranslation for "defending world champion"; "Weltmeistertitel" correctly conveys Biles' status. This adheres to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** by isolating "Verteidiger."	- "wartete" (waited) does not capture the connotation of "lay in wait," which is more accurately translated as "lauerten," as per **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.
1. beam → Bett → Schwebebalken  	2. capped → kappte → setzte  		**Explanation:**  	- "Bett" (bed) is a mistranslation of "beam" (Schwebebalken) which is a piece of gymnastics equipment, not a bed.	- "kappte" (cut) does not accurately translate "capped," which in this context means to finish or complete with a score. "Setzte" is a better fit here to convey the intended action of achieving the final result.
(her → sie → ihr)  	(hugged → umgehängt → umarmte)  	(gently → vorsichtig → sanft)  	(score → Ergebnis → Endergebnis)  	(scrapbook → Schraubbuch → Sammelbuch)  	(glittery → blauen → glänzend)  	(eyeliner → Augeliner → Eyeliner)  		**Explanation:**  	1. "her → sie → ihr": The source word "her" intended to associate possessively with the final score, which "ihr" correctly does in German. "sie" does not reflect this possessiveness.	2. "hugged → umgehängt → umarmte": "Umgehängt" implies "hung" or "sling" rather than "hugged", which changes the action meaningfully. "Umarmte" is the correct translation.	3. "gently → vorsichtig → sanft": "Vorsichtig" is "carefully", which changes the nuance compared to "gently" (sanft).	4. "score → Ergebnis → Endergebnis": "Ergebnis" is "result", whereas "Endergebnis" is "final score", maintaining specificity.	5. "scrapbook → Schraubbuch → Sammelbuch": "Schraubbuch" suggests a screw book, likely a translation error for "scrapbook", which should be "Sammelbuch".	6. "glittery → blauen → glänzend": The word "blauen" represents "blue", which incorrectly captures the intended "glittery" (glänzend) aspect of the eyeliner.	7. "eyeliner → Augeliner → Eyeliner": "Augeliner" is a misspelling or incorrect adaptation of "Eyeliner", which remains the same in both languages.
Raisman's → von Raisman → Raismans  	tiebreaker → Bandbrecher → Tiebrake  		**Explanation:** "von Raisman" is grammatically incorrect here, as the correct genitive form "Raismans" should be used to show possession relating to "performance". "Bandbrecher" is a mistranslation of "tiebreaker". The word refers to something breaking a band or a ribbon, not a method for settling ties in competitions, which is what "Tiebrake" represents.
captain → Mannschaftsmann → Mannschaftskapitänin  	grandma → Enkelma → Oma  		**Explanation:** "Mannschaftsmann" (team man) is a mistranslation of "team captain," which changes the role of the person mentioned. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule. "Enkelma" (likely intending a derivative of "grandmother") is incorrect for "grandma," which is commonly translated as "Oma." This violates both the **Identify Mistranslations** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
kisses → blühte → Kusshände  	floor → Ereignis → Bodenübung  	comeback → Umweg → Comeback  		**Explanation:** 	- "blühte" (bloomed) is a mistranslation of "kisses"; it significantly alters the meaning since "blühte" does not convey the intended action of throwing kisses.	- "Ereignis" (event) is a mistranslation of "floor"; while both relate to events, the reference context specifically mentions a floor routine.	- "Umweg" (detour) is a mistranslation of "comeback"; it changes the intended meaning significantly because a "comeback" suggests recovery or return, which is lost in translation with "Umweg".
19-year-old's → 19-jährige → 19-Jährigen  	viral → Virnetrot → sich schnell ausbreitende  		**Explanation:** "19-jährige" needs to reflect the genitive case "der 19-Jährigen" to convey the correct grammatical relationship. "Virnetrot" is not a recognized German term for "viral"; "sich schnell ausbreitende" accurately reflects the intended meaning, changing the contextual understanding of the sentence.
3 → schweren → Serienmörderfall		**Explanation:** "schweren" (serious) is a mistranslation of "serial killer", which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence by omitting the key detail about the serial killer.
two → zwei → zwei  	12-year-old → zwölfjähriges → 12-Jahre altes  	police → Polizeiberichten → Polizeiberichten  	reports → Berichten → Berichten  	Thursday → Donnerstag → Donnerstag  	deadliest → tödlichsten → tödlichsten  	attack → Attentat → Angriffe  	car → Auto → Auto  	talking → sprach → unterhielten  	music → Musik → Musik  	shot → erschossen → erschossen		**Explanation:**		1. **attack → Attentat → Angriffe**: "Attentat" means "assassination" or "attempt", which is not accurate for "attack" in this context. The correct word should be "Angriffe" which aligns with the reference translation.	2. **talking → sprach → unterhielten**: "sprach" translates to "spoke" and does not capture the action of "talking" between people inside the car; "unterhielten" (conversed) fits this context better.		The other words listed as triples are noted to demonstrate alignment between the candidate and reference translations. However, "attack" and "talking" are the only significant errors per the task's guidelines.
driveway → Fahrt → Einfahrt		**Explanation:** The word "Fahrt" (journey/drive) is a mistranslation of "driveway", which changes the location context of where the car was parked, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Einfahrt" (driveway) is the correct translation.
gunman → Schusswaffe → Täter  	handgun → Handfeuer → Handfeuerwaffe  	passenger → Passagierseite → Beifahrerseite  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Schusswaffe" (firearm) is a mistranslation of "gunman". In context, "Täter" (perpetrator) is more accurate, as it refers to the person performing the action, not the weapon.	2. "Handfeuer" (hand-firearm) is an incorrect translation for "handgun". The correct term should be "Handfeuerwaffe" (handgun), a precise firearm term.	3. "Passagierseite" (passenger side) doesn't accurately convey the specific context that "Beifahrerseite" (passenger side as in the 'front seat' of a car) holds, which is used in the reference translation.
purses → Geldkassen → Handtaschen  		**Explanation:** "Geldkassen" (cash registers or cash boxes) is a mistranslation of "purses". The source word refers to personal accessory bags, such as handbags or purses, which in German is "Handtaschen". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Geldkassen" does not fit the context of personal possessions in a robbery.
shooting → Schießungen → Schießerei  		**Explanation:** "Schießungen" (shootings) is a mistranslation of "shooting", which was singular in the source. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the number discrepancy can change the understanding of the event described.
people → Menschen → Personen  	Hispanic neighborhoods → spanischen Nachbarn → hispanischen Wohngegenden  		**Explanation:** "Menschen" is a less precise translation for "people" compared to "Personen" in this context. Despite being a minor precision error, it's noted because it aligns better with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Nachbarn" (neighbors) is a mistranslation of "neighborhoods" and significantly alters the meaning. The correct translation, "Wohngegenden", refers to residential areas, maintaining alignment with the source and reference sentences.
Howard → Herr → Howard  	affiliate → Freund → Tochtergesellschaft  		**Explanation:** 	- "Herr" (Mr.) is a mistranslation of "Howard." While "Herr" can be used for "Mr.," it doesn't correspond to the name "Howard," thus changing the subject of the statement and violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Freund" (friend) is a mistranslation of "affiliate." "Affiliate" in this context refers to a business relation like a subsidiary or partner (in the broadcasting industry), and "friend" changes the nature of the relationship significantly. This identifies it as a single-word error based on the translation's meaning.
several → mehrere → mehrere → mehrere  		**Explanation:** "Dem Verdächtigen zufolge" (according to the suspect) is a mistranslation of "The suspect is believed" which results in a significant change in meaning. The mistranslation centers on the expression of belief or assumption about the suspect's behavior.
declined → abgelehnt → weigerten  	reveal → aufzudecken → offenzulegen  	evidence → Beweise → die Beweise  	conclude → Abschluss → Schlußfolgerung  	attacks → Anschläge → Angriffe  	related → in Verbindung gebracht → verknüpft  		**Explanation:**  	- "abgelehnt" (declined) does not capture the refusal aspect of "weigerten".	- "aufzudecken" (uncover) is not as precise as "offenzulegen" (reveal), missing the sense of making something known.	- "Beweise" (evidence) lacks the definite article "die" in its reference translation form, making it less precise.	- "Abschluss" (conclusion) in general sense differs from "Schlußfolgerung" (inference/conclusion based on reasoning).	- "Anschläge" (assaults) carries a slightly more violent connotation than "Angriffe" (attacks), impacting the interpretation.	- "in Verbindung gebracht" (associated) misses the connotation of being inherently "verknüpft" (linked) or connected.
hospitalized → ins Krankenhaus gesteckt → hospitalisiert		**Explanation:** "ins Krankenhaus gesteckt" (put into the hospital) is an informal and incorrect translation of "hospitalized". The formal process of hospitalization is best captured by "hospitalisiert", which matches the intended meaning, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Liner → Linner → Liner		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Linner," which is a mistranslation of "Liner." This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by incorrectly altering a proper noun, significantly affecting the clarity of the sentence.
parked → Parkauto → geparkten  		**Explanation:** "Parkauto" (parking car) is a mistranslation of "parked car", which is supposed to refer to a car that is parked, not a car meant for parking. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, where "Parkauto" doesn't match the contextual meaning intended in "geparkten Auto".
pickup truck → Kinderwagen → Pickup-Truck  	shooting → Schuss → Schießerei  	killing → Töten → Mord  		**Explanation:** "Kinderwagen" (stroller) is a mistranslation of "pickup truck," significantly altering the object targeted by the shooting. "Schuss" (shot) inaccurately translates "shooting," which in this context refers to an event involving gunfire, not just an individual shot. "Töten" (killing) is less specific than "Mord" (murder), which is a significant error because it changes the legal implication of the crime.
bullet casings → Kugelsäcke → Patronenhülsen  		**Explanation:** "Kugelsäcke" translates to "bullet bags," which significantly changes the intended meaning since "Patronenhülsen" (bullet casings) is the correct term for the metal parts left after bullets are fired. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by fundamentally altering the context of what was recovered.
6-year-old → sechs Jahren → 6-Jährigen  	microcephaly → Mikrokophalie → Mikrozephalie  		**Explanation:** "sechs Jahren" (six years) is a mistranslation of "6-year-old", which in this context would be better translated as "6-Jährigen" (6-year-old child). The word "Mikrokophalie" is a typo and incorrect version of "microcephaly", which should be translated as "Mikrozephalie".
singing → Liebe → das Singen  		**Explanation:** "Liebe" (love) is a mistranslation of "singing". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it disrupts the intended items of affection. The other words in the candidate sentence either align or are acceptable variations according to the guidelines.
1. unlike → im Gegensatz zu → wie die wenigsten	2. peers → Mitstreiter → Altergenossen	3. mom → sein Mom → Mutter	4. pregnant → seiner Schwangerschaft → ihrer Schwangerschaft		**Explanation:** 	- "unlike" is mistranslated as "im Gegensatz zu" instead of the intended contrastive meaning "wie die wenigsten."	- "peers" is translated as "Mitstreiter" which conveys a sense of "comrades" or "colleagues" rather than "Altergenossen" (age-mates or peers in the sense of people of the same age group).	- "mom" should be "Mutter" as "sein Mom" is an incorrect mix of possessive pronouns and does not fit standard German structure.	- "pregnant" is contextualized incorrectly with "seiner Schwangerschaft," which uses the wrong possessive pronoun. The correct context is "ihrer Schwangerschaft," referring to the mother being pregnant.
came → kam → kam (no error here as both candidate and reference use "kam," which aligns with the source meaning)	first → ersten → das erste (This does not change the meaning substantially when interpreted in context for time expression, so no reportable error)	initial → [omitted] → erster (This is the key error as "initial thought" is omitted, changing the meaning by excluding the internal reaction or sentiment part of the thought process)		**(initial → [omitted] → erster)**  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation omits the equivalent of "initial" ("erster"), which significantly changes the meaning by not conveying the temporal aspect of the thought. This follows the **Identify Mistranslations** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both the candidate translation "Das kann ich nicht" and the reference translation "Ich schaffe das nicht" correctly convey the meaning of the source sentence "I can't do this." Although the phrasing differs, both translations accurately reflect the inability to perform the task, complying with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Thus, there are no significant single-word translation errors.
I → Ich → Darauf  	sign up → unterschrieben → eingelassen  		**Explanation:** "Ich" (I) is a mistranslation of "Darauf" (for this), and "unterschrieben" (signed) is a mistranslation of "eingelassen" (signed up for), which changes the meaning of the sentence significantly. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, as the candidate translation incorrectly focuses on signing rather than the broader concept of engagement or involvement.
1. which → Das → Was	2. sign up → unterschreiben → sich darauf eingelassen		**Explanation:**	1. "Das" (that) is a mistranslation of "which". The correct translation in the context of the given sentence is "Was".	2. "unterschreiben" (sign) is a mistranslation of "sign up". The correct expression in this context is "sich darauf eingelassen" (engaged in it), which better captures the intended meaning of enrolling or participating.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, aligning with the reference in significant respects. The use of phrases like "vielleicht nie erkennen" and "vielleicht nicht einmal überleben" matches the intent of uncertainty and potential outcomes without significant deviations in meaning, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The words "Einige" (some), "Ärzte" (doctors), "vorgeschlagen" (suggesting), and "eine Institutionalisierung" (institutionalized) all convey the intended meaning of the source sentence. While there are structural differences between the candidate and reference translations, the meaning remains intact, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Thus, no errors are reported.
1. first → erste → erste/erste (no significant error, correct translation)	2. response → Antwort → Antwort (no significant error, correct translation)	3. didn't → dachte nicht → wusste nicht  	4. people → die Menschen → Leute  	5. anymore → mehr → noch immer		**Explanation:**	- "dachte nicht" (thought not) does not fully capture the assertion level of "didn't think", which "wusste nicht" (didn't know) does more accurately, impacting meaning.	- "die Menschen" (the people) is a more formal version and misses the casual, general reference that "Leute" (people) provides.	- "mehr" (anymore) as a negative does not completely align with "noch immer" (still) to indicate that the action continues to happen, which changes the implication in the context.
help → Hilfe → Hilfe  	walker → Walkers → Gehhilfe  		**Explanation:** The word "Hilfe" is correctly translated but remains within the context, so it doesn't warrant listing. However, "Walkers" in the candidate translation should be replaced with "Gehhilfe," which is the correct translation for "walker." The mistranslation significantly alters the meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Additionally, the candidate version uses "Walker" which is treated as a name rather than the intended mobility aid.
sit up → ist gewesen → sitzen  	crawl → gewesen → krabbeln  	talk → redet → sprechen  	Edmund didn't sit up or crawl until he was three → Edmund ist erst drei gewesen, und er → Edmund konnte bis zu seinem dritten Lebensjahr weder sitzen noch krabbeln und er  		**Explanation:**		1. **sit up → ist gewesen → sitzen**: "ist gewesen" (has been) does not convey the action or ability of "sitting up" that is present in the source. "Sit up" should be "sitzen".		2. **crawl → gewesen → krabbeln**: The verb "crawl" is not translated at all in the candidate sentence, which should be addressed as "krabbeln".		3. **talk → redet → sprechen**: The word "redet" (talks) has a similar meaning to "sprechen" (speak), but within the context of more structured ability among the options, "sprechen" is more accurate.		Furthermore, the beginning portion of the sentence, "Edmund didn't sit up or crawl until he was three", is completely mistranslated to "Edmund ist erst drei gewesen, und er", which fails to convey the factual action aspect that was present in the source sentence translation.
meeting → erfüllt → macht		**Explanation:** "erfüllt" (fulfilling) is a mistranslation of "meeting" in this context. The intended meaning "meeting milestones" is better captured by "macht Fortschritte" (making progress), indicating achieving or reaching important goals. This error is significant as it alters the nuance of the achievement progress.
walking → geht → laufen  	riding → fährt → Fahrradfahren  		**Explanation:** "geht" (goes) is a mistranslation of "walking" and lacks the specific context of 'ambulation' with assistance. The reference term "laufen" more closely aligns with "walking," especially in the context of needing help. "fährt" refers to 'driving' or 'riding' more generally, but lacks the bike-specific activity conveyed as "Fahrradfahren" (bicycling). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the specific activity of bike riding is not clear in the candidate translation.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence. Even though "liebt" (loves) is absent, "spielt auch gerne" (also likes to play) sufficiently captures the same intent without altering the overall message significantly. Therefore, according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, no substantial mistranslation is detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation adequately conveys the original meaning. "Gebärdensprache" is an acceptable translation for "sign language," and while "zeigen" (to show) does not match "ausgedacht hat" (made up) verbatim, the context is preserved and valid. The structure is slightly altered but does not introduce any significant semantic discrepancies according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Picciuto → Picuto → Picciuto		**Explanation:** The name "Picciuto" is mistranslated as "Picuto" in the candidate translation, as evidenced by the source and reference translations. Names are significant and should be translated accurately to ensure proper identification, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and aligns well with the reference translation. Both translations acknowledge the uniqueness and creativity of the signs invented by Edmund, ensuring contextual accuracy and maintaining the original intent.
(Microcephaly → Mikrophale → Mikrozephalie)  	(measles → Masen → Masern)  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Mikrophale" is a mistranslation of "Microcephaly". The correct German translation is "Mikrozephalie". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "Mikrophale" does not relate to the medical condition described.	2. "Masen" is a misspelling of "measles". The accurate translation should be "Masern". The misspelling alters the intended meaning, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words "Symptome" (symptoms) and "Prognosen" (prognosis) in the candidate translation correctly reflect their counterparts in the source sentence. The phrase "können sehr unterschiedlich sein" (can be very different) accurately conveys the meaning of "can vary widely," making this an acceptable translation variation and complying with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "Es ist noch zu früh, um zu sagen" corresponds well with "It's too early to tell." Both "auf das Leben" and "das Leben". as well as "der mit Zika Infizierten" vs "der mit dem Zikavirus Infizierten" are acceptable variations. "auswirken wird" and "beeinflussen wird" are synonyms in this context, effectively conveying the same meaning. Therefore, no significant changes in meaning are present, complying with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
Picciuto → Picuto → Picciuto  	remembers → erinnert → erinnert sich  	toll → Bilanz → Preis  	uncertain → unsicheren → ungewissen  		**Explanation:**  	1. **Picciuto → Picuto**: "Picciuto" is a proper name that was misspelled as "Picuto". This is significant under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because correct names are crucial in translations.	2. **remembers → erinnert**: The correct phrase should be "erinnert sich," not just "erinnert." "sich" is essential in context to indicate the reflexive action, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	3. **toll → Bilanz**: "Bilanz" (balance/sheet) is a mistranslation of "toll," which refers to a cost or burden. "Preis" captures the intended meaning better, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	4. **uncertain → unsicheren**: "Unsicheren" has a subtle difference from "ungewissen," which better captures the intended nuance of not knowing/precariousness rather than a lack of safety.
saying → gesagt → fragte  		**Explanation:** "gesagt" (said) is a mistranslation of "saying" in this context, as the reference uses "fragte" (asked) to convey the continuous questioning implied by "kept saying". This follows the **Contextual Accuracy** rule and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as this change significantly alters the method of expression.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Was wird geschehen?" exactly matches the reference translation and conveys the same meaning as the source sentence, fulfilling the conditions of accurate translation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence "Und sie weiß es noch nicht richtig" is similar in meaning to the reference sentence "Und sie weiß es noch immer nicht wirklich." Both expressions convey uncertainty and a lack of full comprehension, and none of the words in the candidate sentence constitutes a significant mistranslation based on the guidelines provided.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence maintains the overall meaning of the source sentence and aligns closely with the reference translation. Differences in phrases such as "ewig" (forever) compared to "schon seit langer Zeit" (for a long time) and "um eine Prognose gebeten" (asked for a prognosis) compared to "nach der Prognose gefragt" (asked for the prognosis) are acceptable variations. These variations do not significantly change the intended meaning, thus adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
mothers → Säuglinge → Mütter  	birth defects → Geburtsmängeln → Geburtsschäden  
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Sie wissen, dass es für Sie besser wird." accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence "You know it will get better for you." The usage of "wird" instead of "werden wird" is an acceptable variation when translating future tense aspects into German, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, there are no significant mistranslations.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the source sentence. It captures the meaning and structure correctly when compared to the reference translation. There are no single-word translation errors affecting the meaning of the sentence, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Heavy → Starker → Heftige  	flooding → Hochwasser → Überschwemmung  	prompts → sorgt → gibt Anlass zu  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Starker" (strong) is a mistranslation of "Heavy," which is more accurately translated as "Heftige" in this context to convey the severity of the rain. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule since "heavy rain" implies intensity.		2. "Hochwasser" (high water) does not accurately convey "flooding," which is better translated as "Überschwemmung." This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the candidate word doesn't match the intended meaning.		3. "sorgt" (causes) doesn't capture "prompts" effectively, which is better expressed with "gibt Anlass zu" in the context of causing rescues. This alteration changes the underlying causality, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
rain → Regen → Regenfällen  	widespread → weitverbreitete → großflächige  	state of emergency → Ausnahmezustand → Notstand  		**Explanation:**  	- "rain" is translated as "Regen" in the candidate, but the reference uses "Regenfällen". While "Regen" is acceptable, in the context of heavy rain leading to emergencies, "Regenfällen" (rainfall) is preferable. This difference is subtle but meaningful here.	- "widespread" is translated as "weitverbreitete" in the candidate sentence, whereas the reference uses "großflächige". "großflächige" (large-scale) more accurately conveys the extent of flooding implied in "widespread".	- "state of emergency" is translated as "Ausnahmezustand" in the candidate, whereas the reference uses "Notstand". In this context, "Notstand" is the correct term commonly used for an emergency declaration.
Southeast → Südost → Südosten  	southern → Süd → Süden  	overflowing → überfüllten → überfluteten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Südost" (South-East) is not an accurate translation for "southeast" in the given context. "Südosten" conveys the appropriate regional reference.  	2. "Süd" (south) does not capture the meaning of "southern" in this context, where "Süden" (southerly regions) would be consistent with the source sentence.	3. "Überfüllten" (overfilled) incorrectly portrays "overflowing". The term "überfluteten" (flooded/overflowed) more accurately conveys the condition of rivers overflowing their banks.
state → staatliche → Staats  	parishes → Parisaparitäten → Gemeinden  		**Explanation:** "staatliche" (state-related) is a mistranslation of "state" as intended as part of the title "Louisiana Gov." or "Gouverneur von Louisiana", which should be rendered in context as "Staats". This is a violation of the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Parisaparitäten" is nonsensical in this context as the translation for "parishes", altering the meaning significantly and violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule to provide "Gemeinden" (communities) as the correct term.
spokesman → Sprecherin → Sprecher	requests → Forderungen → Anfragen	boats → Schiffen → Boote	sandbags → Sandbags → Sandsäcke		**Explanation:** 	- "Sprecherin" (female speaker) is a gender mismatch for "spokesman", which should be "Sprecher" (male speaker or gender-neutral).	- "Forderungen" (demands) alters the meaning of "requests," which should be "Anfragen" (requests).	- "Schiffen" (ships) does not convey the same sense as "Boote" (boats); "boats" is more accurate in this context.	- "Sandbags" was left untranslated, the correct term should be "Sandsäcke".
sandbags → Sandbags → Sandsäcke  		**Explanation:** "Sandbags" is the English word used directly in the translation, whereas the correct German term should be "Sandsäcke". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the term should be properly translated.
flood → Hochwasserschau → Überschwemmungswarnsystem  		**Explanation:** "Hochwasserschau" (flood show) is a mistranslation of "flood watch", which should be translated as "Überschwemmungswarnsystem" (flood warning system or flood watch). The term "Hochwasserschau" does not convey the intended warning or alert message found in "Überschwemmungswarnsystem".
inches → Zentimeter → Zoll  		**Explanation:** "Zentimeter" (centimeters) is a mistranslation of "inches". This changes the measurement scale and significantly affects the meaning of the amount of rainfall expected. According to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, this alteration of measurement requires reporting.
flood → Flutwelle → Flutfrühwarnsystem  	Mobile → mobilen → Mobile  		**Explanation:** "Flutwelle" (flood wave) is a mistranslation of "flood watch". The correct term should relate to a warning system rather than a wave itself. "mobilen" (mobile) is incorrectly translated for the geographic location "Mobile," which refers to a specific area and should remain unchanged in translation.
Baton Rouge → Baton Roge → Baton Rouges  	crests → Cremes → Pegel  		**Explanation:** "Baton Roge" is a misspelling and mistranslation of "Baton Rouge," which alters the intended location name, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Cremes" is a mistranslation of "crests," creating a significant meaning error when describing river levels, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Forecaster → Herr → Metereologe  	Rouge → Rote → Rouge  		**Explanation:** "Herr" (Mr.) is a mistranslation of "Forecaster", as it does not convey the professional context intended by "Metereologe" (meteorologist), violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Rote" is a mistranslation of "Rouge", significantly altering the meaning since it changes the name of the location, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
1. flooding → Hochwasser → Überschwemmung  	2. downstream → nachgelagerten → stromabwärts  	3. Ascension → Fall → Ascension  	4. threat → Bedrohung → Gefahr  	5. swollen → Schwestflüsse → über die getretenen Flüsse  		**Explanation:**  	- "Hochwasser" does not fully capture the scope of "Überschwemmung," which has a more comprehensive and threatening connotation.	- "nachgelagerten" inaccurately conveys "stromabwärts," which specifically indicates the downstream direction.	- "Fall" is incorrect for "Ascension" as it translates to a completely different place name.	- "Bedrohung" implies a more imminent danger than "Gefahr," which fits better with the context.	- "Schwestflüsse" is a mistranslation of "swollen," which should relate to rivers being overflown or overflowing due to excess water.
Tickfaw → Tickfahre → Tickfaw  	state → Staatsstrecke → Staatsgrenze  	Friday → [missing] → Freitag  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Tickfahre" is a mistranslation of "Tickfaw." The name of the river should remain unchanged as it is a proper noun, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	   	2. "Staatsstrecke" (state route) is a mistranslation of "state line." The term should be "Staatsgrenze" (state border), following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the geographical reference.	   	3. The word "Friday" is missing in the candidate translation, which is a critical time reference and affects the sentence's accuracy. Removing this violates both the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
plucking → geplündert → zupften  		**Explanation:** "geplündert" (plundered) is a mistranslation of "plucking". It significantly alters the meaning from rescuing to stealing, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the intent is to save, not plunder.
stepson → Student → Stiefsohn  		**Explanation:** "Student" is a mistranslation of "stepson". This error significantly changes the meaning as "Student" refers to a student or pupil instead of a stepson, which is crucial for identifying the relationship described in the sentence.
waters → Gewässer → Wasser  	overnight → von heute auf morgen → über Nacht  		**Explanation:** "Gewässer" (bodies of water) is a mistranslation of "waters", which in this context refers to a single body of water, necessitating "Wasser". This follows the **Identify Mistranslations** rule, as "Gewässer" suggests multiple bodies of water, changing the intended meaning. "von heute auf morgen" translates to "from today to tomorrow", whereas the correct expression "über Nacht" is needed to convey the immediate time frame, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
**(stepson → Mann → Stiefsohn)**		**Explanation:** "Mann" (man) is a mistranslation of "stepson", which changes the familial relationship described in the sentence. The source clearly indicates a stepson, making "Mann" contextually inaccurate.
water → kommt → strömte  	kept → kommt → strömte und strömte herein  		**Explanation:** "kommt" (comes) is a mistranslation of both "water kept on coming" and the continuous action of water. This significantly alters the intended continuous flow described in the source. Hence, "kommt" is flagged as incorrect compared to "strömte und strömte herein" (flowed and flowed in) in the reference translation.
came → kam → erreichte  	waist → mir → Taille  		**Explanation:** "kam" (came) is an incorrect translation of "reached", which changes the meaning of the sentence from indicating a level or height to simply indicating an arrival. "mir" (me) is a translation error for "waist"; "Taille" (waist) is necessary to indicate the part of the body being referenced, fulfilling the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
creek → Reke → Flusses  		**Explanation:** "Reke" is a mistranslation of "creek". The German word for "creek" or "small river" in this context is "Fluss". This error violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Reke" is incorrect and not a recognized term in German for "creek".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In the candidate sentence, the translation conveys the same meaning as the reference, utilizing variations that are acceptable within context. The words like "Familienangehörigen" for "family members" are appropriate synonyms and do not significantly change the sentence's meaning. "hätte" as "hätten" and "ist" as "wäre" are stylistic differences preserving the meaning effectively. There are no single-word errors that violate the instructions' guidelines.
emergency → Rettungskräfte → Nothelfer  	fire station → Feuerwerk → Feuerwache  		**Explanation:** "Rettungskräfte" (rescue forces) is a mistranslation of "emergency workers", as "Nothelfer" (emergency helpers) is more precise given the context. "Feuerwerk" (fireworks) is a mistranslation of "fire station," which significantly changes the meaning since a fire station is a location where they were taken, not related to fireworks.
says → sagt → sagte  	flooding → Hochwasser → Überschwemmung  	is → wird → hatte  	officials → Beamte → Behörden  		**Explanation:** 		- "says" was translated as "sagt", but the reference used "sagte", indicating past tense to match the rest of the sentence.	- "flooding" was translated as "Hochwasser", however, "Überschwemmung" is more contextually accurate for the situation of widespread flooding.	- "is" was translated as "wird", which implies future tense; the reference used "hatte", indicating an action that has already occurred.	- "officials" was translated as "Beamte", which usually means "officers" or "clerks"; "Behörden" (authorities) better matches the intended meaning of officials responsible for public safety measures.
Krautmann → Ein → Laut  	inches → Zinken → Zoll  		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence has two errors. First, the translation omitted "Krautmann" from the beginning, changing the subject of the sentence. Second, "Zinken" is a mistranslation of "inches" and should have been translated as "Zoll" to accurately convey the measurement unit.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essential meaning of the source sentence well. "Stark" (heavily), "durch Regenfälle" (by rainfall), and "seit Mittwoch" (since Wednesday) effectively convey the original message. While there are some differences in word choice and structure, such as "vollgesogen" versus "gesättigt", these do not constitute significant errors according to the instructions, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Heavy → Starke → schwere  	cancellation → Annullierung → Unterrichtsausfall  		**Explanation:** "Starke" (strong) is used in place of "schwere" (heavy), which, while often interchangeably used, reflects a slightly different intensity aspect here, and "schwere" better matches the source "heavy" when context is considered. "Annullierung" (annulment) is not an appropriate translation of "cancellation" in the context of schools, as "Unterrichtsausfall" (class cancellation) correctly conveys classes being canceled.
affiliate → Assistente → Tochtersender  	alderwoman → Älterin → Beigeordnete  	flooded → überflutet → überschwemmte  		**Explanation:**  	- "Assistente" (assistant) is a mistranslation of "affiliate". The correct translation should be "Tochtersender" (subsidiary/broadcast partner), which keeps the intended meaning.  	- "Älterin" (elder) is a mistranslation of "alderwoman". The correct word, "Beigeordnete", accurately reflects a member of a municipal council, which changes the intended meaning.  	- "überflutet" (flooded/overwhelmed) is a mistranslation of "flooded" in the context of the sentence. The reference "überschwemmte" more accurately reflects that the homes were affected by flooding, which aligns with the context of homes being in a flooded state versus an action performed by the alderwoman.
had been → waren → wurden  	flooding → überschwemmen → überschwemmt  		**Explanation:** "waren" translates to "were" or "had been" but in the past simple tense, "wurden" correctly conveys the passive construction used in the context. "überschwemmen" (to flood) is a present tense form implying the churches are currently causing flooding, whereas "überschwemmt" (flooded) is needed as a past participle to indicate the state of being flooded. This aligns with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
people → Menschen → Leute   	stranded → mit → angespült  		**Explanation:** The word "Menschen" (people) is a potential translation of "people," but "Leute" is a closer match since it fits better with the context provided by the reference. The phrase "mit hohem Wasser" does not accurately translate "stranded by high water." The candidate's "mit" (with) changes the meaning. The error is significant, as "stranded" indicates a state of being trapped, which is captured by "vom Hochwasser angespült" (washed up by high water) in the reference, thus "mit" is listed as the key error here.
evacuated → evakuierte → Evakuierten		**Explanation:** "evakuierte" is a direct translation of "evacuated", but it refers to those who are evacuated in a more general context rather than as a noun referring to "Evakuierten" (the evacuees) in this specific context. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the candidate translation incorrectly uses a past participle adjective form instead of the noun for individuals, which changes the grammatical correctness and specific reference of the sentence.
allowed → dürfen → können	starts → Anfängen → anfängt	once → nach → Sobald	recede → des Wassers → zurückgehen  		**Explanation:** 	1. "dürfen" (allowed) is used instead of "können" (able to/can). The translation changes the meaning slightly since "dürfen" implies permission rather than ability.	2. "Anfängen" (beginnings) inaccurately translates "starts". The source sentence conveys "starting to recede," needing the use of "anfängt".	3. "nach" (after) instead of "Sobald" (once) alters timing precision, as "once" suggests immediacy.	4. "des Wassers" (of the water) stands in for "recede" (zurückgehen), misrepresenting the action of the water and altering the sentence's intended meaning dynamically.
high water → hohen Wassers → Hochwassers  	sandbags → Sandtaschen → Sandsäcke  		**Explanation:**  	1. "hohen Wassers" (high water) is a mistranslation of "Hochwassers" (flooding), which is a more precise term in this context and better conveys the severity of the situation.	2. "Sandtaschen" (sandbags) is translated directly but the word "Sandtaschen" is not commonly used in German for this context. The term "Sandsäcke" is the standard term for this purpose.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation, the word "Flut" for "flood" aligns correctly in this context with "Überschwemmung", specifically for a "major flood". The term "Stadtverwalter" for "city administrator" and the overall sentence structure accurately convey the intended message from the source. The differences in the reference are minor and do not significantly alter the meaning or correctness, complying with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The translation "Dieses Ereignis ist auf dem richtigen Weg, um ein ähnliches Ereignis zu werden" captures the essence of the source sentence. The phrases "on track" and "auf dem richtigen Weg" convey similar meanings, and no individual words are mistranslated in a way that significantly alters the meaning. This adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
steady → stabile → weiterhin  		**Explanation:** "stabile" (stable) is a mistranslation of "steady". The context suggests ongoing, continuous rainfall, which would be more accurately captured with "weiterhin" (continued) as used in the reference translation. This significantly changes the type of rain being described, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
None → nichts → keine		**Explanation:** "nichts" (nothing) is a mistranslation of "none" (keine). This changes the meaning of the sentence by incorrectly suggesting that nothing at all has been reported, rather than specifically that no houses have been reported as flooded. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with the reference translation, maintaining the meaning of the source sentence. While there is a stylistic difference with "von" and "bei" (of vs. at) for "manager of", both are acceptable and do not change the meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. The term "Gegend" (area) vs. "Gebiet" (area) shows no significant change in meaning, making it contextually accurate. Thus, no single-word errors significantly impacting meaning were detected.
seen → gesehen → gesehen  	down → zurück → noch immer  		**Explanation:** "zurück" (back) is a mistranslation of "down" in the context of water continuing to flow or descend. Instead of suggesting continuation, "zurück" implies returning, which alters the intended meaning of ongoing rainfall or flooding. The rest of the sentence, including word order, does not necessitate reporting additional single-word errors beyond this significant meaning change.
(Philadelphia shooting → Philadelphia-Schüsse → Schießerei in Philadelphia)		**Explanation:** "Schüsse" (shots) is a mistranslation of "shooting" in this context. The intended meaning refers to a shooting incident, which "Schießerei" accurately captures. "Philadelphia-Schüsse" suggests individual gunshots rather than a shooting event, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
shot → erschossen → angeschossen		**Explanation:** "erschossen" (shot dead) is a mistranslation of "shot" in this context, as the reference indicates "angeschossen" (shot but not necessarily fatally). This significantly changes the perceived outcome for the 6-year-old boy, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The translations of "child's" to "Kindes", "identified" to "identifiziert", and the other key elements maintain the intended meanings. Both "in" and "für" can be contextually adapted to convey the location of identification to the broadcaster. Therefore, no significant errors in meaning are found when comparing the candidate's translation to the source and reference following the task's guidelines.
groin → Getreide → Lende	abdomen → Abdrücke → Bauch		**Explanation:** "Getreide" (grain) is a mistranslation of "groin," which is contextually incorrect. "Abdrücke" (impressions/prints) is a mistranslation of "abdomen," which changes the intended meaning significantly. These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
just → nur → viel  	took → nahm → hat durchgemacht  	station → Bahnhof → Sender  		**Explanation:** 	1. "nur" (only) is a mistranslation of "just" in this context, where "viel durchgemacht" (went through a lot) is a more appropriate rendering.	2. "nahm" (took) misrepresents the meaning intended by "went through" or "suffered".	3. "Bahnhof" (train station) is incorrect for the context of a broadcasting station; "Sender" (station) is the right term here.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "es" and "das" can validly translate to "it" in this context of disbelief. The candidate sentence conveys the same meaning as the source, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
listed → aufgeführt → eingestuft  	condition → Verhältnissen → Zustand  	surgeries → Chirurgen → Operationen  		**Explanation:**  	1. **"aufgeführt"** (listed) is a mistranslation of "listed" in this context. The correct word should align with the medical context, which is better represented by "eingestuft" (classified/assessed).	2. **"Verhältnissen"** (conditions) is a mistranslation of "condition." The suitable word in medical terminology would be "Zustand" (condition/state).	3. **"Chirurgen"** (surgeons) is a mistranslation of "surgeries." The appropriate term for surgical procedures is "Operationen" (operations/surgeries), notably altering the sentence's meaning. These errors significantly change the sentence's medical context, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essence of the source sentence adequately. "Familie" (Family), "sagt" (tells), and "erholen" (to recover) are consistent with the source and reference sentences. While there are differences in structure and some words are omitted (such as "des Jungen" and "voraussichtlich"), these do not constitute significant single-word mistranslations as per the task's instructions.
first grade → erste Stufe → erste Klasse		**Explanation:** "erste Stufe" (first stage/level) is a mistranslation of "first grade" which refers to a specific year in elementary education. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it does not correspond to the schooling term intended in the context, whereas "erste Klasse" correctly represents the meaning as understood in the educational context.
among → unter → einer von  	people → Menschen → Personen  	shot → erschossen → angeschossen  	Germantown → deutschen Teil → Germantown  		**Explanation:**  	- "unter" (under) is used in the candidate translation but does not fully capture "among" in this context, where "einer von" (one of) is more precise.	- "Menschen" (humans) is a less accurate translation for "people" which is better captured by "Personen" (persons) in this specific context.	- "erschossen" (shot dead) changes the meaning from "angeschossen" (shot, but not necessarily dead). This is a significant meaning difference.	- "deutschen Teil" (German part) is incorrect for "Germantown," as this is a proper noun and should not be translated.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Although there are minor differences in wording between the candidate and reference translations, such as "erschossen" vs. "angeschossen" and the rendering of ages, both translations convey the intended meaning of men being shot and their ages. The critical elements of the sentence are intact, so this follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both the candidate translation and the reference translation effectively convey the same meaning as the source sentence. There are no single-word errors that significantly change the meaning. "wurde gemeldet" is a suitable equivalent of "was reported," and "in einem stabilen Zustand aufgeführt" aligns with "were listed in stable condition."
found → erschossen → aufgefunden  	shot → erschossen → angeschossen  	seat → Vorsitz → Vordersitz  	condition → Verhältnissen → Zustand  		**Explanation:** 	1. "erschossen" (shot dead) is a mistranslation of "found" which significantly alters the meaning of the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. The correct translation, "aufgefunden," means "found."	2. "erschossen" (shot dead) is also incorrectly used for "shot," which should be translated as "angeschossen" (shot but not dead), following the same **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule regarding severity.	3. "Vorsitz" (presidency/chairmanship) is a mistranslation of "seat," which in the context of a car should be "Vordersitz" (front seat), violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as a chairmanship does not fit the context of a car.	4. "Verhältnissen" (circumstances) is a mistranslation of "condition," which should be "Zustand," referring to a physical state or condition, as per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
victims → Opfer → Opfer  	wounded → Verwundeten → verletzten  	shooter → Schuss → Täter  		**Explanation:** "Opfer" is correct in both the candidate and reference, and thus no error is reported for "victims". The significant error of focus is "Verwundeten" (wounded) misconveying "verletzten" (injured) as the meaning remains clear. Lastly, "Schuss" (shot) is a mistranslation of "shooter" ("Täter"), which significantly changes the meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
tells → berichten → mit  	gunmen → Gunnen → Schützen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "tells" is mistranslated as "berichten" (report) instead of the more accurate "mit" (tells), which matches the context and construction of the reference sentence. This affects the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	2. "gunmen" is mistranslated as "Gunnen," which is not a correct German word. The correct translation is "Schützen," affecting the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it denotes responsible shooters.
weapon-style → Waffenstil → Sturmgewehre  	littered → erstickt → übersähten  	scene → Szenarium → Tatort  		**Explanation:**  	- "Waffenstil" (weapon style) is a mistranslation of "weapon-style," which should be "Sturmgewehre" (assault rifles), as it refers to the type of weapons.	- "erstickt" (choked) is a mistranslation of "littered," which should be "übersähten" (littered), maintaining the context that the scene was covered.	- "Szenarium" (scenario) is a mistranslation of "scene," which should be "Tatort" (crime scene), as it refers to the specific location of the event.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the reference translation. The words "definitely" and "eindeutig," as well as "ongoing" and "andauernd," are acceptable translations in this context, and the structure conveys the overall meaning accurately. Hence, no significant single-word translation errors are present.
casings → Fälle → Hülsen  	sidewalk → Sidalwalks → Gehwegs  		**Explanation:** "Fälle" (cases) is an incorrect translation of "casings" in this context as it significantly changes the meaning. "Sidalwalks" appears to be a mistranslation of "sidewalk", likely due to a typo or translation error, and significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, so it is marked as an error.
police → Polizei → Polizei	station → Bahnhof → Sender		**Explanation:** "Bahnhof" (train station) is a mistranslation of "station," which refers to a broadcasting station in this context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, where "Sender" (broadcaster) is more appropriate. Further, "Philadelphia police" is translated as "Philadelphia police" in the candidate rather than "Polizei in Philadelphia," which appears to be an unexpected language switch but still within context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence "Mehrere Häuser und Fahrzeuge in der Region wurden ebenfalls getroffen." accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence "Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck." All key elements, such as "houses" to "Häuser", "vehicles" to "Fahrzeuge", and "area" to "der Region" match the reference sentence appropriately. Additionally, the structure and meaning of the candidate translation align with both the source and reference sentences, as per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both the candidate sentence and the reference translation correctly convey the main ideas of the source sentence. Although there are differences in structure and word choice, none of these differences represent significant mistranslations at the word level. For example, "Verhaftungen" and "Festnahmen" both translate to "arrests", and "prüft" and "überprüft" both mean "reviews/checks" in this context. The use of "angeblich" (allegedly) and "Berichten zufolge" (reportedly) are equivalent expressions here. This satisfies the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, leading to the conclusion that there are no meaningful single-word translation errors.
Tuesday → Dienstag → durch einen Querschläger  	bullet → Dienstag → Querschläger  		**Explanation:** The word "Dienstag" (Tuesday) is incorrect in the candidate translation when referring to what hit the girl in the arm, as the source sentence refers to a "stray bullet." The proper translation for "stray bullet" is "Querschläger," indicating that the girl was hit by a bullet, not the day of the week. This significantly alters the meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation adequately captures the meaning of the source sentence. The words "searching" (sucht), "recovering" (erholt sich), "suspect" (Verdächtigen), "still" (noch), and other elements are correctly translated and do not significantly change the meaning, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Minor differences, such as the placement of "still" (noch), do not result in a loss of meaning in this context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Warum brauchen wir Simone, Gabby und Laurie" closely matches the reference translation "Weshalb wir Simone, Gabby und Laurie brauchen." Here, "Warum" and "Weshalb" are synonymous in this context, both meaning "why." The rest of the sentence is identical in both translations. Therefore, there are no meaningful differences or mistranslations to report, adhering to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule and correctly **Handling Ambiguity Carefully**.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence and the reference translation convey the same overall meaning despite differences in phrasing. The candidate translation is a valid and acceptable rendering of the source sentence into German with no single-word errors significantly altering the meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The sentence largely retains the intended meaning in the candidate translation. Any slight variations, such as "in allen Olympischen Sommerspielen" compared to "bei jeder Sommerolympiade", convey the same meaning in this context, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, no significant errors that alter the context or intended meaning have been found.
(Gymnasts → Simone Biles → Turnerinnen)  	(Features → Umfasst → Hat)  	(Color → Farbe → Hautfarbe)  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Simone Biles" is incorrectly placed where "gymnasts" should be, significantly altering the sentence structure. In this context, "Turnerinnen" is the correct translation. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.		2. "Umfasst" (encompasses) is a mistranslation of "features," which should be closer to "hat" (has) in this context. This adheres to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Identify Mistranslations** rules.		3. "Farbe" (color) should specifically refer to "Hautfarbe" (skin color), as the context involves "young girls of color." This change is important to convey the intended meaning related to diversity, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Jews → Juden → Jüdin  	Catholic → Katholik → Katholikin  	make-up → erfundene → Struktur  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Juden" (Jews) is a mistranslation of "Jewish", which in this context should refer to the singular "Jüdin" for Aly Raisman, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Katholik" (Catholic) is a mistranslation of "Catholic", which in this context should refer to the feminine "Katholikin" for Madison Kocian, adhering to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	3. "erfundene" (invented) is used in the candidate, significantly altering the meaning of "make-up," which should be "Struktur" here, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it changes the context of how the team is defined.
team → Team → Mannschaft  	America → Amerika → USA  		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation, "Team" is used, which is less precise than "Mannschaft" in this context. The source sentence implies representation, which "Mannschaft" conveys more accurately than "Team". The use of "America" as "Amerika" does not capture the intended nuance as "USA" does; "USA" directly references the country rather than the continent. These differences change the nuanced meaning significantly, thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
black → Schwarzen → schwarze	Latina → Frauen → hispanische		**Explanation:**	- "Schwarzen" (blacks) is a mistranslation of "black" when referring to a female presence — it should be "schwarze" (female version of black).	- "Frauen" (women) is a mistranslation of "Latina" as it loses the specific emphasis on the Hispanic female presence in the source sentence.
number → Zahl → Nummer  	female → Zigeunerinnen → Turnerinnen  	gymnast → Zigeunerinnen → Turnerinnen  	African-American → Afrika-Amerikaner → Afro-Amerikanerin  		**Explanation:**		1. **Number**: "Zahl" (number as in quantity) does not fit this context, where "Nummer" refers to a ranking. It changes the meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	   	2. **Female**: "Zigeunerinnen" (gypsy women) is an incorrect and culturally insensitive term in this context. "Turnerinnen" (gymnasts) is the correct term here, according to the **Identify Mistranslations** rule.		3. **Gymnast**: Similarly, "Zigeunerinnen" is incorrectly used for "gymnast". This double error drastically changes the meaning, and is addressed under **Focus on Single-Word Errors**.		4. **African-American**: "Afrika-Amerikaner" lacks the gender-specific term "Amerikanerin" which is necessary since "Afro-Amerikanerin" indicates a female African-American, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Im vergangenen Jahr" and "Letztes Jahr" are valid translations for "Last year". The use of "die 1 und 2" instead of "#1 und #2" maintains the intended ranking meaning. Hence, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, there are no significant changes in meaning, and no errors are reported.
powerful → mächtig → Stärke		**Explanation:** The word "mächtig" (mighty) is a mistranslation of "powerful". While "mächtig" can refer to strength, in this context, the correct reference word "Stärke" (strength) better captures the intended meaning, meeting the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
Olympic → olympischer → Olympiagewinnerin  		**Explanation:** "olympischer Verfechter" (Olympic advocate) is incorrect in this context where "Olympic champion" refers to a winner, not an advocate. The word "Olympiagewinnerin" (Olympic winner) is more accurate for the intended meaning of "Olympic champion." The focus is on the word "olympischer," which differs from the reference translation's emphasis on the concept of winning. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules to highlight the most significant change in meaning.
dreimaligen → dreifachen → dreimaligen  		**Explanation:** "dreimaligen" (three-time) is a mistranslation of "dreifachen" (triple) as it refers to Simone Biles being a "three-time World Champion," not "three-time World Championship." The error significantly changes the attribution to Simone Biles, necessitating this correction for contextual accuracy.
fourth → vierte → vierte  	straight → klare → heterosexuelle  	around → Umkreis → Mehrkampfveranstaltung  		**Explanation:**  	1. "vierte" (fourth) is translated correctly; however, it must be emphasized that "klare" (clear) is a mistranslation of "straight." The word "straight" refers here to "heterosexual," which is not the intended translation meaning in the reference but to an unbroken streak or sequence.	2. "Umkreis" (perimeter) is a mistranslation of "all-around" as it refers to a complete area rather than a context of an all-around event or competition discussed in the reference as "Mehrkampfveranstaltung."
teammate → Teamat → Mannschaftmitglied  	earned → verdient → gewann  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Teamat" is a mistranslation of "teammate." The correct word is "Mannschaftmitglied," which follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "Teamat" is not a proper German word in this context.	2. "verdient" (earned) in this context conveys the connotation of deserving rather than winning, which alters the intended meaning. The reference word "gewann" (won) better aligns with the athletic context, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
top → Spitzenspitze → Spitze  	gymnastics → Sport → Turn  		**Explanation:** "Spitzenspitze" (pinnacle pinnacle) is a mistranslation of "top" in this context, where "Spitze" (top) would be more appropriate, satisfying the **Identify Mistranslations** guideline. "Sport" (sport) should be "Turn" (gymnastics) to convey the correct type of class, complying with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Aly → Madrid → Aly  	Madison → Madrid → Madison  	make → machen → schaffen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Madrid" (Madrid) is used in place of both "Aly" and "Madison", which are names, translating people's names is incorrect here. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it changes the identities involved.	- "machen" (make) is a literal translation of "make" in the context of forming or constructing something and does not fit "schaffen" (achieve), which is more appropriate for achieving a goal, like making a team, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
```	Five → 5 → Fünf	gymnasts → Spornalisten → Turnerinnen	coaching → Coaching → Jahr	```		**Explanation:** 	1. **Five → 5 → Fünf:** The candidate uses the numeral "5", while the source and reference use "Five" and "Fünf", respectively. Numerals are typically an acceptable substitute for words, but since the context specifically uses "Five" as a significant label (the "Final Five"), this can be considered an error of not adhering to the source's explicit textual representation.	   	2. **gymnasts → Spornalisten → Turnerinnen:** "Spornalisten" (a non-standard or incorrect term), does not accurately translate "gymnasts". The correct translation, "Turnerinnen", is much more contextually appropriate.	   	3. **coaching → Coaching → Jahr:** Although "Coaching" could be valid depending on context, given that the reference uses "Jahr" to denote the finality of the time span, "Jahr" reflects the meaning of the source, "year," in the context of a concluding year of coaching (rather than the act of coaching itself).
reality → Realität → Realität  	gymnastics → Gymnastik → Turnen  	gymnasts → Sportler → Turner  	train → fahren → trainieren  	maintained → gehalten → aufrechterhalten  	facility → Fazilität → Einrichtung  	travel → Reisen → Reisekosten  	uniform → Uniform → Bekleidung  	competition fees → Wettbewerbsgebühren → Wettkampfgebühren  	hotel fees → Hotelgebühren → Hotelkosten  	coaches → Reisebusse → Trainer  	gymnasts → Pornographie → Turner  		**Explanation:** 		1. **gymnastics → Gymnastik → Turnen**: "Gymnastik" usually refers to general exercises, while "Turnen" is more specifically athletic gymnastics, fitting the context better.	   	2. **gymnasts → Sportler → Turner**: "Sportler" is a general term for "athletes", whereas "Turner" specifically means "gymnasts".	   	3. **train → fahren → trainieren**: "fahren" means "to travel" or "drive", whereas "trainieren" means "to train".	   	4. **maintained → gehalten → aufrechterhalten**: "gehalten" means "held" or "kept", while "aufrechterhalten" means "maintained".	   	5. **facility → Fazilität → Einrichtung**: "Fazilität" is a direct loanword not commonly used in German; "Einrichtung" is the more appropriate translation.	   	6. **travel → Reisen → Reisekosten**: "Reisen" means "journeys" or "travels", while "Reisekosten" refers to "travel costs", which fits contextually.	   	7. **uniform → Uniform → Bekleidung**: While "Uniform" is technically correct, in the context of gymnastics where it refers to outfits, "Bekleidung" or "Kleidung" would be more suited.	   	8. **competition fees → Wettbewerbsgebühren → Wettkampfgebühren**: "Wettbewerbsgebühren" is technically correct but "Wettkampfgebühren" (competition fees specific to sports) fits contextually.	   	9. **hotel fees → Hotelgebühren → Hotelkosten**: "Hotelgebühren" suggests a charge for services, while "Hotelkosten" implies overall expenses, fitting the context better.	   	10. **coaches → Reisebusse → Trainer**: "Reisebusse" means "buses", which is incorrect for "coaches". "Trainer" is the suitable translation.		11. **gymnasts → Pornographie → Turner**: "Pornographie" is likely an incorrect translation error for what should be "Turner", referring to "gymnasts".
gymnastics → Spornastikvereine → Turnvereine  	clubs → Spornastikvereine → Turnvereine  	business → Unternehmen → Geschäft  		**Explanation:** "Spornastikvereine" is not a standard German translation for "gymnastics clubs," which should be "Turnvereine." Thus, both "gymnastics" and "clubs" are mistranslated. Additionally, "Unternehmen" (company) does not fit the context of "business," which should be "Geschäft," in this sentence.
gymnasts → Zigeunerinnen → Turner		**Explanation:** The word "Zigeunerinnen" (gypsy women) is a mistranslation of "gymnasts". The candidate translation incorrectly changes the group participating in the training, which significantly alters the sentence's meaning. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Aimee → Aime → Aimee  	coach → Bus → Trainerin  	Hernandez → Hernández → Hernandez  	coached → besucht → trainiert  	gymnastics → Spitzfindigkeiten → Turnen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Aime" is a misspelled version of "Aimee," the name should remain consistent.  	2. "Bus" is a mistranslation of "coach," which in this context refers to a sports instructor.  	3. "Hernández" introduces an incorrect accent to "Hernandez," deviating from the reference.  	4. "besucht" (visited) is a mistranslation of "coached," as the correct action is training.  	5. "Spitzfindigkeiten" (sophistries) is a mistranslation of "gymnastics," leading to significant change in meaning.
affordable → erschwinglichere → leistbareres  	gymnastics training → Gymnastikausbildung → Turntraining  		**Explanation:** "erschwinglichere" refers to "affordable" but the word "leistbareres" better captures the nuance of affordability in the context of services provided. "Gymnastikausbildung" translates directly from "gymnastics training," but "Turntraining" is the term that better fits the context and meaning as it is more commonly used in German for "gymnastics training," making it a more accurate choice in this particular setting.
gymnastics → Gymnasik → Turnstiftung  		**Explanation:** "Gymnasik" is a mistranslation of "gymnastics foundation". The correct translation in context is "Turnstiftung". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "Gymnasik" does not convey the institutional or organizational aspect as "foundation" does.
urban → städtische → urbane  	Hispanic → spanische → hispanische  	gymnastics → Gymnastiker → Turnen  		**Explanation:**  	- "städtische" is a mistranslation of "urban", as "urbane" would be a more precise match in this context, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "spanische" is incorrect for "Hispanic," as it specifically refers to Spanish (from Spain), while "hispanische" reflects the intended demographic context, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** guideline.	- "Gymnastiker" (gymnasts) is a mistranslation of "gymnastics," which should be "Turnen" to correctly convey the activity rather than the individuals, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
expand → ausdehnen → expandieren  	gymnastics → Gymnastiker → Turnen  	opportunity → Chance → Möglichkeit  		**Explanation:**  	- "expand" is mistranslated as "ausdehnen", whereas the correct term in this context is "expandieren", meaning to grow or expand a business or presence, as indicated by the reference.	- "gymnastics" is mistranslated as "Gymnastiker", which means "gymnasts" (people), instead of "Turnen" (the sport), which is the intended meaning in this context.	- "opportunity" is mistranslated as "Chance", while "Möglichkeit" would be more contextually appropriate as it refers to the opportunity for the youth to learn from the sport.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Gymnastics" and "Turnen" are acceptable ways to refer to gymnastics in German, depending on the context. "Entschlossenheit" (determination) and "Bestimmtheit" (resolve) are closely related in meaning, and "harte Arbeit" (hard work) was translated as "harte Arbeit," retaining the meaning. Hence, according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, no single-word translation errors are present.
benefits → Vorteile → Vorteile  	good → gute → die  	success → Erfolg → schulischen und beruflichen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "good" in the source sentence refers to "die Gesundheit" (the health) in the reference, rather than directly modifying "health". This suggests a structure difference rather than a mistranslation, so not listed.  	2. "success" is translated to "Erfolg," which is correct, but the reference expands it to specify "schulischen und beruflichen" (school and work-related), highlighting a context-specific nuance. However, this doesn't single out a specific mistranslated word as required by **Focus on Single-Word Errors**.  	3. Initial interpretation saw "benefits" correctly translated to "Vorteile" and good health context maintained.  	  	Ultimately, no single-word translation errors significantly altering meaning were found. Thus:  	**No translation errors detected.**
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the intended meaning of the source sentence adequately. Though there are some differences with the reference translation, such as "Teams" instead of "Mannschaft" and "Gymnastik" instead of "Turnen", these do not significantly alter the meaning in a way that warrants reporting as per the provided guidelines. Both "Team" and "Mannschaft", as well as "Gymnastik" and "Turnen", are contextually appropriate variations. Therefore, there are no translation errors to report.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Sportliche Betätigung ist so wichtig, insbesondere für Mädchen" conveys the essential meaning of the source sentence "To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls." Although the structure differs from the reference, the emphasis on the importance of sports for girls is maintained. The candidate's phrase "Sportliche Betätigung" (sporting activity) appropriately relates to participation in sport, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where both candidate and reference reflect the same intent.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Dies ist eine so spannende Zeit." accurately reflects the meaning of the source sentence "This is such an exciting time." The difference between "Dies" and "Das" does not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence and both can be used interchangeably in this context to convey the intended meaning. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as no significant translation error is present.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. Although there are differences in structure and word choice, such as "ernste Demonstration" instead of "echte Darstellung," and "Gewinnung des Golds" instead of "Holen des Mannschaftsgolds," these do not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence in context. Hence, according to the guidelines, no translation errors are reported.
junior doctors → jungen Ärzten → Assistenzärzte  	set to mount → weitere → möchten organisieren  		**Explanation:**  	1. "jungen Ärzten" (young doctors) is a mistranslation of "junior doctors". The term "Assistenzärzte" (assistant doctors) is a more accurate and specific translation of "junior doctors" in the given context, fulfilling the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "weitere" (further) alone does not capture "set to mount" (intend to organize/conduct). The reference uses "möchten organisieren" (want to organize), which better conveys the intent expressed in the source sentence. Hence, "weitere" fails to capture the full meaning, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
junior doctors → jungen Ärzte → Assistenzärzte  		**Explanation:** "jungen Ärzte" (young doctors) is a mistranslation of "junior doctors." The specific term for "junior doctors" in this context is "Assistenzärzte," as used in the medical field for those in training positions, which is contextually and professionally more accurate.
revealed → veröffentlicht → enthüllt  	impose → durchzusetzen → zwangsweise einzuführen  	staff → Personal → Mitarbeiter  		**Explanation:**		1. **"revealed" → "veröffentlicht" → "enthüllt"**: "veröffentlicht" means "published," while "enthüllt" means "revealed," which more accurately reflects the unveiling of plans.		2. **"impose" → "durchzusetzen" → "zwangsweise einzuführen"**: "durchzusetzen" means "to enforce," while "zwangsweise einzuführen" means "to forcibly introduce," aligning more closely with the notion of imposition.		3. **"staff" → "Personal" → "Mitarbeiter"**: While "Personal" can refer to "staff," "Mitarbeiter" is a more common and contextually accurate term for "staff" in this setting, particularly when paired with "Patients."
first → ersten → ersten  	junior doctors → Ärzte in der Ausbildung → Assistenzärzte  	overnight → heute auf morgen → Nacht  	unsociable → nicht zu trennenden → ungastlichen  		**Explanation:**		1. **junior doctors → Ärzte in der Ausbildung → Assistenzärzte**: "Ärzte in der Ausbildung" translates to "doctors in training," but "junior doctors" specifically refers to "Assistenzärzte" (junior doctors), a more precise term used in the medical industry for post-training physicians still in the early stages of their careers. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.		2. **overnight → heute auf morgen → Nacht**: The phrase "heute auf morgen" (from today to tomorrow) does not convey the intended meaning of "overnight," which should be captured by "Nacht" (night), as shown in the reference. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		3. **unsociable → nicht zu trennenden → ungastlichen**: "Nicht zu trennenden" (not separable) is not a correct translation of "unsociable" in this context. The term should reflect the concept of difficult, inconvenient times, which "ungastlichen" (inhospitable) does appropriately. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as the incorrect term changes the sentence's meaning regarding work hours.
(BMA-Ausschusses → BMA Kommittees → BMA's junior doctors" committee)  	"Arbeitskräftekrise → Belegschaftskrise → workforce crisis"  	nicht fair → gerecht → fails to treat all doctors fairly  		**Explanation:**  	1. "BMA-Ausschusses" translates to "BMA committee," whereas the source specifies "BMA's junior doctors' committee," which the reference translation captures as "BMA Kommittees für Assistenzärzte," directly indicating the juniors focus.	2. "Arbeitskräftekrise" (workforce crisis) is a valid translation, but the reference uses "Belegschaftskrise," which is also accurate. However, it is not a significant error in meaning but follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	3. "nicht fair behandelt" directly translates as "not treating fairly," while the reference uses "gerecht behandelt," which means "treat fairly." However, both convey that the contract fails in fair treatment, so this is not a significant change in meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Comparing the candidate translation with the reference, there are no significant single-word mistranslations that change the meaning of the sentence. The candidate sentence accurately conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Variations in phrasing, such as "mangelnden Willen" instead of "Widerwillen sich zu beteiligen," do not significantly change the intended meaning. Therefore, no meaningful single-word mistranslation errors are present.
Hunt → Jagd → Hunt		**Explanation:** "Jagd" (hunt) is a mistranslation of the proper noun "Hunt", which should not be translated. This aligns with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it changes the subject of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Belastung" (load/burden) and "Aufzwingung" (imposition) convey the idea of an unwelcome imposition, fitting the context. Similarly, "Bedenken" (concerns) and "Sorgen" (worries) can be seen as interchangeable in context. The terms for "junior doctors" and "assistenzärzte" are equivalent, as "junge Ärzte" can informally refer to junior doctors or those in early career stages, which aligns with the context. Therefore, the candidate translation retains the meaning and intent of the source and reference sentences, meeting the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
junior → Ärzte → Assistenzärzte  	industrial → industrielle → Arbeitskampf  		**Explanation:** "Ärzte" (doctors) is a mistranslation of "junior doctors" as it lacks the specificity of "Assistenzärzte" (junior doctors), violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Industrielle" (industrial) is a mistranslation of "industrial action", where "Arbeitskampf" (industrial action/strike action) fits the context, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
strike → Streik → Streikposten  	appointments → Ernennungen → Terminen  	consultants → Berater → Fachärzte  	provide → versorgen → gewähren  	doctors → Ärzte → Ärzten  	picket line → Picketlinie → Streikpostenkette  		**Explanation:**  	- "strike" was translated to "Streik", which is correct. However, the context points towards "Streikposten", meaning the focus was on the picket aspect, not just the strike itself.	- "appointments" was mistranslated as "Ernennungen" (appointments in the sense of positions), whereas "Terminen" (scheduled meetings) is correct.	- "consultants" was translated as "Berater", meaning advisors, but "Fachärzte" (specialized doctors) is more accurate.	- "provide" was translated as "versorgen" (to provide care), whereas "gewähren" (to grant or allow) fits better in the context of granting cover.	- "doctors" was mistranslated to "Ärzte", which is fine in isolation, but the grammatical form should have been "Ärzten" because it's in the dative case needing coverage.	- "picket line" was mistranslated as "Picketlinie", a direct Anglicism, whereas "Streikpostenkette" is the correct term in German, describing the context appropriately.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The words used, such as "Konflikt" for "dispute" and "Beamten" for "officials," are contextually appropriate and retain the overall meaning. There are no significant changes in meaning that violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** or **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
54,000 → 54 000 → 54.000  		**Explanation:** While "junior doctors" could be translated as "Ärzte in der Ausbildung" and "Assistantärzte", this is not a significant error, as both can refer to doctors undergoing training. However, the candidate sentence uses "54 000" (without a dot) while the reference uses "54.000" (with a dot). Although this could be considered a variation in formatting, German typically uses a period as a thousands separator, making "54 000" technically a mistranslation here. Other potential discrepancies like "wants" to "will" versus "möchte" are acceptable variations of "wants".
chief executive → Chef → Generaldirektor  	junior doctors → jungen Ärzte → Assistenzärzte  	called on → aufgefordert → forderte dazu auf  	not to go ahead → keine durchzuführen → den zu beenden  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Chef" (boss) vs. "Generaldirektor" (chief executive): "Chef" can mean boss or chief, but "Generaldirektor" is a more precise translation for "chief executive" in a formal professional setting.  	2. "jungen Ärzte" (young doctors) vs. "Assistenzärzte" (junior doctors): While "jungen Ärzte" literally translates as "young doctors," the intended meaning was "junior doctors," which in the medical context is better represented as "Assistenzärzte."  	3. "aufgefordert" (prompted/requested) vs. "forderte dazu auf" (called on): The reference provides a more direct translation of "called on," matching the tone more closely.  	4. The phrase "keine Streiks durchzuführen" (not to conduct strikes) suggests refraining from future actions, whereas "den Streik zu beenden" (to end the strike) is more in line with the idea of stopping an ongoing or planned action, which better matches the original nuance.
1. Industrial → Industriemaßnahmen → Arbeitskampfmaßnahmen	2. achieves → bewirken → erreichen	3. stretched → ausgedehnte → überbelastete	4. services → Dienstleistungen → Dienstleister	5. causes → verursachen → bereiten	6. distress → Schmerzen → Not	7. disruption → Störungen → Unterbrechung		**Explanation:** Each listed word represents a mistranslation that significantly alters the intended meaning or accuracy of the sentence, as they either convey a wrong concept or don't align well with the context provided in the reference translation.
(Junior Doctors Committee → Junior-Ausschuss → Kommittee der Assistenzärzte)  	(Guardian Role → Guardian Role → Vormundschaft)		**Explanation:**  	1. "Junior Doctors Committee" is translated as "Junior-Ausschuss," whereas the reference uses "Kommittee der Assistenzärzte." The word "Kommittee der Assistenzärzte" specifically refers to the context of junior doctors, unlike the more generic "Junior-Ausschuss," which fails to convey the precise meaning tied to the medical profession.	   	2. "Guardian Role" remains untranslated ("Guardian Role") in the candidate translation, while the reference uses "Vormundschaft." This results in a loss of the intended meaning related to guardianship roles discussed.
deployment → Einsatz → Entsendung  	training → Ausbildung → Schulungen  	career breaks → Karrierezeit → berufliche Auszeit  	syllabus → Qualifikationen → Lehrplans  		**Explanation:** "Einsatz" is a mistranslation of "deployment"; the correct German term would be "Entsendung". "Ausbildung" is a mistranslation of "training" in this context; "Schulungen" is more accurate here. "Karrierezeit" does not accurately convey "career breaks"; "berufliche Auszeit" is the correct translation. "Qualifikationen" incorrectly replaces "syllabus"; "Lehrplans" is the appropriate term. These errors are significant as they convey different meanings than intended.
- drug → Droge → Medikament  	- heart attack → Herzschlag → Herzinfarktrisiko  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Droge" (drug) is a mistranslation of "Medikament" (medicine), which aligns with the context of a prescription or medical treatment. This is a significant error as it shifts the context from a medicine to a potentially harmful substance.	2. "Herzschlag" (heartbeat) is a mistranslation of "heart attack" (Herzinfarktrisiko). The intended meaning involves reducing the risk of a heart attack, not influencing the heartbeat. This is a meaningful error affecting the sentence's intent.
(£2-a-day → 2-tägigen → £2-pro Tag)  	drug → Medikamentenregelung → Medikament  	given → erhalten → verabreichen  		**Explanation:**  	1. **£2-a-day → 2-tägigen → £2-pro Tag**: "2-tägigen" (two-day) is a mistranslation of "£2-a-day". The source refers to cost per day, and the candidate incorrectly indicates duration.	2. **drug → Medikamentenregelung → Medikament**: "Medikamentenregelung" (medication regimen) incorrectly translates "drug". The source emphasizes a specific drug rather than a regimen.	3. **given → erhalten → verabreichen**: "erhalten" (receive) is a mistranslation of "given", as it misrepresents the phrasing where the focus should be on administering or providing ("verabreichen").
anti-clotting → Abholzes → gerinnungshemmende  	drug → Medikamenten → Medikament  	ticagrelor → [Missing] → Ticagrelor  	repeat → wiederholten → wiederholter  	heart → Herzkrankheiten → Herzerkrankung  	attacks → Angriffen → Herzinfarkte  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Abholzes" (clear-cutting) is a mistranslation of "anti-clotting". This change in meaning violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it removes the medical context.  	2. "Medikamenten" (drugs) is a general term, and the candidate omits "ticagrelor", an essential part of the reference sentence. The candidate fails to specify the drug name, "ticagrelor", which is critical in context.  	3. "wiederholten" (repeated) translates correctly but is part of a phrase "Angriffen", which does not fit the intended meaning of "repeat attacks" in the medical sense. "Herzinfarkte" (heart attacks) fits better contextually.  	4. "Herzkrankheiten" (heart diseases) is a broader term than "Herzerkrankung" (heart condition/disease), marking a subtle but essential contextual shift.  	5. "Angriffen" (attacks) is a mistranslation for "repeat attacks", particularly since "Herzinfarkte" (heart attacks) is the specific type of attack referenced in medical context.  
heart attack → Herzangriff → Herzinfarkt  	stroke → Anschlags → Schlaganfalls  	another attack → anderen Angriffs → weiteren Herzinfarkts  		**Explanation:** "Herzangriff" (heart attack) is a literal but uncommon translation and is less precise than "Herzinfarkt". "Anschlags" (attack) is a mistranslation of "stroke", as "Schlaganfall" is the correct medical term. "anderen Angriffs" (another attack) incorrectly translates "another attack" in this medical context, where "weiteren Herzinfarkts" (another heart attack) is more precise.
NHS → NHS-Überwachungsbehörde → Regulierungsbehörde  	cardiovascular → Herz-Kreislauf → kardiovaskulärer  		**Explanation:**  	1. "NHS-Überwachungsbehörde" (NHS watchdog authority) should be "Regulierungsbehörde" (regulatory authority of NHS), as the reference translation uses "Regulierungsbehörde" to describe NICE, and "Überwachungsbehörde" implies a different nuance of oversight rather than regulation.	2. "Herz-Kreislauf" is a synonym for "kardiovaskulärer", but "kardiovaskulärer" is more precise in medical context. The mistranslation here lies in the choice of adjective, as "kardiovaskulärer" aligns more accurately with medical terminology favored in a regulatory text.
advised → empfohlen → empfohlen  	given → übergeben → Einnahme  	people → Menschen → (phrase-level discrepancy, no single-word replacement)  		**Explanation:**  	1. The word "advised" is correctly translated as "empfohlen", so it matches the reference and is not a mistranslation.	2. The word "given" is translated as "übergeben" (hand over), which in the context of medication or treatment should be "Einnahme" (intake), reflecting the reference translation's meaning of having people take the medication.	3. The term "to people" in the source context suggests administering medication, whereas "to people" in the candidate ("an die Menschen") might suggest physically passing something. This is a phrase-level discrepancy affecting the interpretation but isn't reducible to a single-word error. Thus, it's noted but doesn't yield a specific word replacement according to the instructions.
heart attack → Herzangriffen → Herzinfarkt  	have → heimgesucht → erleiden  	attack → angegriffen → Herzinfarkt  	stroke → angegriffen → Schlaganfall  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Herzangriffen" is a mistranslation of "heart attack" as "Herzinfarkt" is the correct medical term for a heart attack. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "heimgesucht" (meaning afflicted by) is a mistranslation of "have" in this medical context; "erleiden" is more accurate for having a heart attack. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	3. "angegriffen" is a mistranslation where "attack" refers again to a heart attack, which should be "Herzinfarkt" in German. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	4. "angegriffen" is also a mistranslation here, where it is used to translate "stroke," which should be "Schlaganfall," the correct medical term. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
plaques → Plaske → Beläge  	fatty → Fettsmaterial → fetthaltigen  	artery → Schachmauern → Arterienwänden  	strokes → Herzstreiks → Schlaganfälle  		**Explanation:**  	- "Plaske" does not appear to be a correct translation for "plaques"; the correct term is "Beläge". This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by identifying the incorrect translation of "plaque".	- "Fettsmaterial" is an incorrect translation for "fatty" when it should be "fetthaltigen", which is more precise as a description of the material causing the issue.	- "Schachmauern" is a mistranslation of "artery walls". "Schachmauern" translates to "chess walls," which is contextually incorrect compared to the reference's "Arterienwänden" (artery walls).	- "Herzstreiks" is not a valid translation of "strokes"; it should be "Schlaganfälle". This serious mistranslation significantly alters the medical meaning.
plaque → Plakette → Belag  	blood clot → Blutgerinnung → Blutgerinnsel  	heart attack → Herzschlag → Herzinfarkt  		**Explanation:**   	1. "Plakette" is a mistranslation of "plaque". In the medical context provided, "Belag" is the correct translation referring to arterial plaque. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule because "Plakette" typically refers to a plate or plaque in a non-medical sense.  	2. "Blutgerinnung" (blood coagulation) is incorrect for "blood clot". The correct term is "Blutgerinnsel" which is a clot that can block blood flow. Changing the meaning of this term significantly affects the impact described in the sentence, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.  	3. "Herzschlag" (heartbeat) is mistranslated from "heart attack", which should be "Herzinfarkt". This change significantly alters the medical condition being referred to, meeting the rules of both **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.
clot → Uhr → Blutgerinnsel  	dislodges → abbröckelt → löst  	travel → fahren → fließen  	block → fließen lassen → verstopfen  	stroke → Schlag → Schlaganfall  		**Explanation:**  	- "Uhr" (clock) is a mistranslation of "clot" (Blutgerinnsel), violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as clocks do not pertain to blood circulation.	- "abbröckelt" (crumbles) does not convey the intended meaning of "dislodges" (löst), which is about detachment.	- "fahren" (drive) is incorrect for "travel" (fließen) in the bloodstream context, where the movement of liquid is more appropriate.	- "fließen lassen" (let flow) is a mistranslation of "block" (verstopfen), altering the intended outcome of the flow.	- "Schlag" (impact/blow) does not accurately represent "stroke" (Schlaganfall) in the medical sense, altering the severity and specificity of the condition described.
attack → Angriff → Herzinfarkt  		**Explanation:** "Angriff" (attack) is a mistranslation of "Herzinfarkt" (heart attack) which significantly changes the medical context intended in the sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "Angriff" refers to a more general or different kind of attack compared to the specific medical condition.
Ticagrelor → Ticaglor → Ticagrelor  	clots → Bekleidungen → Blutgerinnseln  		**Explanation:** "Ticaglor" is a mistranslation of "Ticagrelor". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since it incorrectly represents a proper noun. "Bekleidungen" (clothing) is a mistranslation of "clots", which affects the medical context. Thus, these errors follow the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules.
Ticagrelor → Teppichbehälter → Ticagrelor  	60mg → 600 mg → 60mg  		**Explanation:** "Teppichbehälter" (carpet container) is a clear mistranslation of "Ticagrelor", which is a medication and crucial for the sentence's meaning. This clearly violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The dosage "60mg" was mistranslated as "600 mg," which significantly alters the recommended dosing regimen, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule due to its impact on the sentence's medical instruction.
1. director → Direktor → Direktorin  	2. technology → Forschungszentrums → Gesundheitstechnologieevaluierungszentrums  	3. stroke → -schlag → Schlaganfall  		**Explanation:**  	- "Direktor" is a mistranslation of "director" since the gender of "Professor Carole Longson" should match "Direktorin" for the correct reference. This fits the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "Forschungszentrums" (research center) does not accurately translate "technology evaluation centre". The significant term is "technology", which should be part of "Gesundheitstechnologieevaluierungszentrums" to properly reflect the intended meaning. Therefore, "technology" is pinpointed as the error following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "-schlag" (stroke) is an incomplete translation of "Schlaganfall" (stroke). The translation does not convey the correct medical term, making this a significant error impacting the sentence's accuracy in context.		
recurrence → Wiederholung → erneuten Herzinfarkt		**Explanation:** "Wiederholung" (repetition) is a mistranslation of "recurrence" in the context of medical conditions, where "erneuten Herzinfarkt" (recurrence of a heart attack) is the accurate reference term. The translation error significantly alters the meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it shifts the focus from a health condition to a generic act of repetition.
evidence → Beweise → Erfahrung  	ticagrelor → Anzeiger → Ticagrelor  	strokes → -streiks → Schlaganfälle  		**Explanation:** "Beweise" (proofs) is a mistranslation of "evidence" in this context, where "Erfahrung" (experience) fits better with the provided reference. "Anzeiger" (indicator) is a mistranslation of "Ticagrelor", which is a specific medication. "-streiks" (strikes) is a mistranslation of "strokes", which changes the medical context significantly.
ticagrelor → Abkommen → Ticagrelor  		**Explanation:** "Abkommen" (agreement) is a mistranslation of "ticagrelor", a specific medication. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the candidate translation significantly alters the meaning by referencing an agreement rather than a drug.
information → Informationen → Information  	ticagrelor → Flugschreiber → Ticagrelor  	bleeding → Überschwemmung → Blutung  		**Explanation:**  	- "Informationen" (plural) is a mistranslation of "information" (singular), which should be "Information", violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.  	- "Flugschreiber" (black box/flight recorder) is a mistranslation of "ticagrelor", which retains the specific name as "Ticagrelor", violating the **Identify Mistranslations** rule.  	- "Überschwemmung" (flood) is a mistranslation of "bleeding", which should be "Blutung", violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it completely changes the context.
vote → Betrug → Wahlbetrug  		**Explanation:** "Betrug" (fraud) is a mistranslation of "vote fraud", which in context refers specifically to "Wahlbetrug" (electoral fraud). This changes the meaning by not specifying the type of fraud, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
1. Ex-Tower Hamlets → der Ex-Tower Hamlets → ehemaliger Bürgermeister von Tower Hamlets  	2. Lutfur Rahman → Lutfell-Rahman → Lutfur Rahman  	3. report → veranlasste → auf Veranlassung eines Regierungsberichts  		**Explanation:**  	- "Ex-Tower Hamlets" should be translated to focus on the former position, "ehemaliger Bürgermeister von Tower Hamlets," rather than "der Ex-Tower Hamlets."	- "Lutfell-Rahman" is a misspelling of "Lutfur Rahman," which is incorrect based on the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "report" is mistranslated as "veranlasste" (prompted), when the context suggests it should be closer to "auf Veranlassung eines Regierungsberichts," focusing on the report itself, rather than the action it prompted.
widespread → --- → weitverbreiteter  	being turned to → wissentlich ignoriert → ---  	devastating → verheerender → vernichtender  		**Explanation:**  	1. "widespread" is missing ("---") in the candidate translation, while it is translated as "weitverbreiteter" in the reference translation, significantly changing the meaning.  	2. "being turned to" (in the context of ignoring) is mistranslated as "wurde verschlossen" ("was closed") instead of "wissentlich ignoriert" ("knowingly ignored"), altering the intended action described. This shows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as the omission affects understanding.	3. "devastating" is translated as "verheerender" in the candidate sentence but "vernichtender" in the reference sentence. While both could mean "devastating," this is included due to the context where the nuanced intensity of "vernichtender" fits better.
lambasts → plündert → greift verbal an  	town halls → Stadthallen → Rathäuser  		**Explanation:** "plündert" (loots) is a mistranslation of "lambasts", which should be more about a verbal attack rather than looting. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it substantially changes the nature of the action. "Stadthallen" (city halls) is a mistranslation of "town halls", where "Rathäuser" is the more contextually accurate term, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
communities → Gemeinschaftssekretär → Minister für Integration und Kommunalregierung	cordons → Abstriche → Absperrbänder		**Explanation:** "Gemeinschaftssekretär" (community secretary) is a mistranslation when compared to "Minister für Integration und Kommunalregierung" (Minister for Integration and Local Government), which changes the specific role being referenced. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Abstriche" (concessions or compromises) does not correctly convey the meaning of "cordons" (security perimeters), which aligns with **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**, as it affects the nature of police actions described. "Absperrbänder" (barriers or tape) is contextually appropriate for maintaining security.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the meaning of requiring voters to take identification in order to prove their identity when voting. Both "Ausweise nehmen" and "einen Ausweis mit sich führen" are valid expressions for carrying or taking an ID, and the overall intent of the sentence remains intact. Therefore, no single-word translation errors are detected.
name → Ansprache → Anschrift  		**Explanation:** "Ansprache" is a mistranslation of "address". The correct German translation in this context is "Anschrift". This significantly impacts the meaning because "Ansprache" refers to a speech or address in the sense of a formal presentation and not a location or domicile, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
suggests → vor → schlägt  	indelible → zu → nicht entfernbare  	ink → klopfen → Tinte  	ballot → abstimmt → Wahlstimme  	vote → abstimmen → wählt  		**Explanation:**  	1. "vor" in the candidate sentence is a correct translation for "suggests," but since it is part of a mistranslated phrase, it was highlighted due to contextual absence.	2. "zu" (meaning “to”) does not reflect "indelible," which is more accurately translated as "nicht entfernbare" (non-removable).	3. "klopfen" (meaning “to knock”) is a mistranslation of "ink," intended as "Tinte."	4. "abstimmt" (votes/cast) is not an accurate translation for "ballot," which should be represented as "Wahlstimme" (ballot/vote).	5. "abstimmen" refers back to "vote," translated to "wählt," ensuring the casting action is reflected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and the reference translation convey the same meaning in context. Although the word order and phrasing are different, the critical elements "Whistleblower," "geschützt werden sollten," and "Sir Eric sagte" align with the intended meaning. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as the variations do not significantly alter the meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation correctly conveys the intended meaning and adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. The variations between "Ratspapieren" and "Gemeindeunterlagen" or "Beschlüssen" and "Entscheidungen" do not significantly alter the meaning. Both candidate and reference translations preserve the original context and intent of the source sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation appropriately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While there are minor differences in word choice, such as "örtliche Verwaltung" (local administration) versus "kommunale Regierung" (communal government), both translations accurately capture the essence of the original sentence. There are no significant single-word mistranslations violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** or **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
Tower Hamlets → Tourhollets → Tower Hamlets		**Explanation:** "Tourhollets" is a mistranslation of "Tower Hamlets" due to spelling error and does not correspond with the original name in either the source sentence or the reference translation. This violates the **Identify Mistranslations** rule as it does not accurately reflect the name of the place.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source sentence and is sufficiently close to the reference translation. The variations in wording do not result in a significant change in meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, capturing the key elements and context. The wording and structure used in the translation, such as "zynisch pervertiert", "religiöse Gefühl", and "zum Schweigen gebracht", are consistent with the source and reference. There are no significant single-word mistranslations that change the meaning of the sentence, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
faithful → treuen → -  		**Explanation:** The word "treuen" (faithful) is a mistranslation since the reference translation omits a direct counterpart to "faithful," indicating that including it may alter the nuance. Nonetheless, the reference sentence still implies this without the explicit word, suggesting a possible deviation following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.  		basis → Begründung → Grundlage  		**Explanation:** "Begründung" (justification/reason) is a mistranslation of "basis". The intended word "Grundlage" implies a foundation or basis, altering the meaning in context, which fits the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
dubious → zweifelhaft → zweifelhaft  	personation → Person → Nachahmung  		**Explanation:** "zweifelhaft" correctly translates "dubious", so no error is detected for that. However, "Person" is incorrectly used for "personation", which is better translated as "Nachahmung" in this context. This follows the **Identify Mistranslations** rule and focuses on the single-word error format by extracting "Person" from the problematic phrase "Ergebnis einer Person".
evidence → Anzeichen → Beweise		**Explanation:** "Anzeichen" (indications) is a mistranslation of "evidence", which significantly changes the weight of the claim. "Evidence" implies a stronger, more substantial proof than "Anzeichen", which aligns with **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.
1. voiced → beunruhigt → äußerte	2. particular → besonders → insbesondere	3. alarm → beunruhigt → alarmierend  	4. postal → Postbereich → Briefwahl  	5. senior → hohe → ältere  	6. exerted → ausgeübt → gemacht  	7. people → Menschen → Leute  		**Explanation:**		1. "beunruhigt" (worried or concerned) is a mistranslation of "voiced", which in this context means "expressed". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	2. "besonders" (especially) is a mistranslation of "particular", which is more accurately "insbesondere" when referring to a specific concern.	3. "beunruhigt" (worried) is used instead of "alarmierend" (alarming), which is critical as "alarm" conveys stronger urgency.	4. "Postbereich" (postal area) does not precisely translate "postal voting", which refers specifically to "Briefwahl".	5. "hohe" (high-ranking) does not convey the same meaning as "senior" in terms of age or experience, which is intended by "ältere".	6. "ausgeübt" (exerted) is an acceptable translation, but "gemacht" (made) is closer to the style and structure here.	7. "Menschen" (humans) can fit, but "Leute" (people) is a more common and direct translation in this context.
abgebildet → bilanziert → abgebildet  	voting → Abstimmungssystem → Wahlsystem
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** When comparing the candidate translation with the reference translation, there are no single-word mistranslations that significantly change the meaning in context. The sentence is translated accurately, and the variations observed do not alter the intended meaning or violate any translation instructions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation matches the key elements of the reference translation. The phrases about "politically correct" sensitivities related to ethnicity and religion are conveyed correctly, and the meaning of the source sentence is maintained. There are no significant single-word translation errors present.
recommendations → Empfehlungen → Empfehlungen  	activists → Aktivisten → Aktivisten  	ballot → Stimmzetteln → Briefwahlunterlagen  		**Explanation:** "Stimmzetteln" (ballot papers) is a mistranslation of "Briefwahlunterlagen" (postal ballot papers). This substitution significantly loses the specific context and function of the ballots, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Other words are correct in context or acceptable variations given the strict format.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the key elements and meaning of the source sentence. The differences in wording, such as "geprüft wird" versus "in Erwägung gezogen wird" for "being considered", and "strengere Registrierungskontrollen" versus "härtere Registrierungsüberprüfungen" for "tougher checks", are acceptable synonym variations given the context. The translation accurately conveys the intended meaning without significant deviation, thereby adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
voters → Wähler → Wähler   	produce → zu zwingen → nach Ihrem Ausweis zu fragen  		**Explanation:** "Wähler" correctly translates to "voters," so it should be omitted from the error list. However, "zu zwingen" (to compel) is a mistranslation of "to produce," changing the emphasis from "showing" ID to a more forceful "compelling," violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it alters the intended action. The task additionally requires highlighting that the phrase involving "produce" is incorrect overall, even if not a perfect single-word equivalent can be provided here.
indelible → unleugbare → nicht entfernbare  		**Explanation:** "unleugbare" is a mistranslation of "indelible". The term "unleugbare" translates closer to "undeniable", which is not contextually appropriate for describing ink. "Nicht entfernbare", meaning "non-removable", aligns correctly with the idea of permanence intended by "indelible".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence in terms of the action required ("Setzen Sie...um" aligns with "carry out"), the object of that action ("systematische Überprüfungen der Staatsangehörigkeit" corresponds well with "systematic checks on nationality"), and the purpose ("um sicherzustellen, dass sie wahlberechtigt sind" correctly translates "to ensure they are eligible to vote"). Despite a slight structural difference due to verb positioning, the translation remains faithful to the intended meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule by maintaining contextual accuracy.
requests → Anträge → Antrag  	postal vote → Post → Briefwahl  		**Explanation:** "Anträge" is the plural form of "Antrag" (request), and while "requests" could contextually be plural, the key point here is the process it refers to. The input's action (put a limit) refers collectively, so "Antrag" captures the referential form more accurately, keeping focus on "limit on request". "Post" is a mistranslation within the context as it means "mail" generally, not specifically "postal vote," which is captured by "Briefwahl".
political campaigners → politische Aktivisten → politische Kampagnenführer  	completed → mit → vollständige  	postal votes → Postgeldern → Briefwahlen  	postal vote envelopes → Post → Umschläge von Briefwahlen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "political campaigners" is mistranslated as "politische Aktivisten" (political activists), whereas the correct reference is "politische Kampagnenführer". This alteration in meaning significantly changes the intended target of the ban.	2. "completed" is mistranslated as "mit" (with), which does not fit the context in this sentence. The reference uses "vollständige" (completed).	3. "postal votes" is mistranslated as "Postgeldern" (postal money), which is a significant alteration. The reference uses "Briefwahlen" (postal votes).	4. "postal vote envelopes" is mistranslated from "Post" (post/mail) to "Umschläge von Briefwahlen" (envelopes of postal votes).
powers → Macht → Befugnis  	set up → korrigieren → einzurichten  	cordons → Wahllokale → Absperrungen  
people → Menschen → Einschüchterung  	charge → anzuklagen → Anklage  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Menschen" (people) in the candidate translation should align with the specific legal context referenced in the source and reference translations. The reference translation implies "Anklage" (indictment) rather than "Menschen" (people), relating the action of charging or indicting on the basis of intimidation.		2. "Anzuklagen" (to charge) is a verb form in the candidate translation, while "Anklage" (indictment) in the reference denotes a noun, aligning with "charge" as a legal action, not the process, thus fitting better within the legal context of the "Representation of the People Act 1983".
take pictures → die Bilder → Fotografier		**Explanation:** "die Bilder" (the pictures) is a mistranslation of "take pictures". This significantly changes the meaning of the instruction, turning it from an act (to take pictures) to objects (the pictures themselves) being illegal. The translation fails to convey the prohibition of the act of photographing, therefore violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively captures the meaning and significant components of the source sentence. While there are some structural differences between the candidate and reference translations, they do not constitute errors in word choice that significantly alter the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, no translation errors are detected.
Strengthen → stärken → Intensivierung  	training → Ausbildung → Trainings  	booth → Reihe → Wahlkabine  		**Explanation:**  	1. "stärken" (to strengthen) is a mistranslation of "strengthen", as it does not convey the idea of intensifying or making more rigorous which "Intensivierung" (intensification) does.  	2. "Ausbildung" (education/training) is a broader term compared to "Trainings" which in this particular context refers more clearly to the training exchanged between staff.	3. "Reihe" (row/turn) is a mistranslation of "booth". The reference "Wahlkabine" (voting booth) is more contextually appropriate, ensuring voters enter the correct location.
savages → rettet → fällt über  	Metropolitan Police → Metropolitanische Polizei → Metropolitan Police  	charges → Vorwürfe → Strafanzeige  		**Explanation:**  	- "rettet" (saves) is a mistranslation of "savages". It changes the meaning from criticizing to helping, conflicting with the intended context, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "fällt über" (literally translates to "falls upon") more closely conveys the idea of aggressive criticism.	- "Metropolitanische Polizei" is not the correct translation for "Metropolitan Police", which is a proper noun and should be left as "Metropolitan Police" or translated to "Metropolitan-Polizei" but not "Metropolitanische Polizei". Since the mistranslation affects understanding, it goes against the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Vorwürfe" (accusations) does not correctly translate "charges". The context refers to legal charges, which would be better translated as "Strafanzeige", adhering to the **Contextual Accuracy** requirement.
agent → Agenten → Stellvertreter		**Explanation:** In the given context, "agent" should be translated as "Stellvertreter" (representative or deputy) rather than "Agenten" (agent), which can suggest a different role or meaning not intended in the source sentence. This falls under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the mistranslation changes the role being described.
reasonable doubt → keiner erheblichen Zweifel → hinreichend  	criminal standard → strafrechtlicher Ebene → hohen Anforderungen im strafrechtlichen Verfahren  		**Explanation:** The term "reasonable doubt" should be translated to convey the meaning of "hinreichend" (beyond a reasonable doubt), but it was omitted in the candidate translation, leading to a failure in expressing this crucial legal standard. Additionally, "strafrechtlicher Ebene" (criminal level) does not capture the full sense of "hohen Anforderungen im strafrechtlichen Verfahren" (criminal standard of proof), altering the conveyed standard. Both errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by omitting important legal context.
tick-box → tickbox → Abhakkontrollen		electoral registration departments → Wahlkreiseinrichtungen → Wahlregistrierungsabteilungen		town hall → Städten → Rathäuser		**Explanation:** 		1. "tickbox" is incorrectly used in the candidate translation, while "Abhakkontrollen" is the correct German translation for "tick-box".	2. "Wahlkreiseinrichtungen" (electoral district establishments) is a mistranslation of "electoral registration departments," which significantly alters the meaning in the context of the sentence. The correct translation is "Wahlregistrierungsabteilungen".	3. "Städten" (cities) is a mistranslation of "town hall" and not part of an acceptable variation when compared in context with "Rathäuser" (town halls).
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "im vergangenen Jahr" and "vom letzten Jahr" are valid translations for "last year," and "Weckruf" and "Warnsignal" convey similar meanings in this context. The intended alert or call to attention is maintained, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
nation → Nation → Land  	worrying → beunruhigende → besorgniserregende  	bodies → Organe → Behörden  		**Explanation:** "Nation" (Nation) is a lighter mistranslation of "country" (Land) in this specific context, focusing on a more geographical or territorial sense than the political unity often implied by "nation." "Beunruhigende" (worrying) should be "besorgniserregende" (alarming), which more accurately conveys the serious concern mentioned. "Organe" (organs) is a mistranslation of "bodies" in this context, where "Behörden" (authorities) or institutions by "bodies" would be more appropriate, as it refers to authoritative entities in charge.
cyclist → zyklistisches → Radler  	lookalike → Schlaggespenst → Doppelgängerin  	celeb → Helfershelfer → berühmte  	Olympians → Rio-Olympi → Olympiasportlern  		**Explanation:**  	1. "zyklistisches" (relating to cycling) is a mistranslation of "cyclist", which should be "Radler" (biker/cyclist).	2. "Schlaggespenst" (battering phantom) is a mistranslation of "lookalike", which should be "Doppelgängerin" (female lookalike).	3. "Helfershelfer" (accomplice) is a mistranslation of "celeb" (celebrity), which should be "berühmte" (famous or celebrity).	4. "Rio-Olympi" is an incomplete and incorrect fragment for "Olympians" and should be expanded to "Olympiasportlern" (Olympian athletes).
Fans → Zyklists → Radsportlerin  	lookalike → Ausblick → Doppelgängerin  	Duchess → Oberhof → Herzogin  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Zyklist" (male cyclist) is a mistranslation of the gender-specific "Radsportlerin" (female cyclist), which is important here since it refers to Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, a female cyclist. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by using the wrong gender.  	2. "Ausblick" (view) is a mistranslation of "lookalike", which should be "Doppelgängerin" (female lookalike). This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule as the key concept of resemblance is lost.  	3. "Oberhof" (court) does not translate "Duchess". The reference to "Herzogin" (Duchess) is crucial to understand who Pauline resembles, thus it violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it completely changes the meaning.
(24-year-old → 24-jährige Olympische Olympische → 24-jährige Olympionikin)		**Explanation:** "24-jährige Olympische Olympische" mistranslates "24-year-old Olympian." The repeated use of "Olympische" does not accurately reflect the noun "Olympian." The correct word in context would be "Olympionikin" for the female athlete. The redundancy "Olympische Olympische" is also incorrect.	
games → Spiele → Olympischen Spiele	crossing → überqueren → flimmern	celebs → Feiern → Berühmtheiten		**Explanation:** 	1. "Spiele" translates to "games," but the source is specifically referring to the Rio Olympics, so the correct reference word is "Olympischen Spiele."	2. "Überqueren" translates to "crossing," which is a literal translation but not contextually fitting here. The reference uses "flimmern," more appropriate for describing images appearing on screens.	3. "Feiern" translates to "celebrations," rather than "celebs" (celebrities), altering the meaning in the context of resembling Hollywood figures. The correct word here should be "Berühmtheiten."
hunter → Jäger → Jäger  	U.S. Men's Archery Team → U.S. 's Archery-Team von Männern → US-Mannschaft im Bogenschießen  	member → Frau → Mannschaftsmitglied  	left → weg → links  	kid → Köder → Kindheit  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Jäger" is accurate, so it's not a mistranslation. ("Der Jäger und der Wolf" is correct.)	2. "U.S. 's Archery-Team von Männern" does not correspond correctly to the intended context of "U.S. Men's Archery Team"; the structure is convoluted and partially incorrect.	3. "Frau" (woman) is a mistranslation of "member," where "Mannschaftsmitglied" (team member) would be appropriate.	4. "weg" (away) does not correctly translate "left" in the context, which here should mean the position "links" (left side of the image or photo).	5. "Köder" (bait) is a mistranslation of "kid," meaning "Kindheit" (childhood) was intended.
Kates → Kates → Kate's  	Doppelgesang → Doppelgesang → Doppelgängerin  	Radfahren → Radfahren → Radrennbahn  	Erachter → Erachter → Bogenschütze  	A-Liste → A-Liste → A-Promi  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Kates" matches with the reference but is stylistically inconsistent with the English possessive "'s". However, it is acceptable to retain "Kates" as it aligns with common German transliteration conventions.	2. "Doppelgesang" (double singing) is a mistranslation of "doppelganger", changing the meaning significantly.	3. "Radfahren" (cycling) is a general term but contextually incorrect, whereas "Radrennbahn" (cycling track/racetrack) is more specific and accurate.	4. "Erachter" appears to be a misinterpretation, likely intended as "Bogenschütze" (archer).	5. "A-Liste" (A-list) suggests a direct translation not commonly used in the same way in German, where "A-Promi" (A-list celebrity) is the correct contextual term.
1. Men's → von Männern → der	2. caused → verursacht → verursacht	3. looking → schlecht → unheimlich	4. star → Stern → Star		**Explanation:**		1. "Men's" is mistranslated as "von Männern" (of men), whereas it should be rendered simply as "der" in this context (der US-Mannschaft).	2. "caused" is correctly translated to "verursacht", so there is no error here with that word.	3. "looking" is mistranslated as "schlecht" (poorly), whereas it should be "unheimlich" (eerily) to convey the correct nuance of similarity.	4. "star" is incorrectly translated as "Stern" (which is a literal translation for a celestial body), whereas "Star" is the correct term for a celebrity or actor in German.
archer → Dachdiener → Bogenschütze  	frenzy → Verdrossenheit → Wahnsinn  	kid → Köder → Kindheit  		**Explanation:**	- "Dachdiener" (roofer/roof worker) is a mistranslation of "archer," significantly altering the subject of the sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it changes the original meaning.	- "Verdrossenheit" (discontent) is not an accurate translation of "frenzy," which minimizes the intended impact of the social media reaction. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Köder" (bait) is a clear mistranslation of "kid" or "childhood," which does not fit the contextual description of age. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
I → Ich → Ich selbst  	told → sagte → teilte ... mit  	Brady → (omitted) → Brady  		**Explanation:**  		1. **('I → Ich → Ich selbst'):** The source word "I" is translated as "Ich," which is generally correct, but does not capture the emphasis added by "personally." The reference translation uses "Ich selbst," which better represents that emphasis. This may qualify as an error under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the nuance of emphasis is not fully rendered.		2. **(told → sagte → teilte ... mit):** The candidate translation uses "sagte" ('said'), while the reference uses "teilte ... mit" ('told'). While both convey that Brady communicated something, "teilte ... mit" specifies the act of informing more accurately than "sagte." This is particularly relevant because it changes the interaction context with "Huffington Post."		3. **(Brady → (omitted) → Brady):** "Brady" is omitted in the candidate translation. The reference retains "Brady," and omitting it entirely changes the subject of the action, making it a significant omission as per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** instruction.
good-looking → gut aussehender → gutaussehender  	dude → Dude → Kerl  	it's → er ist → das  	a compliment → er ist ein Kompliment → als Kompliment  		**Explanation:**  	- "gut aussehender" is a mistranslation of "good-looking" as "gutaussehender" is more accurate and is used in the reference. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "Dude" appears untranslated in the candidate sentence and should be translated as "Kerl", which is the correct context-appropriate term for "dude", thus violating the **Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "it's" is translated as "er ist," which means "he is", whereas "das" would be the appropriate translation, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "a compliment" is translated as "er ist ein Kompliment," inaccurately rendering "he is a compliment," instead of something closer to "als Kompliment" (as a compliment), which is the correct contextual interpretation.
jumper → Langjumper → Weitspringer  		**Explanation:** "Langjumper" (long jumper) is not a standard term in German, and it does not accurately translate "long jumper" in the context. The correct translation aligning with the reference is "Weitspringer", preserving the intended meaning. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
gymnast → Sänger → Turnerin  	expressive → ausdrücklichen → ausdrucksstarken  	dead → toter → Doppelgängerin  		**Explanation:**  	- "Sänger" (singer) is a mistranslation of "gymnast", meaning the profession of Aliya Mustafina changes significantly, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "ausdrücklichen" (expressed) does not correctly capture the intended meaning of "expressive" in this context, where it should be "ausdrucksstarken" (expressive), affecting the sentence's nuance and violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "toter Ringer" (dead ringer) is mistranslated; it does not aptly describe the intended idiomatic expression "dead ringer" in English, which in German is "Doppelgängerin" (lookalike), following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation's words are equivalent to the reference translation's words, taking into account common translation variations, and the overall meaning of the sentence is preserved. There are no single-word errors that significantly alter the meaning of the original sentence.
1. Nathan → NATO → Nathan  	2. actor → Anfängers → Schauspielers  		**Explanation:** "NATO" is a mistranslation of "Nathan." This changes the meaning significantly and does not fit the context as a person's name. "Anfängers" (beginner) is a mistranslation of "actor" and alters the context significantly, as it refers incorrectly to someone who is just starting rather than a person in the acting profession.
brow → Brosamen → Augenbrauen  	lips → Lippenbekenntnissen → Lippen  		**Explanation:** "Brosamen" (crumbs) is a mistranslation of "brow". In the context, "Augenbrauen" (eyebrows) is the correct term. "Lippenbekenntnissen" (lip service) is a mistranslation of "lips", where "Lippen" is the proper word in this context. These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as they do not fit the intended meaning in comparison to the source and reference.
1. medal → Medaillen → Silbermedaillenschwimmerin		2. Russia's Yulia Efimova → Julia Efimova in Russland → russische Silbermedaillenschwimmerin Yulia Efimova  	   - "Julia Efimova in Russland" fails to convey the proper noun and attributes of "Russia's Yulia Efimova".		3. sunkissed → versenkte → sonnengebräunte		4. hair → Haar → Haare  		5. Teams → Teams → dem Amerikaner  	   - "Teams" is incorrect; it should reflect that Nathan Adrian is from Team USA, thus recognizing his nationality.		6. Gorgon → Gorgon → Gordon  		**Explanation:** The translation contains several mistranslations that significantly alter or obscure the original meaning. "Medaillen" does not convey that Yulia Efimova is a silver medal swimmer. Additionally, "versenkte" (sunk) does not properly translate "sunkissed". "Teams" incorrectly introduces a plural and non-specific term. Finally, the mistranslation of "Gorgon" obscures the reference to "Joseph Gordon Levitt".
women → Hoffnung Solo → Frauen  	Soccer star → Schauplatz → Fußballstar  	left → linke → links  	Dexter actress → Dexter-Schauplatz → Dexter Schauspielerin  	right → [omitted] → rechts  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Hoffnung Solo" (Hope Solo) replaces "women", likely due to a parsing error; it misses capturing the intended plural subject.	2. "Schauplatz" (location or venue) is incorrect for "soccer star", a clear contextual error as people cannot be venues.	3. "linke" (the directive for left in an adjectival form) does not accurately translate "left" in this structural context, needing "links".	4. "Schauplatz" again fails as it stands in for "actress", which should be "Schauspielerin" given context.	5. The directional "right" is omitted in the candidate, creating an imbalance in the description.
**(only one → nur → die Einzige)**	**(user → Nutzer → User)**	**(very pleased → erfreut → glücklich)**	**(similaritiest → Ähnlichsten → Ähnlichkeiten)**		**Explanation:** 	- "nur" (only) and "die Einzige" (the only one) differ significantly in meaning. The phrase "nicht nur" means "not only", which changes the meaning from focusing on exclusivity ("die Einzige").	- "Nutzer" (user) should use "User" as per reference, indicating a stylistic choice but maintain consistency with the reference as "Twitter-User" is more contextually appropriate.	- "erfreut" (pleased) is a less intense emotion than "glücklich" (happy), thus altering the emotional intensity of the sentence.	- "Ähnlichsten" (most similar) is a mistake from "similaritiest", it should be "Ähnlichkeiten" (similarities), as it is a more accurate noun for the context.
Floating → Theorie → Theorie in den Raum gestellt  	pair's → Paares → des Paares  	looks → Aussichten → Ähnlichkeit  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Theorie" (theory) is used in the candidate, omitting the notion of "floating" or "putting a theory forward," which is expressed as "Theorie in den Raum gestellt" in the reference. This changes the meaning of the sentence by removing the implied speculative nature of the source phrase, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	2. "Paares" (pair's) is slightly incorrect because the definite article "des" is missing, which indicates possession and is vital in German sentence construction. Correct word context is "des Paares."	3. "Aussichten" (prospects/views) is used for "looks," whereas the intended meaning is "Ähnlichkeit" (similarity). This mistranslation violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by not conveying the intended meaning of resemblance in appearance.
Twitter user → Twitterer → Twitter-Userin  	her → seine → ihre  	happiness → Freude → Zufriedenheit  	Hope Solo → Hoffnung Solo → Hope Solo  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Twitter user" is mistranslated as "Twitterer". The gender-specific "Twitter-Userin" maintains the implication of the original.  	2. "her" is mistranslated as "seine", changing the gender context from female to male, which is contextually incorrect.  	3. "happiness" is mistranslated as "Freude", while "Zufriedenheit" better captures the intended nuance of "satisfaction" or "contentment."  	4. "Hope Solo" is improperly translated as "Hoffnung Solo", which incorrectly translates the proper noun and should remain "Hope Solo" in the translation.
soccer star → Fußballstar → US-Fußballstar  	actress → Schauspieler → Schauspielerin  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Fußballstar" is a mistranslation of "soccer star," where "US" or "USA" is missing, changing the specificity of who the star is. This aligns with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it alters the intended meaning.	2. "Schauspieler" (actor) is a mistranslation of "actress," which changes the gender of the person described. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since the reference sentence specifies an actress.
1. popular → Bevölkerung → beliebte  	2. comparisons → Vergleiche der Bevölkerung → Vergleiche  	3. Actress → Actress → Schauspielerin  	4. medal-winning gymnast → Goldmedailler → Goldmedaillengewinnerin im Turnen  	5. boasts → pflegt → aufweist  	6. Bring-Gabrielle → Bring-Gabrielle Union → Bring It On Star Gabrielle  		**Explanation:**  	- "Bevölkerung" (population) is a mistranslation of "popular", which significantly alters the observation being made about the comparisons.	- "Vergleiche der Bevölkerung" (comparisons of the population) misconstrues the original concept of popular comparisons.	- "Actress" is left untranslated instead of using the German "Schauspielerin".	- "Goldmedailler" does not capture the full phrase "medal-winning gymnast"; it should be "Goldmedaillengewinnerin im Turnen" to convey the correct idea.	- "pflegt" (cares for) is not appropriate in this context where "aufweist" (boasts/shows) retains the intended meaning.	- "Bring-Gabrielle Union" results from a mistranslation of "Bring It On star Gabrielle Union", where the reference to the movie should be preserved.
1. swimmer → Schweinefleisch → Schwimmerin		**Explanation:** "Schweinefleisch" (pork) is a mistranslation of "swimmer", as it is contextually incorrect when referring to a person participating in the Olympics. The reference uses "Schwimmerin" (female swimmer), but even if gender is neglected, "Schwimmer" would have been more contextually appropriate than "Schweinefleisch". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
1. analysis → Analyse von → Analyse über  	**Explanation:** "Analyse von" (analysis of) should be "Analyse über" (analysis of) because it specifies what the analysis is about. However, this does not significantly impact understanding and could be a minor stylistic choice, so "Analyse von" can be acceptable.		2. fourth → vierten Platz → vierten Platz  	**Explanation:** "der am vierten Platz der Freisyle-Stelle der Frauen am 4xm-Freetyp endet" should be "bei dem vierten Platz der 4x200m Freistilschwimmstaffel," indicating a clearer structure and proper construction. Although this involves "vierten Platz," the structure issue is more of a phrase construction rather than a single-word mistranslation.		3. Freestyle relay → Freisyle-Stelle → Freistilschwimmstaffel  	**Explanation:** "Freisyle-Stelle" is a structural error. It should have been "Freistilschwimmstaffel," following the reference.		4. 4x200m → 4xm-Freetyp → 4x200m  	**Explanation:** "4xm-Freetyp" is a mistranslation of "4x200m," affecting both distance and specificity of the event type in swimming.		5. viewers → Zuschauer über → Zuschauer der  	**Explanation:** "Zuschauer über" (viewers about) should be "Zuschauer der" (viewers of), affecting meaning slightly due to incorrect preposition use.		**Output can be simplified to highlight the clearest single-word errors, considering meaningful impact on translation:**		- fourth → vierten Platz  	- 4x200m → 4xm-Freetyp  		These errors directly impact the original context and specifics of the sentence.
female → Schwimmer → Schwimmerin		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation, "Schwimmer" (male swimmer) is used instead of "Schwimmerin" (female swimmer), which is required here to accurately convey the gender of the swimmer mentioned in the source sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes the identity of the individual described.
1. Byron → Byrne → Byron  	2. MacDonald → McDonald → MacDonald's  	3. Mic → Mik → Mikrofon  	4. freestyle → Freetyle → Freistil  	5. relay → Relaisars → Staffel  		**Explanation:**  	- "Byron" was mistranslated as "Byrne," which changes the commentator's name.	- "MacDonald" was mistranslated to "McDonald," altering the last name.	- "Mic" was shortened to "Mik," which is an incorrect abbreviation in this context; the proper word is "Mikrofon."	- "Freestyle" was mistranslated to "Freetyle," a typographical error of the intended word, which needs to be "Freistil."	- "Relay" was mistranslated to "Relaisars," which is incorrect in context; "Staffel" is the proper translation.
color → color → Farbe  	could be heard saying → könnte sagen → konnte man hören sagen  	dropped the ball → fiel den Ball → hat den Anschluß verloren  		**Explanation:**  	1. "color" should have been translated to "Farbe", as the reference uses this German word to express the intended meaning in context.	2. "could be heard saying" is translated as "könnte sagen", which changes the meaning to "could say" rather than "could be heard saying". The reference uses "konnte man hören sagen" to keep the intended meaning of the original sentence.	3. "dropped the ball" is a figurative expression translated literally as "fiel den Ball" in the candidate translation. The reference uses "hat den Anschluß verloren", which more accurately conveys the figurative meaning of failing or making a mistake in context.
excited → aufgeregt → Mief  	stink → Stein → Mief  	died → verstorben → starb  	pig → (no German word for "pig") → Schwein  		**Explanation:**  	1. "excited" is translated as "aufgeregt", but it should refer to the phrase "went out like stink" which translates to "ging ab wie Mief".	2. "stink" is incorrectly translated as "Stein" (stone) instead of "Mief" which is used in the reference translation.	3. The word "died" is translated as "verstorben" (deceased), which is generally correct, but the phrase context is more dynamically captured by "starb" in the reference.	4. "pig" is missing in the candidate translation. In the reference, it translates to "Schwein", completing the phrase "starb wie ein Schwein".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "Vielen Dank" (many thanks) and "Danke" (thanks) both appropriately convey gratitude, and "dafür" translates as "for that" in both the candidate and reference translations. The use of "Vielen Dank" rather than "Danke" does not significantly change the meaning of the sentence, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Chinese swimmer → chinesische Schwimmer → chinesische Schwimmerin  	leg → Bein → Etappe  	relay → Lais → Schwimmstaffel  		**Explanation:** "chinesische Schwimmer" is not consistent with the gender indicated in "Ai Yanhan," whereas "chinesische Schwimmerin" from the reference is appropriate. "Bein" (leg) is a mistranslation of "leg" in the context of relay racing, which should be "Etappe," indicating a segment or stage of a race. "Lais" does not accurately represent "relay," which should be "Schwimmstaffel" in the context of swimming events.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation faithfully represents the meaning of the source sentence. Variations such as "Tonfall" for "tone" and "verwendeten Sprache" for "language used" do not significantly alter the intended message. Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no translation errors are detected.
died → Schweinefleisch → gestorben  	pig → Schweinefleisch → Schwein  		**Explanation:** "Schweinefleisch" (pork) is a mistranslation of both "died" and "pig", significantly altering the intended meaning of the sentence and not fitting in context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
realize → wusste → kapiert  	air → Luft → Sendung  		**Explanation:** "wusste" (knew) is a mistranslation of "realize", changing the nuance of understanding, which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because "kapiert" is more accurate in conveying realization in this context. "Luft" (air) is a literal translation but doesn't fit this broadcasting context, whereas "Sendung" (broadcast) correctly captures the intended meaning, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
dropped → fiel → verloren		**Explanation:** "fiel" (fell) is a mistranslation of "dropped" in this context, where it means "lost" or "failed to maintain position," not literally "fell." This obeys the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "fiel den Ball" (fell the ball) is not a valid expression in German, whereas "den Anschluß verloren" maintains the intended meaning of losing an opportunity or position.
criticism → Kritik → Kritik  	on → an → auf  	came → ist → kam  	thick and fast → hart und schnell → schnell und hart  		**Explanation:**  	1. **criticism → Kritik → Kritik**: Initially seems correct, but clarification is required in structure or order. However, no issue at a single-word level here. This is an observation rather than a word error.  	2. **on → an → auf**: "an" (at/on) is used where "auf" (on) is contextually appropriate, correcting the directionality related to Twitter. Violates **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** as it incorrectly relates Twitter's described relationship.  	3. **came → ist → kam**: The verb "ist" (is) is incoherent in tense and direct translation. Instead, "kam" (came) correctly reflects the past action. This error follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "came" signifies the action/past aspect.  	4. **thick and fast → hart und schnell → schnell und hart**: Though "hart und schnell" uses correct synonyms, the phrase order reflects a meaningful nuance change from "thick and fast". Adjust order to maintain intended pace and intensity.
heard → der Gehörte → sie hörten  	users → Twitterkunden → Twitter-User  	Byron → Byrn → Byron  	Macdonald → Macdonlad → MacDonald  		**Explanation:** 	- "der Gehörte" is an incorrect rendition of "heard." The candidate translation should have used "sie hörten" to correctly maintain the sentence's meaning.	- "Twitterkunden" is a mistranslation of "Twitter users." The suggested "Twitter-User" directly corresponds with the reference, keeping the professional context intact.	- "Byrn" is a typo or mistranslation of "Byron." The reference uses the correct name, which the candidate translation fails to do.	- "Macdonlad" is a typographical error for "MacDonald." The mistranslation changes the name's identity, which is incorrect when ensuring contextual accuracy.
twitter → Titler → Twitter-Userin  	ByronMacDonald → Donald → ByronMacDonald  		**Explanation:** "Titler" is a mistranslation for "twitter," which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Titler" does not relate to "Twitter" and changes the identity of the platform. "Donald" is a mistranslation of "ByronMacDonald," incorrectly changing the name involved, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule concerning proper names.
represent → vertreten → repräsentierst  	bunch → Hülle → Gruppe  	disgusted → empört → angeekelt  		**Explanation:**  	1. "vertraten" (represent) is more formal and less precise than "repräsentierst" in this context, which misaligns the casual tone with the source.	2. "Hülle" (shell) is an inaccurate translation of "bunch," which should be "Gruppe" (group), significantly impacting the meaning by suggesting a different metaphor entirely.	3. "empört" (outraged) changes the sentiment of "#disgusted," which is better captured by "angeekelt" (disgusted).
Scott Russel → Schottland → Scott Russel  	who → der → der die CBC Sendung moderierte  	broadcast → Sendung → Ausstrahlung  	comment → in der Luft → live  		**Explanation:** "Schottland" (Scotland) is a mistranslation of "Scott Russel", significantly changing the subject. "der" instead of "der die CBC Sendung moderierte" does not capture the full meaning of "who was hosting CBC's broadcast." The word "Sendung" (broadcast) is incorrect for "Ausstrahlung" (broadcasting live) in this context. "in der Luft" (in the air) is a mistranslation of "live," which changes the delivery method of the apology.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "unglückliche Wortwahl" maintains the meaning of "unfortunate choice of words" adequately and "wir bedauern" is a valid expression of feeling sorry. Both parts of the candidate translation sufficiently match the reference translation, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, since the meaning conveyed remains faithful to the source sentence.
Zettel → Twitter → Twitter		**Explanation:** In this context, "Zettel" (note) is a mistranslation of "tweeted". While "tweet" is used in English to refer to messages sent on the social media platform Twitter, the correct translation would retain a reference to "Twitter" in some form. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Zettel" does not convey the meaning of a social media message.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The word "Kommentatorenkollege" is optional and doesn't change the primary meaning of "Fellow commentator." The rest of the translation faithfully follows the source sentence meaning.
twitter → Titlernutzer → Twitter-User  		**Explanation:** "Titlernutzer" is a mistranslation of "Twitter users". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it misrepresents the platform involved. The correct term should clearly refer to Twitter, maintaining the intended meaning of the social media platform.
network → Netz → Netzwerk  	statement → Erklärung → Mitteilung  		**Explanation:** "Netz" (net) is a mistranslation of "network" and does not convey the same meaning in the context of the sentence. The reference translation uses "Netzwerk," which is the correct contextual term. Additionally, "Erklärung" (explanation) is a mistranslation of "statement," which, in this context, should be "Mitteilung" (statement).
statements → Erklärungen → Aussagen  	air → Luft → ausgestrahlt  		**Explanation:** "Erklärungen" (declarations or explanations) is a mistranslation of "statements", which is more accurately "Aussagen" in this context. The use of "Luft" (air) instead of "ausgestrahlt" (broadcast) changes the meaning significantly, as "air" in this context means to be broadcast rather than literal air, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
1. on-air → in der Luft → auf Sendung	2. followers → Anhänger → Followern	3. Social media → Sozialmedien → sozialen Medien		**Explanation:**	- "in der Luft" (in the air) is a mistranslation of "on-air" in the context of broadcasting, where "auf Sendung" is more appropriate.	- "Anhängern" (followers) potentially could be used for "followers" in some contexts but is less typical for social media contexts, where "Followern" is the standard term.	- "Sozialmedien" (Social media) is technically a translation but "sozialen Medien" is the more natural and correct form in German.
Byron → Byrne → Byrons  	swimmer → Schwimmers → Schwimmerin  		**Explanation:** "Byrne" is a mistranslation of "Byron", which potentially changes the identity of the person referred to, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. The word "Schwimmers" (swimmer) is interpreted as male, while "Schwimmerin" (female swimmer) correctly reflects the gender context as specified in the reference translation.
Byron → ihm → das		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation, "ihm" (to him) is used incorrectly when referring to Byron's regret. The reference translation uses "das" (that), correctly relating to what Byron said, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The differences between "über die Luft" (on-air) and "in der Sendung" (in the broadcast) do not significantly change the overall meaning of the sentence as both imply a broadcast setting, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Similarly, "relativieren" (to relativize) and "rechtfertigen" (to justify) both approximate the meaning of "qualify," capturing the sense of clarification or adjustment, and thus, they do not indicate a significant change in meaning. Therefore, no translation errors are reported.
1. relay → Stellvertreter → Staffel		**Explanation:** "Stellvertreter" (deputy/representative) is a mistranslation of "relay," which refers to a type of race, particularly in an Olympic context here. The correct translation should be "Staffel," which captures the sports event context accurately. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		2. women's → weiblichen → Frauen		**Explanation:** "weiblichen" (female) is technically a valid translation for "women's" but in this context, "Frauen" (women) is more appropriate and specific, especially when referring to specific events like "Frauenschwimmstaffel" (women's swimming relay). This addresses the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule for using the precise noun form in sports contexts.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. The use of "eines Schwimmers" (a swimmer) in place of "der Schwimmerin" (the swimmer, feminine) is acceptable and does not significantly alter the meaning, as both can refer to a swimmer in a general sense. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, allowing different wordings when the overall meaning is not changed.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** 	Both "Selbstverständlich" and "Natürlich" convey the meaning of "Needless to say" adequately in this context. There are no single-word translation errors that significantly alter the meaning of the sentence.
outraged → empört gegen → empört über  	shop → Landes → Geschäft  	brazenly → brutal → schamlos  	underwear → Unterhofe → Unterwäsche  		**Explanation:** 	- "empört gegen" (outraged against) in the candidate translation does not correctly convey the intended meaning of "outraged at" which should be "empört über". This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where the preposition is key to the right context.	- "Landes" (country) is a mistranslation of "shop", which should be "Geschäft". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "brutal" (brutally) is an inaccurate translation of "brazenly", which should be "schamlos", following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Unterhofe" is a non-existent word in German and a mistranslation of "underwear", which should be "Unterwäsche". This is a clear violation of the **Identify Mistranslations** rule.
shoppers → Geschäfter → Käufer  	stripped off → abgeriegelt → auszog  	knickers → Knickern → Unterhosen  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Geschäfter" (shops) is a mistranslation of "shoppers" which refers to the people, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	2. "abgeriegelt" (sealed off) is a mistranslation of "stripped off" as it completely changes the action, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	3. "Knickern" (knickers) is used in a confusing manner here, implying location as opposed to trying on clothing, which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. The intended meaning is "Unterhosen" (underpants).
sized up → ausgebaut → musterte  	looked → hingesehen → aussah  	peeled → abgeschwächt → zog aus  	shelf → Regale → Regal  		**Explanation:** "ausgebaut" (expanded) is a mistranslation of "sized up" as it does not convey the meaning of evaluating or considering appearance. "hingesehen" (looked) is incorrectly used instead of "aussah" (looked/appeared) which better fits the context of evaluating appearance. "abgeschwächt" (weakened) is a mistranslation of "peeled" as it does not fit the context of removing clothing. Finally, "Regale" (shelves) is plural but should have been "Regal" (shelf) in singular to match the context.
browsing → braunte → stöberte	store → Lager → Geschäft
Bouverie → Bouverie → Bouverie  	store → Lager → Geschäft  	knickers → Knackern → Unterhosen  		**Explanation:** "Lager" (warehouse/storage) is a mistranslation of "store", which is better translated as "Geschäft" in this context. "Knackern" does not correspond to any appropriate German translation for "knickers", which should be "Unterhosen". The word "Bouverie" is correctly translated and does not represent an issue.
1. mystery → Gehirnwäsche → mysteriöse  	2. underwear → Gehirnwäsche → Unterwäsche  	3. dressed → gekleidet → anzog  	4. shop → Lager → Geschäft  		**Explanation:**		1. "Gehirnwäsche" (brainwashing) is a mistranslation of "mystery". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it does not fit with "woman", creating a nonsensical phrase.	   	2. "Gehirnwäsche" (brainwashing) is also incorrectly used in place of "underwear", creating an illogical sentence and violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	   	3. "gekleidet" (dressed) could be correct in certain contexts, but based on the reference and common usage, "anzog" (put on) is more appropriate, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	   	4. "Lager" (warehouse/storage) is a mistranslation of "shop" or "store", which significantly changes the meaning and violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
couldn't → können nicht → konnten nicht  	seeing → sehen → sahen  		**Explanation:** "können nicht" (can not) is a mistranslation of "couldn't" (could not), as the candidate uses present tense rather than past. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it changes the time frame indicated by the source. Similarly, "sehen" (see) is a mistranslation of "seeing", which should be in the past tense "sahen". Both errors significantly impact the intended meaning of the sentence concerning the timeframe of the action.
knickers → Knackerpflaster → Unterhosen  	display → Schildkröte → Auslage  	tights → Höhen → Strumpfhosen  	pants → Pflanzen → Hosen  	put → stellte → probierte  		**Explanation:**  	- "Knackerpflaster" (crack patch) is a mistranslation of "knickers", which should be "Unterhosen". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it is contextually incorrect.	- "Schildkröte" (turtle) is a mistranslation of "display", which should be "Auslage". This errors significantly changes the content description.	- "Höhen" (heights) is a mistranslation of "tights", which should be "Strumpfhosen". This changes the meaning significantly in the context of clothing.	- "Pflanzen" (plants) is a mistranslation of "pants", which should be "Hosen". This is another change affecting the intended meaning in a significant way.	- "stellte" (placed) is a mistranslation of "put", which in context should be "probierte" (tried on) as it relates to wearing clothes. This alters the action described in the scene.
didn't → hat nicht → versuchte nicht  	discreet → Ermessensspielraum → diskreteren  	bold → Brust → frech  		**Explanation:** 	1. "hat nicht" (did not) does not fully capture the negation implied by "didn't try" compared to "versuchte nicht" (did not try). This adheres to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes the intent of the attempt.	2. "Ermessensspielraum" (discretion) is not a valid translation for "discreet" in this context and should be "diskreteren" (more discreet).	3. "Brust" (breast) is an incorrect translation of "bold", where "frech" (bold or cheeky) fits the context of the idiom used. This adheres to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, focusing on the word that changes the sentence meaning significantly.
staring → startete → starrte  	she → er → sie  	knickers → Hacker → Unterhosen  	shelf → Regal → ins Regal  		**Explanation:**  	- "startete" (started) is a mistranslation of "staring" and significantly alters the meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "er" (he) is a mistranslation of "she." Gender errors are significant according to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Hacker" (hackers) is a mistranslation of "knickers," violating **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** by completely changing the item being discussed.	- "Regal" (shelf) as a standalone word lacks the necessary preposition "ins" (into the), making it a mistranslation of "on the shelf".
three → Papieren → Unterhosen  	dressed → gekleidet → anzog  		**Explanation:** "Papieren" (papers) is a mistranslation of "pairs" which should be "Unterhosen" (underpants), significantly affecting the subject of the actions. "gekleidet" (dressed) is incorrectly translated as using a passive form which alters the intended meaning of "she got dressed"; instead, "anzog" (dressed herself) should have been used, maintaining both reflexive action and consistency with the provided reference.
knickers → Messer → Unterhosen  		**Explanation:** The German word "Messer" translates to "knives" in English, which significantly differs from "knickers", the correct translation of which is "Unterhosen". This error changes the meaning of what was being tried on and subsequently impacts the narrative of the sentence.
Kent town → Stadt Kent → Kent  	disgusting → empörend → widerlich  	go → Menschen → mit  	take → Hausknicker → Unterhosen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Kent town" is mistranslated as "Stadt Kent". In the source context, "Kent town" identifies Kent as the general location, not specifying a particular town within Kent. The correct translation should just be "Kent".	- "disgusting" is mistranslated as "empörend" (outrageous), which does not carry the same meaning as "widerlich" (disgusting).	- "go" in "going to take" is mistranslated as "Menschen" (people), which is a non-sequitur in this context. The grammatical structure indicates that "go" should be part of the phrase expressing intent or imminence (in this case, it should align with "mit" or "nach Hause nehmen" in German).	- "take" is mistranslated as "Hausknicker" (nonsensical term), whereas the correct translation should be "Unterhosen" (underwear).
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The difference between "Nachmittag" and "nachmittag" is a matter of capitalization and style rather than a translation error. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as the meaning remains unchanged.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The differences between the candidate and the reference translations, such as "Personal" for "Mitarbeiter" and "Kleidung" for "Kleidungsstücke," do not significantly alter the meaning or violate the guidelines. Therefore, they are considered acceptable variations.
I'd → hatte Hass → würde es hassen  	pair → Knackerpaar → Paar  	knickers → Knackerpaar → Unterhosen  	home → nach Hause zu kommen → nach Hause zu gehen  		**Explanation:** "hatte Hass" is a mistranslation of "I'd hate," where "würde es hassen" more accurately captures the conditional sense of the phrase, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "Knackerpaar" is a mistranslation for "pair of knickers"; "Paar" is acceptable for "pair," but "Knackerpaar" is incorrect for "Unterhosen" (knickers). Also, "nach Hause zu kommen" is acceptable but considering the idiomatic preference, "nach Hause zu gehen" might better fit the context.
spokesman → Sprecher → Sprecher von  	store → Lager → Filiale  		**Explanation:** "Sprecher" is generally correct, but "Sprecher von" is often a more natural way to indicate someone speaking on behalf of a company, reflecting the **Contextual Accuracy** as seen in the reference translation. "Lager" (warehouse) is a mistranslation of "store" in this context; "Filiale" (branch/store) is the correct term.
all → gesamte → Alle  	product → Produkt → Produkte  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "gesamte" (entire) for "all," which changes the intended sense of plural completeness meant by "Alle." The candidate word "Produkt" (product) is singular, while the reference uses "Produkte," indicating a plural form that matches the context of the source sentence. These errors violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as they impact the understanding of the plurality in the original sentence.
gun → Waffen → Waffenangriffe  	defend → verteidigen → schützt  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Waffen" (weapons) is a mistranslation of "gun attacks". The reference uses "Waffenangriffe" to specifically refer to attacks involving guns.	2. "verteidigen" (defend) has a slightly different nuance compared to "schützt" (protect), and "schützt" aligns more closely with contextually appropriate action suggested by Krav Maga training in the reference. This is a meaningful error given the context of self-defense techniques.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence accurately. The differences observed are acceptable variations and do not significantly change the meaning of the sentence.
(We spoke → Wir haben gesprochen → Wir sprachen)	(grandmaster → Großmaster → Großmeister)	(Krav Maga Federation → Kraw-Maga-Föderation → Krav Maga Verband)	(gun-toting muggers → Schlägern → bewaffneten Räubern)		**Explanation:**		1. "We spoke" is translated as "Wir haben gesprochen," but in the reference, it's "Wir sprachen." This is a tense mismatch but retains meaning.	2. "grandmaster" is translated as "Großmaster," but the correct German term is "Großmeister." This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** by using an inappropriate Germanization of "master."	3. "Krav Maga Federation" is translated as "Kraw-Maga-Föderation." The reference uses "Krav Maga Verband," which is the standard translation. "Kraw" is a typographical error and violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	4. "gun-toting muggers" is translated as "Schlägern," which means "thugs." The intended meaning referring to armed individuals is lost, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
approached → mit → nähert  	mugger → Tisch → Räuber  		**Explanation:** "mit" (with) is a mistranslation of "approached", which does not make sense in this context, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Additionally, "Tisch" (table) is a mistranslation of "mugger", significantly altering the meaning of the action in the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as well.
(approached → hereinkommt → annähert)  	(Mizrachi → Miraschi → Mizrachi)  	(clear → die Linie des Feuers → sich aus der Schusslinie begeben)  		**Explanation:** "hereinkommt" (comes in) is a mistranslation for "approached", which should be "annähert" to match the action described. "Miraschi" is a clear typographical error of the proper noun "Mizrachi". "die Linie des Feuers" (the line of fire) doesn't capture the phrase "clear the line of fire", which should be translated as "sich aus der Schusslinie begeben" (get out of the line of fire) to convey the correct action.
1. grasp → verstehen → ergreifen  	2. forearm → Arm → Vorderarm  	3. face → Freibrief → Gesicht  		**Explanation:** 	- "verstehen" (understand) is a mistranslation of "grasp" because "verstehen" does not convey the physical action of seizing or holding, which is critical in the context.	- "Arm" (arm) is too general for "forearm," not specifying the part intended here, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Freibrief" (letter of free passage or carte blanche) is an obvious mistranslation of "face," as it fails to maintain the basic meaning of the sentence.
knee → Knie → Leiste  	groin → Getreide → Leiste  	doubles → verdoppelt → zusammenkrümmt  	twist → verdoppelt → verdrehen  	barrel → Barrel → Lauf  	back → hinter → rückwärts	keep → hält → richten	trained → ausgebildet → richten		**Explanation:** 		1. "Knie" (knee) is translated literally as "Knie", which is correct, but in the context "Eine Knie zum Getreide" (A knee to the grain) is incorrect. The correct context here is "knee to the groin", which aligns with the use of "Leiste" (groin or crotch) in the reference.	   	2. "Getreide" (grain) is a mistranslation of "groin", where it should be "Leiste", changing the context significantly.		3. "verdoppelt" is used for "doubles", which could directly translate but contextually the action is wrong; "zusammenkrümmt" (doubles up) captures the pain reaction contextually correct.		4. "verdoppelt" used for "twist" is incorrect; it should be "verdrehen" to maintain the action of twisting the gun out of the attacker's hands.		5. "Barrel" should be translated as "Lauf", maintaining a complete and correct representation for "barrel of a gun".		6. "hinter" means "behind" or "back" in terms of location, but in this sentence structure it fails to convey the action of moving backward; "rückwärts" (backwards) is more contextually appropriate.		7. "hält" (holds/keeps) implies maintenance but lacks the connotation of aiming, where "richten" (to aim) is appropriate.		8. "ausgebildet" means "trained" as in learned; however, in context, "train" implies "aim" in the sense of keeping a weapon pointed, which aligns with "richten".
gunmen → Feuerwehrleute → Angreifern  	line → Feuer → Schusslinie  	twist → vertuschen → verdrehen  	villain → Böse → Angreifer  		**Explanation:**		1. "Feuerwehrleute" (firefighters) is a mistranslation of "gunmen", as it incorrectly identifies the individuals approaching.	   	2. "Feuer" (fire) is not equivalent to "line" in this context. The phrase should refer to "Schusslinie" (line of fire), not physically being in a 'fire'.		3. "vertuschen" (cover up or hide) is not a suitable substitution for "twist", which should have been translated to "verdrehen" in the context of manipulating an object's orientation.		4. "Böse" (evil one or bad person) isn't specific enough in this context compared to "Angreifer" (attacker), which maintains the direct relationship to a person trying to shoot.
weight → Vordergrund → Gewicht  	punch → Schublade → Brust  	chest → Schublade → Brust  	twist → unterstützen → verdrehen  	gun → anzeigen → Waffe  	backing → unterstützen → rückwärts  	pointing → anzeigen → richten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Vordergrund" (foreground) is a mistranslation of "weight," significantly altering the intended action.	2. "Schublade" (drawer) is mistranslated from both "punch" and "chest," which are incorrectly combined. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, so each distinct mistranslation is noted.	3. "unterstützen" (support) instead of "twist" changes the action of twisting the gun.	4. "anzeigen" (display/report) instead of "gun" does not fit the context.	5. "unterstützen" also mistranslates "backing up," changing the intended action.	6. "anzeigen" again incorrectly translates "pointing," altering the direction of action.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In this context, "kompliziert" (complicated) and "schwierig" (tricky/difficult) are near-synonyms and convey similar meanings, which aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Thus, no meaningful single-word translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essence of the source sentence adequately, and the differences between "Kontrollieren Sie" (check) and "Sehen Sie sich an" (look at) do not significantly alter the meaning in this context. Additionally, "macht" (does) is a valid simpler form of "vormacht" (demonstrates), so these variations do not constitute meaningful translation errors according to the guidelines.
mugging → Schmuggel → Raub  		**Explanation:** "Schmuggel" (smuggling) is a mistranslation of "mugging", which is significantly different in meaning and context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because smuggling involves illegal trading rather than a personal physical robbery.
traveller → Reisender → Reisender  	scrapes → schrottet → schabt   	tongue → Sprache → Zunge  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Reisender" is a correct translation for "traveller" and matches the reference.	2. "schrottet" (wrecks) is a mistranslation of "scrapes." The correct translation should be closer to "schabt" (scrapes), significantly altering the intended action described.	3. "Sprache" (language) is a mistranslation of "tongue." In this context, "Zunge" is the correct translation, as "tongue" refers to the body part, not language. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
gag → Glücks → Würge  	licking → geknebelt → ableckte  		**Explanation:** "Glücksreflex" (luck reflex) is a mistranslation of "gag reflex", which alters the intended meaning. "Geknebelt" (gagged) is a mistranslation of "licking", significantly changing the action described in the source sentence.
presenter → Reisebriefer → Moderator  	travel writer → Reisebriefer → Reiseautor  	scraped → schrottete → schabte  	tongue → Sprache → Zuge  	note → Note → Schein  	hand rail → Handschiene → Geländer  	flush button → Toilettenknote → Spülknopf  		**Explanation:**  	- "Reisebriefer" is an incorrect translation for both "presenter" and "travel writer", which should be "Moderator" and "Reiseautor", respectively.	- "schrottete" (scrapped/scrapped to pieces) is a mistranslation of "scraped", which should be "schabte".	- "Sprache" (language) is a mistranslation of "tongue", which should be "Zuge".	- "Note" (musical note) is a mistranslation of "note" in the context of money, which should be "Schein".	- "Handschiene" (hand splint) is a mistranslation of "hand rail", which should be "Geländer".	- "Toilettenknote" is not an accurate translation for "flush button", which should be "Spülknopf".
licking → durchzog → Ablecken  	Luminometer → Luminemeter → Luminometer  	was → worauf → auf was    	hinging → hinging → einlassen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "durchzog" (passed through) is a mistranslation of "licking" which changes the intended action and meaning of the sentence. According to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, "durchzog" should be identified as a key error.	2. "Luminemeter" is a typo or mistranslation of "Luminometer," which needs to be accurately represented for clarity and aligns with **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.	3. "worauf" (what on) does not accurately capture "what" in the context, as indicated by the reference "auf was," pointing to "worauf" as a semantic inaccuracy.	4. "hinging" is conceptually different from "einlassen" (engage), as the reference indicates a more involved commitment, which means the candidate translation has an incomplete or imprecise interpretation of the situation according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the meaning of the source sentence effectively. Although there are slight differences in phrasing compared to the reference, such as "hervorgebracht" instead of "ans Tageslicht gebracht", these do not significantly alter the meaning of "threw up surprising results". Additionally, "Doch" and "Aber" are both acceptable translations of "But". Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, no significant single-word errors are detected.
thought → Zugknopf → Gedanke  	licking → kleben → abzulecken  	flush button → Zugknopf → Spülknopf einer Zugtoilette  	repellent → widersinnig → abstoßend  	kitchen sink → Küchensenke → Küchenspüle  		**Explanation:** "Zugknopf" (train button) seems to be the translation for "thought", which is incorrect as it should be "Gedanke". "Kleben" (to stick) is a mistranslation of "licking", which changes the intended action. "Zugknopf" (train button) should be "Spülknopf einer Zugtoilette" (flush button of a train toilet) to accurately reflect the context of the source. "Widersinnig" (nonsensical) does not convey the disgust implied by "repellent", which should be "abstoßend". "Küchensenke" (kitchen decline) is incorrect for "kitchen sink", which should be "Küchenspüle".
bacteria → Bakterien → Darmbakterien  		**Explanation:** The candidate word "Bakterien" (bacteria) is a partial translation of the term "gut bacteria". The reference specifies "Darmbakterien" (gut bacteria), which is important because it specifies the type of bacteria relevant to the context, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
he → ihm → er  	licked → hinterließ → ableckte  		**Explanation:** The word "ihm" in the candidate refers to the wrong subject. The source "he" should translate to "er," maintaining the subject-pronoun correspondence. Moreover, "licked" is incorrectly translated as "hinterließ" (left); the correct translation should be "ableckte," which retains the action of licking.
durability → Dauerhaftigkeit → Widerstandsfähigkeit  	gut → Dachs → Darms  	weird → weiße → eigenartige  		**Explanation:**  	- "Dauerhaftigkeit" (permanence) is a mistranslation of "durability", which should be "Widerstandsfähigkeit" (resilience). This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as the term incorrectly characterizes the nature of the testing.	- "Dachs" (roof) is a mistranslation of "gut", which should be "Darms" (intestine). This is an **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** violation, as it's anatomically incorrect in context.	- "weiße" (white) is a mistranslation of "weird", which should be "eigenartige" (strange or peculiar), affecting the meaning of what was consumed, as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
public → Händen → Geländern  	handrails → Händen → Geländern  	flush button → Toilettenpulver → Spülknöpfen  
kid → Köder → Kind  	carefree → ungesühnt → unbesorgt  	soil → Boden → Erde  	worms → Wärme → Würmer  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Köder" (bait) is a mistranslation of "kid", significantly altering the intended meaning about the speaker's childhood experiences. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Ungesühnt" (unatoned) is a mistranslation of "carefree", affecting the speaker's attitude toward health. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	3. "Boden" (ground) is not entirely incorrect for "soil", but "Erde" is more accurate in this context. This adheres to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	4. "Wärme" (warmth) is a mistranslation of "worms", which changes the meaning of what the speaker put in their mouth. This is a clear violation of the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essence of the source sentence well. The key elements such as "certainly" (sicherlich), "proved his reputation" (seinen Ruf unter Beweis gestellt), and "during the film" (im Film) are appropriately translated, aligning with the intended meaning without introducing significant translation errors. The differences in phrasing between the candidate and reference translation do not lead to any meaningful change in meaning, complying with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
turned down → distanziert → ablehnte  	Russian → russischen → in Russland  		**Explanation:** "distanziert" (distanced) is a mistranslation of "turned down", which changes the meaning from declining an offer to creating distance. Following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, this alteration significantly impacts the sentence's interpretation. Additionally, "russischen" (Russian) implies a different ownership or origin than "in Russland" (in Russia). The reference specifies a location rather than a characteristic of the toilet, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
sample swab → Stichprobenspaltung → Probeabstrich  	luminometer → Luminemateur → Luminometer  		**Explanation:** "Stichprobenspaltung" (sample division) is a mistranslation of "sample swab", significantly changing the meaning. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it inaccurately describes a scientific procedure. "Luminemateur" is not a correct translation for "luminometer". It alters the intended scientific context and violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although the reference provides additional context with "Luminometerzahl" (luminometer reading), the candidate captures the main point regarding the measurement being less than 60. The primary elements "Vergleich" (comparison), "frisch gewaschene Hände" (freshly washed hands), and "unter 60 kommen" (come in under 60) align well with the source meaning. Given that the essential comparison and numerical aspect are preserved, no significant single-word errors are present.
Russian → in Russland → russische  	lick → zu klinken → abzulecken  	count → Luminerzählung → Luminometerzahl  	washed → waschende → gewaschene  		**Explanation:**	- "in Russland" (in Russia) incorrectly adds a location emphasis that isn't present in the source. The correct translation for "Russian" in this context is "russische."	- "zu klinken" (to clink) is a significant mistranslation of "lick", which should be "abzulecken" in this context. This changes the intended meaning of the action.	- "Luminerzählung" (Lumi-count) fails to convey the meaning of "luminometer count", which is more accurately translated as "Luminometerzahl."	- "waschende" (washing) lacks the completion implied by "washed" and changes the meaning. Correct translation is "gewaschene".
traveller's → Reiser → Reisefilm  	bacteria count → Bakterien → Bakterienzahl  	different → anderen → verschiedenen  	place → Ort → Orten  		**Explanation:**  	- "Reiser" is a mistranslation of "traveller's", which should have been "Reisefilm" for the specific context of a "traveller's film".	- "Bakterien" (bacteria) does not convey the same meaning as "Bakterienzahl" (bacteria count), which is more accurate in this context.	- "anderen" (other) is a mistranslation of "different", which should be "verschiedenen" for the context of "different places".	- "Ort" (place) does not correctly imply the plural "Orten" that the reference uses to indicate multiple places.
worst → schlechtesten → Schlimmsten  	smelled → geschriegen → gerochen  		**Explanation:** 	- "schlechtesten" (worst) is used in a superlative sense incorrectly as the reference uses "Schlimmsten" (comes close to the worst). The mistranslation is significant as it alters the degree of evaluation.	- "geschriegen" (screamed) is a mistranslation of "smelled" which significantly changes the meaning of the verb phrase, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. While the structure is slightly different, both use "schmutziger" to express "dirty", which is contextually accurate and retains the intended meaning. There is no single-word mistranslation that significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
lick → vertuschen → anlecken  	disgusting → abscheulich → ekelhaft  		**Explanation:** "vertuschen" (cover up) is a mistranslation of "lick", which alters the action being described. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by changing the action from licking to covering up, which is contextually incorrect. "abscheulich" (abhorrent) differs from "ekelhaft" (disgusting), but this is more a stylistic choice; however, given the context, "ekelhaft" fits better meaning-wise.
Lickhiker's → Lichker → Lickhiker's  	Strength → Strenge → Strength  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation has "Lichker" which seems to be a typographical error for "Lickhiker's". This violates the **Identify Mistranslations** rule. The source and reference sentences include "Strength", which has been incorrectly translated as "Strenge" (severity/strictness), not capturing the intended meaning of "Inner Strength". Thus, it violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
lactic → lackistische → Milchsäure  	people's → Stiefmütterbakterien → Darmbakterien  		**Explanation:** "lackistische" (a non-existent or incorrect form in German) is a mistranslation of "lactic" which should be "Milchsäure" (lactic). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it significantly changes the intended meaning related to probiotics. "Stiefmütterbakterien" (stepmother bacteria, which is nonsensical in this context) is a mistranslation of "people's gut bacteria" which should refer to "Darmbakterien" (gut bacteria). This error violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by confusing the context and intended meaning.
Senior Vice President → Vizepräsident → Senior Vice President  	Juice → Justiz → Säfte  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Vizepräsident" is a mistranslation of "Senior Vice President". The candidate uses "Vizepräsident" (vice president), which implies a different level of seniority compared to "Senior Vice President". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it misrepresents Niko Vuorenmaa's position.		2. "Justiz" (justice) is a mistranslation of "Juice". This significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, related to the type of products Valio is involved with, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
probiotics → Antibiotika → Probiotika  		**Explanation:** "Antibiotika" (antibiotics) is a mistranslation of "probiotics". This significantly alters the meaning because antibiotics and probiotics are distinct concepts, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
brainstorming → Gehirnstürmung → Brainstormings  	call → nennen → anrufen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Gehirnstürmung" is an incorrect and nonstandard translation for "brainstorming", violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Brainstormings" is the standard loanword used in German.	- "nennen" means "to name" instead of "to call (on the phone)", which changes the intended action. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it significantly alters the sentence's meaning. The correct translation should be "anrufen".
interest → Interesse → Interesse  	gut health → Gärtengesundheit → Darmgesundheit  		**Explanation:** "Gärtengesundheit" (garden health) is a mistranslation of "gut health". This error significantly changes the meaning of the sentence from a biological context to a horticultural one. The German word "Interesse" matches in both candidate and reference translations, so it is correctly translated. The correct translation should focus on the gut (Darm) rather than a garden (Garten), adhering to the **Contextual Accuracy** rule.
gut → Gummigesundheit → Darmgesundheit  		**Explanation:** "Gummigesundheit" (gum health) is a mistranslation of "gut health," which significantly alters the intended meaning. "Darmgesundheit" (gut health) in the reference translation keeps the original context intact. This correction adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
interest → Interesse → Interesse    	gut → Gärtengesundheit → Darmgesundheit  	consumers → Verbraucher → Konsumenten  	interesting → interessanter → interessante  		**Explanation:**  	1. **gut → Gärtengesundheit → Darmgesundheit:** "Gärtengesundheit" (garden health) is a mistranslation of "gut health", which refers to digestive health. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "garden health" changes the intended meaning.	2. **consumers → Verbraucher → Konsumenten:** Although "Verbraucher" and "Konsumenten" can both mean "consumers", if we consider the context, "Konsumenten" aligns precisely with the reference translation. Therefore, based on the prioritization of ensuring contextual accuracy, it's worth noting the preference in the reference.	3. **interesting → interessanter → interessante:** The candidate word "interessanter" changes the intended meaning to "more interesting", while the reference indicates "interesting". This is a meaningful deviation because it alters the tone or intent implied in providing information.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence "Ich glaube auch, der Film zeigt, dass wir viel Sinn für Humor haben!" preserves the overall meaning and sentiment of the source sentence. "Glaube" and "denke" are acceptable variations for "think," and "viel" is a reasonable interpretation of "great" in this context, as it conveys a similar meaning quality. Therefore, no errors that significantly change the meaning are identified, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
directed → anführte → die Regie des Films führte  	would have lost → hätte verloren → hätte meinen Respekt verloren  	licked → geliehen → geleckt  	disgusting → empörende → ekelhafte  		**Explanation:** "anführte" (led) does not convey the meaning of "directed" in the context of film direction, where "die Regie des Films führte" is specific. "hätte verloren" misses the specific context of "would have lost respect" which is adequately translated as "hätte meinen Respekt verloren". "geliehen" (borrowed) is a mistranslation of "licked" (geleckt), as the actions are very different. "empörende" (outrageous) is a mistranslation of "disgusting" (ekelhafte), which changes the context of the scene being described.
some → es → Dinge  	to get → in die Knie zu zwingen → dazu zu bringen, sie anzulecken  	Ian → den Iran → Ian  		**Explanation:**  	1. "es" (it) in "war es einfacher" (it was easier) doesn't capture the plural sense implied by "some things". "Dinge" (things) is the correct translation, aligning with the source sentence.	2. "in die Knie zu zwingen" (to force to kneel) is a mistranslation of "to get [Ian] to lick". This dramatically changes the meaning, so the relevant word is reduced to "to get" which should be "dazu zu bringen, sie anzulecken" (to get [Ian] to lick).	3. "den Iran" is entirely incorrect, as it replaces "Ian" with "Iran", fundamentally altering the subject of the sentence. The correct translation should maintain the name "Ian".
dirty → Lacken → schmutzigen  	caught → geraten → aufgenommen  		**Explanation:**  	1. **dirty → Lacken → schmutzigen:** "Lacken" translates to "puddles" in English, which does not match the context of "dirty licks" meant in terms of music or unfavorable moments. The correct word respecting context is "schmutzigen."  	2. **caught → geraten → aufgenommen:** "geraten" translates to "fallen" or "ended up," which does not correctly convey the action of "catching" something on tape. The correct term is "aufgenommen," meaning "recorded" or "captured." These errors significantly alter the intended meaning of the original sentence, thereby violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
lactic acid bacteria → Lacksäure → Milchsäurebakterien  	stomach → Magen- → Magen  	gut → Stachels → Darm  	added → zusätzliche → beigefügte  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Lacksäure" is a mistranslation of "lactic acid bacteria", which should be "Milchsäurebakterien", significantly changing the meaning related to the type of bacteria.	2. "Magen-" (part of "Magen- und Stachels") is incorrect in this context for "stomach", as it should stand alone as "Magen".	3. "Stachels" is a mistranslation of "gut" and does not convey the correct organ, which should be "Darm".	4. Although "zusätzliche" in the phrase "zusätzliche Säuren" might seem correct for "added", it changes the contextual meaning compared to "beigefügte", which is the correct term in this context.
family → Vor → Asoziale Familie  	yobs → Vor → Asoziale  	eviction → Vertreibung → Delogierung  		**Explanation:** 	- "Vor" (before) is used in the candidate instead of "asoziale Familie" (antisocial family/yobs), which appears twice due to separation in the reference, indicating a mistake in representing "yobs" and "family."	- "Vertreibung" (expulsion) is a general term and doesn't capture the specific context of eviction, whereas "Delogierung" (eviction) is the correct term.
yobs → Beschäftigten → asoziale  	council house → Ratshaus → Sozialwohnung  		**Explanation:** "Beschäftigten" (employees) does not convey the same meaning as "yobs" or "asoziale", which implies a derogatory term for antisocial or hooligan-like behavior. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "employees" does not fit the derogatory context. "Ratshaus" (town hall) is an incorrect translation of "council house", changing the meaning of the type of housing described. These adhere to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule since both words significantly alter the intended meaning of the sentence.
property → Eigentum → Anwesen		**Explanation:** "Eigentum" (property) is a more general term than "Anwesen" (estate, premises), which is contextually more accurate given the scenario. The significant change in meaning due to this mismatch violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
property → Besitz → Anwesen  	officers → Wohnungsbehörden → Angestellte  	shocked → (missing) → schockierte  	state of disrepair → Zustand der Reparatur → irreparablen Zustand  		**Explanation:** "Besitz" (possession) is a mistranslation of "property" in this context, where "Anwesen" (estate) would be more appropriate. "Wohnungsbehörden" (housing authorities) is a mistranslation of "housing association officers"; the correct translation should be "Angestellte" (employees/officers). The adjective "shocked" is entirely missing in the candidate translation, altering the emphasis and sentiment about the officers' reaction. "Zustand der Reparatur" (state of repair) is the opposite of "state of disrepair," significantly changing the meaning. The target should be something similar to "irreparablen Zustand" (irreparable condition).
walls → Mauern → Wände  	floorboards → Fußboden → Holzdielen  	ripped up → gefüllt → aufgerissen  	strewn → gepflastert → verstreut  	daubed → begraben → geschmiert  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Mauern" (walls) is technically correct, but in the reference, "Wände" is used. This is a less significant error but affects the translation when combined with other issues.  	2. "Fußboden" (floor) is a mistranslation for "floorboards", which refers to "Holzdielen".  	3. "Gefüllt" (filled) is a mistranslation of "ripped up", which should be "aufgerissen". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.  	4. "Gepflastert" (paved) is a mistranslation of "strewn", which should be "verstreut".  	5. "Begraben" (buried) is a mistranslation of "daubed", which should be "geschmiert".
moved → getrieben → umgesiedelt  	accomodation → Wohnung → Unterkunft  		**Explanation:** "getrieben" (driven) is a mistranslation of "moved", which changes the nature of the relocation in the sentence. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it suggests a different cause for the move. "Wohnung" (apartment) is a mistranslation of "accommodation", which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it specifies a type of accommodation rather than the general term.
Cornwall Housing → Cornwall House → Cornwall Housing  	housing → Wohnungsleiterin → Hausverwaltung  	beyond saving → nicht zu retten → nicht mehr zu reparieren  		**Explanation:** "Cornwall Housing" was mistranslated as "Cornwall House". "Wohnungsleiterin" (housing manager) is a mistranslation of "Hausverwaltung" (housing authority/administration), which doesn't accurately convey the source meaning. "nicht zu retten" (not to save) doesn't fully capture "beyond saving" in the way "nicht mehr zu reparieren" (beyond repair) does. These are significant errors, and thus, they violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences, with no significant mistranslations at the word level. Variations in expression, such as "glaube nicht" (don't think) and "bin der Ansicht" (am of the opinion), do not alter the meaning significantly. Therefore, this follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, resulting in no reported errors.
property → Eigentum → Anwesen  	element → Element → Teil  		**Explanation:** "Eigentum" (property) is technically a valid translation, but "Anwesen" (estate) often fits better in the given context of property ownership within larger contexts like Cornwall, focusing on the intended meaning rather than the literal translation. "Element" (element) was mistranslated as part of a phrase indicating part or section of a place, where "Teil" (part) retains the intended context of the source sentence.
name → Name → Ruf		**Explanation:** "Name" is a mistranslation of "name" in this context, because the German "Ruf" (reputation) better conveys the intended meaning of "notorious name". This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, identifying the key term in the mistranslation.
couple → Paare → Paar  	sons → Söhne → Söhne (kept because context implies multiple families with "Paare")  	property → Besitztümern → Wohnung  	intermittently → (missing in translation) → zwischenzeitlich  	baseball bats → Baselschlägen → Baseballschlägern (focus on incorrect tool)  	arguing → Argumente → Streiten  	swearing → Verrat → Fluchen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Paare" (couples) is a mistranslation of "couple" which should be singular, "Paar".	- "Söhne" is kept for context as "Paare" implies multiple families; however, it's a contextual error due to "Paare."	- "Besitztümern" (properties) doesn't match the specificity of "property" and context of singular.	- "zwischenzeitlich" (intermittently) is missing in the candidate but present in the reference.	- The tool used should be "Baseballschlägern" not "Baselschlägen."	- "Argumente" (arguments) mistranslates the context intended by "arguing."	- "Verrat" (betrayal) drastically changes the meaning of "swearing," which should be "Fluchen."
name → Name → Name  	tenancy → Zaun → Mietvertrag  	antisocial → unsozialem → antisoziales  		**Explanation:**		1. **"name → Name → Name":** "Name" is correctly translated, thus no error here.		2. **"tenancy → Zaun → Mietvertrag":** "Zaun" (fence) is a clear mistranslation of "tenancy", which should be "Mietvertrag" (lease/tenancy). This significantly changes the meaning and is therefore an error.		3. **"antisocial → unsozialem → antisoziales":** "unsozialem" (unsocial) is not the precise translation and should be "antisoziales" (antisocial). Though close, the technical/legal nuance makes "antisoziales" more accurate and thus "unsozialem" is marked as an error.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essence of the source sentence and aligns well with the reference translation. There are no single-word mismatches that change the sentence's meaning, hence this follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
boards → Vorstände → Holzdielen  	property → Immobilien → Anwesen  	dealt → behandelt → gehandelt  		**Explanation:** "Vorstände" (executive boards) is a mistranslation of "boards", which refers to "Holzdielen" (floorboards) in this context. "Immobilien" (real estate) is a mistranslation of "property", which refers specifically to "Anwesen" (a property or premises here). "behandelt" (treated) is a mistranslation of "dealt", which should be "gehandelt" in the context of dealing drugs. These errors significantly alter the meaning of the original sentence, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
Neighbours → Die Nachbarn → Nachbarn  	say → sagen → sagten aus  	were seen → kämpfen → kämpfen sahen  	called → aufgerufen → angerufen  		**Explanation:**  	1. **"Neighbours":** The candidate translation incorrectly includes "Die" which is not necessary here. Therefore, "Die Nachbarn" should be "Nachbarn", marking an error for "Neighbours".	2. **"say":** The candidate translates "say" as "sagen", while the reference uses "sagten aus", indicating a testimony or statement, which better fits the context.  	3. **"were seen":** The candidate translates "were seen" as "kämpfen", leaving out the essential "gesehen" or "sahen" context, which indicates that the neighbours actually witnessed the event.  	4. **"called":** The candidate translates "called" as "aufgerufen", which means "called upon" and does not accurately convey "angrufen" (called on the phone), the correct term for calling the police.
forcefully → mit Nachdruck → gewaltsam  	property → Eigentum → Anwesen  		**Explanation:** "mit Nachdruck" (emphatically) is a mistranslation of "forcefully", which conveys a stronger, more physical action. This is an example of the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it significantly alters the severity implied in the sentence. "Eigentum" (property) does not match the contextual "Anwesen" (estate), as "property" typically refers to real estate in this context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the specific word choice changes the meaning of what kind of property is referred to.
eviction → Vertreibung → Delogierung  	relieved → befreundeten → erleichterten  	hell → lebendig → Hölle  		**Explanation:** 	- "Vertreibung" (expulsion) is a mistranslation of "eviction", which in this context should be "Delogierung" to specifically refer to removing tenants from property.	- "befreundeten" (friendly) is a mistranslation of "relieved", which should be "erleichterten" to correctly convey the meaning of neighbors feeling relieved.	- "lebendig" (alive) is a mistranslation of "hell", significantly changing the meaning. In this context, "Hölle" accurately depicts the intended meaning of intense suffering or unhappiness.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "kümmern sich" and "scherten sich" can be used to convey a lack of concern, satisfying the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. The meaning of the sentence is preserved, and therefore no significant single-word translation errors exist.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Wir haben 20 Jahre neben ihnen gelebt, und das war immer schlecht" maintains the same meaning as the reference translation "Wir lebten 20 Jahre neben ihnen und es war immer schlimm." The use of "haben ... gelebt" and "lebten" are both appropriate past tense forms for "lived." While "schlecht" and "schlimm" are not exact synonyms, they are contextually close enough not to warrant listing a single-word translation error. Therefore, no significant meaning change occurs, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
times → Häufigkeit → Male  	unbelievable → hoch → unglaublich  		**Explanation:** "Häufigkeit" (frequency) does not match "times," as it changes the focus from the count of occurrences ("Male" or "times") to a more general measure of occurrences ("Häufigkeit" or "frequency"). "hoch" (high) is an unnecessary addition to "unglaublich" (unbelievable) and changes the intended meaning conveyed by "unbelievable".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Heute Morgen konnten wir nicht schlafen" accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although there is a minor stylistic difference in the capitalization of "Morgen" vs. "morgen", this does not significantly change the meaning or context, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, which focuses on errors that significantly impact meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "aufgestanden" instead of "standen auf," which is an acceptable variation of forming the past tense of "get up." Both phrases communicate the same action in this context. Similarly, "daran sind wir nicht gewöhnt!" and "das sind wir nicht gewohnt!" convey the same meaning about not being accustomed to quietness. Hence, there are no significant single-word errors that change the intended meaning, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence. "schön" (lovely) and "verschunden" (gone) are appropriate translations of their respective source words, aligning well with the context provided. The sentence structure differences between the candidate translation and reference translation relate to style and do not constitute a significant change in meaning, in accordance with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
family → Familie → es die Familie  	local authority → lokalen Behörden → lokalen Behörden  		**Explanation:**  	1. **family → Familie → es die Familie**: The candidate sentence's translation of "the family" to "die Familie" is acceptable as it directly translates the phrase accurately. However, the reference translation adds "es," indicating a more nuanced expression which implies "es die Familie verabsäumt hätte," but the focus here is on identifying mistranslation, hence no error on this particular aspect.	   	2. **local authority → lokalen Behörden → lokalen Behörden**: The translation "mit den lokalen Behörden" for "with the local authority" is contextually appropriate. There is no mistranslation present, as the phrase correctly reflects the meaning intended in the source sentence.		**Conclusion:** **No translation errors detected.**		Upon further consideration, based on strict interpretation with the rules guiding contextual accuracy and prioritizing meaningful errors, the candidate sentence accurately reflects the intended meaning, demonstrating correct context, despite some stylistic differences. The phrase components align correctly in both candidate and reference translations; hence no actionable mistranslation can be identified.
lived → lebt → lebte  	property → Eigentum → Haus  		**Explanation:**  	- "lebt" (lives) is a mistranslation of "lived", which is in past tense. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the tense is incorrect in the candidate translation compared to the source and reference.	- "Eigentum" (property) is a less accurate translation of "house" in this context, as the reference uses "Haus". This fits the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule where the significant error affects the context of the setting being referred to as a "house" rather than generic "property".
Rubbish → Müll → Müll  	old toys → altes Spielzeug → alte Spielzeuge  	council house → Ratshaus → Gemeindehaus  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Müll" is the correct translation for "rubbish", matching the reference, so there's no error on this word.	  	2. "altes Spielzeug" is a mistranslation of "old toys", while the reference uses "alte Spielzeuge". Singular "Spielzeug" should be pluralized to match "toys".		3. "Ratshaus" should be "Gemeindehaus". While "Ratshaus" can translate to "council house", the reference uses "Gemeindehaus", which is more aligned with the context of a community or council building in this sentence.
tenant → Mieter → Mieterin  	eviction → Vertreibung → Delogierung  	Cornwall House → Cornwall House → Cornwall Housing  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Mieter" (male tenant) is used instead of "Mieterin" (female tenant), which significantly changes the gender reference that aligns with "her" in the source sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Vertreibung" (displacement) is a mistranslation of "eviction", which is more accurately translated as "Delogierung" in this specific legal context, as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	3. "Cornwall House" is a mistranslation of "Cornwall Housing". They are distinct entities, and this violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule because "House" should be "Housing" to match the intended reference in the source sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with the reference translation in terms of meaning and the use of words. While "Handlungen" (actions) and "Taten" (deeds) differ slightly, they are contextually appropriate and do not significantly change the sentence's meaning, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
forward → aufkamen → auf uns zugegangen		**Explanation:** "aufkamen" (emerged/arose) is a mistranslation of "forward." The intended meaning is that members of the community came forward to provide information. The correct expression "auf uns zugegangen" (approached us) conveys the intended action more accurately. This violation falls under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "aufkamen" changes the context of how the community members participated.
neighbours → Nachbarn → einigen  	antisocial → unsoziales → antisoziales  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Nachbarn" lacks the specification "einigen" (some), which is present in the reference translation. This changes the scope of whom the comfort is directed toward. "unsoziales" (unsocial) is a mistranslation of "antisocial", which alters the degree of severity implied by "antisocial behaviour".
property → Besitz → Haus		**Explanation:** The word "Besitz" (property) in the candidate translation is technically a valid translation of "property" but does not match the context provided by the reference translation which uses "Haus" (house), suggesting a more specific type of property. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the translation should adhere closely to the reference context when possible for accuracy in meaning. The phrase "in ihren 20 Jahren" is acceptable as it conveys the same information as "über 20" in context, so no error is marked there.
dirty → Muttstat → Matratze  	floor → Boden → Schlafzimmer  	bedrooms → Fundamente → Schlafzimmer  	eviction → Vertreibung → Delogierung  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Muttstat" is not a valid translation for "mattress" ("Matratze"), violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Boden" (ground/foundation) was mistranslated in terms of context for "floor" which refers to a bedroom. This changes the intended location.	3. "Fundamente" (foundations) replaces "bedrooms," altering the meaning significantly. Bedrooms ("Schlafzimmer") are rooms inside a house, whereas "Fundamente" refers to the base of the building.	4. "Vertreibung" (displacement/banishment) does not accurately convey the context of a housing "eviction," addressed as "Delogierung" which directly corresponds to eviction in housing contexts.
housing → Wohnarbeiter → Hausverwaltung  	piles → Müllplätze → Müllberge  		**Explanation:** "Wohnarbeiter" (housing workers) is a mistranslation of "Arbeiter der Hausverwaltung" (workers of the housing administration), which changes the meaning as it refers more narrowly to workers specifically dealing with housing administration. "Müllplätze" (trash sites/spots) is a mistranslation of "Müllberge" (piles of rubbish), which significantly alters the quantity and nature of the waste described.
70g → 700 g → 70g  	scales → Skalen → Waagen  	paraphernalia → Paraphornalia → Paraphernalien  		**Explanation:**  	1. "700 g" (700 grams) is a mistranslation of "70g", which changes the quantity significantly, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	2. "Skalen" (scales) does not properly fit the context in German, as "Waagen" is the correct translation for measuring devices, aligning with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	3. "Paraphornalia" is a misspelling of "paraphernalia," which in German should be "Paraphernalien," reflecting the intended term and following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
possession → beworben → Besitz  	drug → Medikaments → Droge  		**Explanation:** "beworben" (applied) is a mistranslation of "possession", which is more accurately translated as "Besitz" in this legal context. It follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the legal implication entirely. "Medikaments" (medication) is a mistranslation of "drug", which should be "Droge" to convey the correct legal meaning. This adheres to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules.
headstone → Kopfstein → Grabstein		**Explanation:** "Kopfstein" is a mistranslation of "headstone". In this context, a "headstone" refers to a monument marking a grave, which is correctly translated as "Grabstein". "Kopfstein" literally translates to "cobblestone" in English, which does not fit the intended meaning in context, thereby violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
1. homeless → obdachlos → ohne Obdach		**Explanation:** "obdachlos" directly translates to "homeless," matching the source, but the reference uses "ohne Obdach," a more nuanced expression for "without shelter." However, it's debatable if this significantly changes the meaning since "obdachlos" fits the context. Given the ambiguity, this could have been overlooked. Still, considering the rule "Prioritize Meaningful Errors," we note it as a potential mismatch.		2. private housing → Privatwohnungen → private Unterkunft		**Explanation:** "Privatwohnungen" means "private apartments," whereas "private Unterkunft" means "private accommodation." The key mistranslation here is "Wohnungen" (apartments) versus "Unterkunft" (accommodation). The candidate's choice implies multiple apartments rather than a singular accommodation, which slightly alters the understanding of Tanya's living situation, thus constituting a meaningful error.
walls → Mauern → Zimmerwände  	scrawled → zerstreut → beschmiert  		**Explanation:** "Mauern" (walls) is a general term, but "Zimmerwände" (room walls) is more specific to the context of the rooms in the house. This requires correction to convey the specific part of the house in question. "zerstreut" (scattered) is an incorrect translation of "scrawled", which suggests the graffiti was written or drawn, not simply scattered around.
rules → Briefe → Hausordnung  	evict → verurteilen → delogieren  		**Explanation:** "Briefe" (letters) is a mistranslation of "rules", which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence since it suggests rules of correspondence rather than housing rules. Similarly, "verurteilen" (convict) is a mistranslation of "evict", which changes the nature of the action police intend to take. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, as the actions and the context are altered.
eviction → Beweisung → Delogierung  	warning → klar → Warnung
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words in the candidate translation such as "Schuldzuweisungen" (recriminations), "verhalten" (behave), and "betroffen" (affected) are reasonable translations of the corresponding terms in the reference sentence. Although there are slight differences in phrasing, these are acceptable variations that do not significantly change the overall meaning of the sentence. Thus, there are no significant mistranslations at the word level that would warrant listing.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:**  	The candidate translation effectively conveys the same meaning as the reference. The word choices such as "kriminelles" for "criminal", "asoziales" for "antisocial", and structural constructs align well with the intended meaning in both translations. Thus, no meaningful errors, as defined by the instructions, are present.
military → Billigflugzeugs → Militärjet	skims → Stränd → überfliegt		**Explanation:** "Billigflugzeugs" (cheap airplane) is a mistranslation of "military jet", which significantly changes the context from a powerful military presence to something unrelated. "Stränd" appears to be an incorrect rendition related to "beach" or a misspelling and is misplaced, where "skims" should convey the action of flying closely over, which "überfliegt" captures. These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
tourists → Küstenschifffahrt → Sonnenanbeter  		**Explanation:** "Küstenschifffahrt" (coastal shipping) is a mistranslation of "sun worshipping" (Sonnenanbeter), which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as the phrase significantly changes the meaning and context related to the activity of the tourists.
Portuguese → portugiesische → portugisiesches  	plane → Luftwaffe → Flugzeug  	swooped → schlug → Sturzflug  	low → niedrig → Sturzflug  		**Explanation:**   	1. "portugiesische" is correctly translated as "Portuguese," but its order in the sentence has led to confusion about the noun it modifies ("Luftwaffe" vs. "Flugzeug"). However, the reference structure, "Ein portugisiesches P-3C Orion Flugzeug," implies a more straightforward composition. The better fit in context is "portugisiesches," which indicates a structural rather than a direct word choice error.	2. "Luftwaffe" (air force) is used instead of directly translating "plane," which is "Flugzeug" in the reference. The phrase should directly convey "plane."	3. "schlug" (hit/struck) is used instead of "Sturzflug" (swooped). The key concept of the movement being a swoop is lost with "schlug in," making "Sturzflug" the appropriate correction.	4. "niedrig" (low) is separately translated but loses the descriptive nuance captured in "Sturzflug," fulfilling a similar descriptive purpose in the source.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While there are some differences in phrasing between the candidate and the reference ("Luftwaffe" vs "Luftstreitkräfte"), "on a training flight" translated as "ein Ausbildungsflug", and "no risk to safety" translated as "kein Sicherheitsrisiko" convey the same meaning correctly. Therefore, in line with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule and ensuring no significant change in the overall meaning, there are no single-word translation errors in this candidate translation.
1. terrified → schreckliche → verängstigte  	2. low-flying jet → Niedriglohnjet → tieffliegender Jet  	3. packed → verpackten → vollen  		**Explanation:**  		1. "schreckliche" (terrible) is a mistranslation of "terrified" (verängstigte), significantly changing the description of the tourists. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it alters their emotional state.	2. "Niedriglohnjet" (low-wage jet) is a mistranslation of "low-flying jet" (tieffliegender Jet). This results in a nonsensical phrase, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	3. "verpackten" (packed, as in packaged) is incorrect for "packed" in the sense of crowded (vollen). This mistranslation alters the context of the beach's occupancy.
footage → Bilder → Videoaufnahmen  	sunseekers → Sonnenstraße → Sonnenanbetern  	stretch → Annäherung → Strandabschnitt  		**Explanation:** 	- "Bilder" (pictures) is a mistranslation of "footage," which should be "Videoaufnahmen" to convey the correct visual media format.	- "Sonnenstraße" (sun street) is incorrectly used instead of "Sonnenanbetern" (sunseekers), which changes the meaning significantly as it refers to people.	- "Annäherung" (approach) is a mistranslation of "stretch," which should be "Strandabschnitt" (stretch of sand), as it refers to a physical area rather than movement.
rose → stiegen → sprangen  	jet engines → Jetmotoren → Düsentriebwerke  	concerned → besorgt → Sorgen zu machen  		**Explanation:**  	1. **rose → stiegen → sprangen**: "stiegen" translates to "ascended" or "climbed", which is a mistranslation of "rose" in this context, where "sprangen" (jumped up) is more accurate as per the reference. This error violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "stiegen" does not fit the scenario of spontaneously standing up due to concern.	   	2. **jet engines → Jetmotoren → Düsentriebwerke**: "Jetmotoren" (jet engines) is technically correct but "Düsentriebwerke" is the more precise term used for aircraft engines in German, emphasizing technical accuracy. Following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, in this context, it is considered slightly misleading as it does not convey the same precision as "Düsentriebwerke". 		3. **concerned → besorgt → Sorgen zu machen**: The word "concerned" is translated as "besorgt", which is a direct translation, but the reference uses "Sorgen zu machen" (to make worries), giving a deeper and more dynamic sense of becoming concerned. While not a direct error, it slightly misrepresents the intent of the source sentence in context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the source sentence. Although there is a slight punctuation difference (a comma) between the candidate and reference translation, it does not constitute a meaningful error and does not affect the single-word translation, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
videos → Videos → Videos (no meaningful error)	fly-by → Fliegens → Fly-By	point → Punkt → Moment		**Explanation:** 	- "Videos" is correctly translated, thus showing "videos → Videos" reflects no error.	- "Fly-by" as "Fliegens" is incorrect; the German "Fly-By" retains the original event specificity. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, as "Fliegens" doesn't convey the correct meaning. 	- "Point" translated as "Punkt" is a potential area of error because "Moment" fits more contextually, but "Punkt" can be used interchangeably in other contexts. Considering strict adherence to the rules, this is marked as an error due to the contextual shift from a general "point" to a specific "moment".
surfing → suchte → Surfen  	swear → vereidige → fühlte sich so an  		**Explanation:** "suchte" (searched) is a mistranslation of "surfing", which changes the activity described in the sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "searching" does not match the activity of "surfing". "vereidige" (swear as in oath-taking) does not capture the conditional feeling described by "swear it felt like", which should convey a sense of emotion or perception, better captured by the reference's "fühlte sich so an".
terrified → erschreckt → in Panik versetzt  	murk → Mund → Dunkelheit  	altitude → Höhe → tief  		**Explanation:** "erschreckt" (startled) is a mistranslation of "terrified", which significantly changes the intensity of the emotion. "Mund" (mouth) is a mistranslation of "murk", indicating a completely different concept. "Höhe" (height) is not incorrect by itself, but the context requires "tief" (low) to convey the sense of flying low, thus it changes the intended meaning of the sentence.
fall → fallen → fliegen		**Explanation:** "fallen" (to fall) is a mistranslation of "fly low" in this context. The intended action involves controlled flight ("fliegen"), not falling, which significantly alters the meaning related to the flight operation's purpose and safety procedure. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "fall" does not fit the intended meaning.
jet → die Jet → der Jet  	flown → untergeflogen → flog  	air force → Luftwaffe → Luftstreitkräfte  		**Explanation:** "die Jet" is incorrect since "Jet" is a masculine noun in German, so the correct article should be "der" as a subject in nominative case, matching with the reference "der Jet". "untergeflogen" (undercut) here is not appropriate in the context of flight altitude, whereas "flog" (flew) from the reference accurately reflects the original intent. "Luftwaffe" refers to the specific branch of the military known as the Air Force, whereas "Luftstreitkräfte" is a more general term utilized here in the reference for broader context, but in the context provided, "air force" should accurately refer to its conventional understanding or direct translation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the original meaning of the source sentence. While there are some differences in wording between the candidate and the reference translation, these do not result in significant changes in meaning. The words used in the candidate translation fit the context appropriately, and there is no clear mistranslation at the single-word level. Therefore, according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, no errors are reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation, the phrases and their meanings align sufficiently with both the source and reference translations. The key elements "conditions", "thick fog", "smoke from wildfires", and "obscured his visibility" are accurately rendered in the candidate, with appropriate contextual substitutes or stylistic variations that remain true to the intended meaning. Thus, per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, there are no significant mistranslations to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The differences in word choice between "Ausbildungsflug" and "Trainingsflug" or "Fischereiboote" and "Fischerboote" do not significantly change the meaning, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, no single-word translation errors are present.
Supercup → Vermutung → Supercup  		**Explanation:** "Vermutung" (guess/assumption) is a mistranslation of "Supercup". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it changes the context of the sentence from a sporting event to an abstract concept.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the intended meaning throughout the sentence, with no significant deviation from the reference translation. Both translations convey the same information about FC Barcelona aiming for their first title in the new football season.
away game → weggefahrenen → auswärts  	second leg → zweite Bein → Rückspiel  	Supecup → Supecup → Supercup  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Weggefahrenen" is a mistranslation of "away game" as it implies something has 'driven away,' which doesn't fit the context of a sports match location. In this context, "auswärts" (outward/away) is appropriate.	   	2. "Zweite Bein" translates to "second leg" as if referring to a second physical limb, which is incorrect in the context of a sports match series. The correct term in sports for a scheduling instance is "Rückspiel" (return match/second leg).		3. "Supecup" is a misspelling of "Supercup," which, while not a meaning change, is a transliteration typo that needs correction to match the reference.
two-time → zweimaligen → Double  	finalists → Spielfinalismen → Cupfinalisten  	Europa League → Europameisterschaften der Liga → Europa-League  	champions → regierenden → Champion  	football tournament → Fußballtourismus → Fußball-Turnier  		**Explanation:**  	- "zweimaligen" (two-time) does not capture the award-specific meaning of "Double" in the reference context where "Doublegewinner" implies winning two specific titles.	- "Spielfinalismen" is not a correct or meaningful term for "Cupfinalisten" in German, which accurately translates "finalists."	- "Europameisterschaften der Liga" is incorrect for "Europa-League." The context here is specific to a particular league, not a generic European championship.	- "regierenden" is correct in context (meaning "reigning"), though "Champion" is the more precise single term desired in the context.	- "Fußballtourismus" changes the meaning entirely from "football tournament" to "football tourism," indicating a mistranslation in terms of event type.
goalkeeper → Ziegenhalter → Goalie  		**Explanation:** "Ziegenhalter" (goatherd) is a mistranslation of "goalkeeper". This significantly alters the meaning, as it changes the profession of Marc-Andre ter Stegen.
1. training → Ausbildung → Training  	2. German → Deutschland → Deutsche  	3. pulled → gezogen → erlitt  	4. ligament → Knie → Bänderstauchung  		**Explanation:** "Ausbildung" refers to education or training in a professional sense, while "Training" in this context refers to physical sports training. "Deutschland" (Germany) is erroneously used instead of "Deutsche" (German person). "Gezogen" (pulled) is a literal translation that does not fit the context of an injury; "erlitt" (suffered) is more appropriate. "Knie" (knee) as a mistranslation implies missing out on specifying the "ligament" injury, which is captured by "Bänderstauchung".
Chilean → chilenische → chilenische  	international → Internationale → Internationale  	competing → kämpfen → wetteifern  	for → um → um  	status → Status → Status  	number → Nr. → Nummer  	one → 1 → eins  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation contains a series of significant mistranslations:		- "Chilean" (der chilenische) follows the correct form but can lead to confusion due to grammatical gender; however, it aligns with the reference, so no mistranslation here.	- "international" is a correct noun translation, but not reported due to the same alignment.	- The translation "kämpfen" (fight) can inaccurately suggest a physical battle, instead of "wetteifern" (compete/rival), which fits the context of competition for a position/status, following **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.	- "for" (um) and "status" (Status) are consistent with the reference and maintain the sentence's intent, requiring no adjustment.	- "Nr. 1" versus "Nummer eins" are translation preferences but doesn't constitute an error because both denote the same concept semantically. However, "Nr." represents a variation, allowed by **Acceptable Variations** principle.
jersey → Spitzfindigkeiten → Vortritt  		**Explanation:** "Spitzfindigkeiten" (sophistications) is a mistranslation for "jersey", a word that refers to a sports uniform in this context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Spitzfindigkeiten" does not fit the context of something worn in a game. The correct word should align with "Vortritt", which implies giving preference or precedence, generally understood as "wearing the jersey" in this context.
1. compulsory → obligatorischen → Pflicht	2. champions → Champions → Meister	3. fitness → Eignung → Fitnesszustand	4. friendly → freundlichen → Test	5. to → bis → von/demütigt wurden		**Explanation:** The word "obligatorischen" is not the correct term used for sports contexts, where "Pflicht" is more common for "compulsory" matches. "Champions" directly translates to "Meister" in the context of sports and titleholders. The candidate's "Eignung" refers to suitability and is not synonymous with "Fitnesszustand," meaning physical fitness. "Freundlich" suggests demeanor rather than a match type, where "Testspiel" is correct. Finally, "bis" indicates a range rather than a result ("von Liverpool mit dem Ergebnis 0:4" or "demütigt wurden" match the negative connotation of a 0-4 loss).
friendly → Freund → Probegalopp		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Freund" (friend) instead of the correct translation "Probegalopp" (warm-up match or friendly match). This significantly changes the meaning of the sentence by taking "friendly" literally as "friend" instead of the intended context of a "friendly" match.
(Extra-Niederlage → Extra-Niederlage → Niederlage nach Verlängerung)  	(Supercus → Supercus → Supercup)		**Explanation:** The translation "Extra-Niederlage" for "extra-time defeat" significantly alters the intended meaning, where "extra" should pertain to "time" and not modify "defeat". The reference translates it as "Niederlage nach Verlängerung," where "Verlängerung" (extra-time) correctly modifies the form of the defeat. "Supercus" is a mistranslation of "Supercup," altering the meaning as it refers to an event title. It appears to be a typographical error and should align with "Supercup" as per the reference.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While there are differences between the candidate and reference translations, such as "Siegen" (victories) vs. "Erfolgen" (successes), and "Rekordinhaber" (record-holders) vs. "Rekordsieger" (record winners), these differences do not significantly alter the meaning or violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Both translations accurately convey that Barcelona holds the record with eleven wins, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
league → Liga → Liga  	taking → nimmt → zu  	Gold → Gold → Tischtennis-Gold  		**Explanation:** 		1. **league → Liga → Liga:** There is no mistranslation here; "Liga" is correctly translated from "league."		2. **taking → nimmt → zu:** "nimmt" (takes) is incorrect in this context where "zu" (to) more appropriately conveys moving towards or achieving table tennis Gold, matching the reference.		3. **Gold → Gold → Tischtennis-Gold:** While "Gold" is otherwise correct, the specific phrase "Tischtennis-Gold" (table tennis Gold) is more appropriate to maintain precision and clarity. Hence, aligning it with the context as per the reference translation where the word "Tischtennis" emphasizes the subject correctly in conjunction with "Gold".
table tennis → tennisolympische → Tischtennis  	champion → Kämpfer → Olympiasieger  		**Explanation:** "tennisolympische" is a mistranslation of "table tennis". The error impacts the meaning significantly as it misses the specific sport, violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule to isolate "table tennis". The word "Kämpfer" (fighter) is a mistranslation of "champion". In this context, the correct term should be "Olympiasieger" (Olympic champion), which better represents the athletic achievement, aligning with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
1. beat → Schlag → besiegte  	2. defending champion → Verteidiger → Titelverteidiger  	3. final → Endfassung → Finale		**Explanation:**  	- "Schlag" (noun form of "strike" or "hit") is a mistranslation for the verb "beat," which should be "besiegte" (defeated) to convey winning a match.	- "Verteidiger" translates to "defender," which does not carry the specific sports connotation needed. "Titelverteidiger" (defending champion) fits the context in sports.	- "Endfassung" translates to "final version" rather than the contextually appropriate "Finale" (final match), making it a significant error.
World → Welt → Weltranglisten-Erste  	grand → großen → Grand  	Championship → Weltmeisterschaft → WM  	Cup → Weltmeisterschaft → Weltcup  	tournament → Turnkammer → Finalturnier  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation contains several errors:	- "World" is translated as "Welt" instead of the specific title "Weltranglisten-Erste" (world number one).	- "grand" is incorrectly translated as "großen" rather than retaining the term "Grand".	- "Championship" is repeated and mistranslated both times as "Weltmeisterschaft" instead of "WM" (World Championship) and "Weltcup" (World Cup).	- The phrase "final tournament" is mistranslated as "Turnkammer", which does not capture the intended meaning of "Finalturnier" (final tournament) in this context.
bronze → Bronzemedale → Bronze		**Explanation:** "Bronzemedale" (bronze medal) is an unnecessary expansion and incorrect placement, which affects the meaning of the sentence. The correct reference indicates just "Bronze", which prioritizes the bronze place, aligning with the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
men → Männer → Chinesen  	final → Abschluss → Endspiel  	fought → gekämpft → machten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Männer" (men) is a broader term, while "Chinesen" (Chinese men/people) captures the specific nationality, following the context given in the source sentence.	2. "Abschluss" (conclusion/completion) is incorrectly translated for "final", which specifically refers to a sports competition round. The correct word "Endspiel" conveys the intended meaning of reaching the final stage of a competition.	3. "gekämpft" (fought) implies a physical fight, whereas "machten" (made/did) fits the idiomatic expression "machten sich den Titel untereinander aus", meaning to contest or decide the title among themselves, better captures the intended meaning without implying physical combat.
third → dritten → dritter  	singles → einzigen → Einzel  	Chinese → Sportler → Chinese  		**Explanation:** 		- "dritten" (third) is already correct in the candidate translation, but to explain the error in context, the inflection must be corrected to match "dritter". This is important because "dritter" is grammatically correct in this placement, and specificity is pivotal in "third time".	- "einzigen" (only) is a mistranslation of "singles", changing the meaning from a specific event (singles title) to being indistinct (only title). 	- "Sportler" (athlete) is a more general term compared to "Chinese", which refers specifically to the nationality, a notable distinction in the context of the Olympics. 		Let's focus solely on the single-word translation issues without overexplaining acceptable variations.
non-Chinese → nicht-chinesische → Nicht-Chinese  	athlete → Sportler → Nicht-Chinese  	Lower Austria → Unterösterreich → NÖ  		**Explanation:**  	1. "nicht-chinesische" (non-Chinese) should be "Nicht-Chinese" to correctly capture the identity noun form used in the reference, making "Nicht-Chinese" the more accurate term.	2. "Sportler" (athlete) is a mistranslation since the focus in the reference is on the specific identity as a "Nicht-Chinese", which is not accurately captured just by saying "athlete".	3. "Unterösterreich" (Lower Austria) should be abbreviated as "NÖ" to match the reference and the typical abbreviation used in context.
they → Sie → sie  	coaches → Reisebusse → Coaches  	sets → Stationen → Sätzen  		**Explanation:** "Sie" is capitalized incorrectly and changes the meaning, as it should be in lowercase to match the reference "sie" (they). "Reisebusse" (buses) is a mistranslation of "coaches", which refers to people who provide guidance, not vehicles, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Stationen" (stations) is a mistranslation of "sets", which should be "Sätzen" in the context of a game or match.
charges → Anschuldigungen → Schützlinge  		**Explanation:** "Anschuldigungen" (accusations) is a mistranslation of "charges", which in this context refers to "wards" or "people they are responsible for", thus changing the meaning significantly. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it changes the nature of what was left to fight.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The phrase "Up until now" is acceptably translated as "Bisher" in German. Both versions convey the same meaning of actions or events leading up to the current point in time. The remaining words in the candidate sentence ("habe ich für mein Land gespielt") also correctly capture the essence of the source sentence and match the reference in terms of meaning. Hence, there are no significant errors that change the overall meaning, aligning with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
final → Endlich → Finale		**Explanation:** "Endlich" translates to "finally" in German, indicating a mistranslation of "final". The correct translation should be "Im Finale" meaning "In the final," following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The rest of the sentence components convey the correct meaning.
gold → Gold- und Silbermedaillen → Gold- und Silbermedaillengewinner  	posed → stellten → posierten  	with → unter → mit  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Gold- und Silbermedaillen" (gold and silver medals) is a mistranslation of "gold and silver medallists" which significantly alters the meaning as it refers to the objects rather than the people (medal winners).  	2. "stellten" (placed or set) is a mistranslation of "posed" in this context, as it refers to the physical act of posing for a photograph, following **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.  	3. "unter" (under) is a mistranslation of "with" regarding being next to or alongside the flag, not underneath it, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
match → Spiel → Match  		**Explanation:** "Spiel" (game) is a mistranslation of "match", which specifically refers to a competitive event. While "Spiel" can sometimes be used interchangeably, in this context, the term "Match" better captures the specific nature of the event, thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
first → zuerst → ersten  	fight → abfedern → kämpfen  		**Explanation:** "zuerst" (first) does not correctly convey "in the first set" as "ersten Satz" would. "abfedern" (to cushion) is an incorrect translation of "fight off," which should be "kämpfen" or a similar term conveying a struggle in the context of a competitive match. These changes lead to a significant alteration in meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
**(set → legte → bestimmte)**  		**Explanation:** The candidate word "legte" (laid) is a mistranslation of "set" in this context. The intended meaning is that he "set the pace," which would be more accurately translated as "bestimmte" (determined), aligning with the reference sentence, respecting the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. The specific action pertains to establishing a rhythm or speed, not physically placing something, hence "set → legte → bestimmte" is marked as erroneous.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation, "Dominanz" is a suitable translation for "dominance", "Spiel" for "match", and "spannend" for "exciting". While “Spiel” and “Match” could be viewed as different choices, in context both are appropriate translations for "match", maintaining the meaning from the source sentence. The rest of the translation aligns with the reference, offering no significant change in meaning.
volleys → Vollen → Ballwechsel		**Explanation:** "Vollen" is a mistranslation of "volleys". The correct translation in this context is "Ballwechsel", which refers to exchanges or rallies in sports, preserving the intended meaning. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, prioritizing the most significant mistranslation.
bronze → Bronzenmedailspiel → Bronze  	match → Bronzenmedailspiel → Spiel  	against → gegen → gegen den  		**Explanation:** "Bronzenmedailspiel" combines "Bronze" and "medal match," but mistranslates both the words "bronze" and "match" compared to the reference. The candidate's construction is inaccurate and less idiomatic. "gegen" should be "gegen den" for proper grammatical formation.
1. Belarussian → Belarussen → Weißrusse  	   **Explanation:** "Belarussen" refers to "Belarussians" as a plural form, whereas "Weißrusse" is singular and matches the source sentence's singular "The Belarussian." This fits the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	   	2. rib → Quartalsschluss → Rippenverletzung  	   **Explanation:** "Quartalsschluss" (quarter-end) is a mistranslation of "rib," which should be "Rippenverletzung" (rib injury). The error affects meaning significantly, violating **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.		3. quarter-final → Quartalsschluss → Viertelfinale  	   **Explanation:** "Quartalsschluss" instead of "Viertelfinale" changes the context and is relevant to the match context. It violates **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.		4. German European Champion → deutsche Europameisterschaft → deutschen Europameister  	   **Explanation:** "deutsche Europameisterschaft" (German European Championship) is incorrect as it refers to an event, whereas the source refers to an individual champion "Dimitrij Ovtcharov," matching "deutschen Europameister." This aligns with **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.		5. place → Platz → Blech  	   **Explanation:** The reference "Blech" (colloquial for fourth place) adds nuance, but "Platz" (place) is not necessarily an error in the context since both mean placement ranking. However, contextually specific translations like this may be marked depending on more precise expectations but should not violate the rules strictly here.		**Note:** As for the word "letztendlich" vs. "letztlich," this is a nuanced stylistic choice rather than a meaningful error. "Medical treatment" translating to "medizinische Behandlung" rather than "ärztlicher Behandlung" is a slight deviation but not sufficiently significant to change the sentence's meaning.
table tennis → Tafelnis → Tischtennis		**Explanation:** "Tafelnis" is a mistranslation of "table tennis". This is a significant error as "Tafelnis" does not exist in German and fails in conveying the intended sport. Following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, we identify this as a key mistranslation affecting the sentence's meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "große" (huge) and "gewaltige" (enormous) convey a similar sense of size and impact in this context, so the candidate translation is acceptable. The names "Donald Trump" and "Donald Trumpp" differ only in spelling, but this type of minor typographical error does not affect meaning as required by the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Overall, the meaning of the sentence is preserved, thus no significant single-word errors are present.
significant → großen → massiven  	fears → Angst → Sorgen  		**Explanation:** "großen" (big/great) is a mistranslation of "significant", which in this context should align more closely with "massiven" (massive/significant), a more accurate descriptor for the level of concern. This misaligns with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** instruction by not capturing the severity indicated in the source. Similarly, "Angst" (fear) is not a direct equivalent for "fears" in this context, where "Sorgen" (concerns/worries) is the correct translation, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since it better conveys the political context in the source sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although there is a slight variation in wording, the candidate translation effectively conveys the same meaning as the source sentence and is consistent with the reference translation. There are no mistranslated or incorrect words in terms of conveying the intended meaning.
1. multi-millionaire → millionäre Millionär → Multimillionär	2. performance → Leistung -> Auftreten	3. correspondents report → als Korrespondentenbericht → wie Korrespondenten berichteten		**Explanation:**		1. The phrase "multi-millionaire" is mistranslated as "millionäre Millionär". The correct translation is "Multimillionär", adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the redundancy changes the intended meaning significantly.		2. "performance" is mistranslated as "Leistung", which generally means "performance" in terms of capability or achievement but does not fit well in this context. "Auftreten" (demeanor) is a more contextually accurate translation, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.		3. "as correspondents report" is mistranslated as "als Korrespondentenbericht", which is a noun form not accurately representing the action of reporting. The correct phrase in this context is "wie Korrespondenten berichteten", following the **Identify Mistranslations** rule.
doubt → Frage → Zweifel  	is growing → wächst → wachsen  		**Explanation:** "Frage" (question) is a mistranslation of "doubt", which changes the intended meaning to imply curiosity rather than skepticism. "Wächst" (grows) translates "is growing", but "Zweifel" (doubt) is plural in this context, hence "wachsen" is required for subject-verb agreement.
huge → enorme → gewaltige  	Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	assistance → Hilfe → Unterstützung  	audience → Publikum → vor  		**Explanation:** 	1. "enorme" (enormous) is a mistranslation of "huge", with "gewaltige" more accurately capturing the reference's emphasis.	2. "Trumpf" is not the correct name; "Trump" should remain as in the source.	3. "Hilfe" (help) is a less formal translation of "assistance," with "Unterstützung" providing a closer match to the intended meaning.	4. "Publikum" misinterprets the context of "audience," where "vor" aligns better with the phrase "sagte Trump vor evangelikalen Christen" in a manner consistent with the reference translation structure.
blamed → schuldigte → Schuld seien  	dressing-down → Abwärtsverfahren → Medienschelte  		**Explanation:**  	1. "schuldigte" is a mistranslation of "blamed." In the candidate, "schuldigte" translates to "accused," which somewhat differs from assigning blame as indicated in the reference. The reference uses "Schuld seien" (blamed are), representing the meaning more accurately.	   	2. "Abwärtsverfahren" is a clear mistranslation of "dressing-down." "Abwärtsverfahren" translates to "downward procedure," which fails to convey the meaning of "dressing-down" as a reprimand. The term "Medienschelte" used in the reference accurately reflects a reprimand or scolding directed at the media. This change adheres to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate word "schwanken" and the reference word "wackeln" are both appropriate translations for "wavering" in the context, maintaining the intended meaning. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where both words can convey the same concept effectively.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "sicherer Sitz" and "sichere Bank" convey the meaning of a "safe seat" in the context of political discourse. Because either expression can be used to describe a secure political stronghold in German, there are no significant meaning changes, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	competitor → Wettbewerber → Konkurrentin  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" (trump card) is a mistranslation of "Trump," which refers to the former U.S. President. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it changes the meaning to an unrelated concept. "Wettbewerber" (competitor) is a male term not aligned with the context where "Konkurrentin" (female competitor) is used in the reference. This demonstrates an error when compared with "Konkurrentin," given that Hillary Clinton, being a female figure in the context, aligns with the gender-specific term.
put → setzen → sehen		ahead → voran → vorn		bodies → Organe → Institute		**Explanation:**	- **"put" → "setzen" → "sehen":** The candidate word "setzen" (set/put) doesn't accurately capture the intended meaning in this context, where "sehen" (see) is more appropriate.	- **"ahead" → "voran" → "vorn":** The candidate word "voran" (forward) doesn't fit the context as well as "vorn" (ahead), which is a more accurate translation within this specific sentence structure.	- **"bodies" → "Organe" → "Institute":** "Organe" (organs) doesn't align with the context of institutions or sources used in election contexts in German where "Institute" is the appropriate term.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The differences in word order and structure between the candidate and reference translations do not significantly impact comprehension or accuracy. Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, there are no mistranslations to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation successfully conveys the meaning of the source sentence without significant translation errors. The variations in phrasing, such as "gefragt" (asked) for "how he would stop Clinton's rise, replying" and "aufhalten" (stop) for "Vormarsch" (advance), are within acceptable limits and do not alter the fundamental meaning of the sentence. Similarly, "schon früher getan" (done before) matches the essence of "bisher gemacht habe" (have done before). Therefore, according to the rules, no violations were detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Despite slight variations in phrasing (e.g., "fügte hinzu" vs. "schob hinterher"), the candidate translation correctly captures the meaning of the source sentence. Both translations convey the speaker's plan and intentions regarding the outcome, which is the priority, thus adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence, and the phrase "die Wahrheit sagen" is a valid way to express "telling the truth" in German, similar to the reference "die Wahrheit zu erzählen". There is no significant change in the meaning, so no errors are reported.
make → macht → reiche  	ok → hat → sei  	Trump → Trumpf → Trump  		**Explanation:**  	1. "macht" (does/makes) is a different interpretation of "make it" which in context means "succeed" or "reach". The reference uses "reiche" which conveys the correct meaning of managing to achieve a goal. This falls under **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.	2. "hat" (has) changes the structure from expressing a state/opinion (that's ok) to an incorrect past-tense verb form. The correct corresponding expression in the context is "sei" for "ist" (is), which aligns with the structure of expressing acceptance. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.	3. "Trumpf" is an incorrect translation of "Trump" (the name), significantly altering the meaning and referring to something unrelated to the person. Names should remain consistent across translations, therefore this violates **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence accurately translates "very nice way of life" to "sehr schönen Lebensweise," closely aligning with the reference "sehr guten Lebensweise." Both "schönen" and "guten" are acceptable translations for "nice" in this context, respecting the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Other components like "dann" for "then," "sagte er" for "he said," and "zurückgekehrt" for "return" convey the intended meaning effectively.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump." The word "Trumpf" typically refers to a "trump card" or advantage, whereas the sentence is intended to refer to the person, Donald Trump. Thus, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, this substitution introduces a clear error in proper noun translation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the essential meaning of the source sentence. "stattdessen" accurately reflects "instead", "republikanischen Kongresskandidaten" correctly conveys "Republican congressional candidates", and "mehr Unterstützung angeboten" aligns with "offered more support". Despite different phrasing, both translations express the intended idea without any significant meaning alteration, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
brazen → Brasen → dreister  	cheating → des Dopings → Betrug  	tests → Brasen → Test  		**Explanation:** "Brasen" is a mistranslation and non-existent word in this context, used incorrectly for "brazen." The phrase "des Dopings" doesn't properly represent "cheating," which should be "Betrug." Lastly, "tests" is referred to incorrectly as "Brasen," and should be "Test," reflecting the intended meaning. These errors significantly alter the meaning according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the source sentence's meaning. The differences between "Disziplinarausschuss" and "Disziplinarkommission" are acceptable variations and do not significantly alter the sentence's meaning or violate any task rules.
Kenia's track and field athletes → Kenia → Kenias Leichtathleten		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Kenia" (Kenya) is a simplification and leaves out "track and field athletes" which is essential for maintaining the context. According to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, we highlight "Kenia" as the incorrect part, needing the specification "Kenias Leichtathleten" to properly convey the intended meaning.
deceive → täuschen → Betrugsversuch  	coach → Bushaus → Trainer		**Explanation:** "täuschen" (deceive) partially translates the context but incorrectly simplifies the intended meaning of "an attempt to deceive" which is better captured by "Betrugsversuch" (an attempt at fraud). "Bushaus" is not a valid word for "coach" in the meaning of a sports team coach, which should be "Trainer". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it refers to a bus house, not appropriate in this context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the meaning of the source and reference translations. Although there are slight differences in wording, none of them result in a significant change in meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. The chosen words convey the intended message accurately, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
announced → kündigte → mitgeteilt  	coach → Bus → Coach  	runner → Trainers → Läufers  		**Explanation:**  	- "kündigte" (announced) is used instead of "mitgeteilt" (communicated), changing the implied method of communication.  	- "Bus" (bus) is a mistranslation for "coach", meaning someone who trains athletes, not a vehicle.  	- "Trainers" (trainer) instead of "Läufers" (runner) alters the role and identity of Ferguson Rotich, impacting the sentence's meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and the reference translation convey the same meaning even though they use different phrasing. Both translations effectively communicate that the managers of Kenya's team were informed by the doping officials. There are no single-word errors that significantly change the meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
(IAAF → IAF → IAAF)	(federation → Föderation → Weltverband)	stated → aufstellen → mitgeteilt		**Explanation:** 	1. "IAAF" is incorrectly translated as "IAF". This is a significant error, potentially ambiguous, and needs correction to maintain the proper organization name. 		2. "federation" is translated as "Föderation" but the reference uses "Weltverband," which more accurately conveys the significance and scope of the organization globally.		3. "stated" is mistranslated as "aufstellen" which means "to set up" but should have been translated to a word like "mitteilen" to convey the act of speaking or stating, which is contextually accurate. This change significantly alters the intended action being described in the sentence.
IAAF → IAF → IAAF  		**Explanation:** "IAF" is a mistranslation of "IAAF", which is significant as it refers to a specific organization, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the initials should match exactly.
went → besuchte → ist...gegangen  	alleged → behauptete → ausgegeben  	sample → Stichprobe → Probe  	signed → unterzeichnet → unterschrieben  		**Explanation:** 		1. "besuchte" (attended/visited) is a mistranslation of "went", as it implies visiting in a way that doesn't directly match "gehen" (to go), which is the intended context, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "behauptete" (claimed/asserted) is a mistranslation of "alleged", which in the context means pretending to be someone else, better captured by "ausgegeben".	3. "Stichprobe" (sample/test sample) refers to a test sample generally, while "Probe" (sample) is the correct word for a doping sample handed in.	4. "unterzeichnet" (signed) is a literal translation but doesn't fit the full context in which "unterschrieben" (signed) is more suitable as generally used in this context.		These errors significantly alter the meaning or tone of the sentence under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
accreditation → Akkreditierung → Akkreditierung  	World → Internationalen → Welt  	training → Schulungskontrollen → Trainingskontrollen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Akkreditierung" was translated correctly for "accreditation", so it remains unchanged.	- "Internationalen" is a mistranslation for "World". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it changes the specific agency from a world to an international context.	- "Schulungskontrollen" is a mistranslation for "training" controls. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it shifts the meaning away from the specific context of training.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source sentence in context. All the elements, such as "came fourth", "800-metre race", and "2015 World Championships in Beijing" are accurately translated. Therefore, no significant single-word translation errors are present, complying with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Rotich → Rotch → Rotich		**Explanation:** "Rotch" is a mistranslation of "Rotich". Personal names should be accurately translated unless there's an acceptable localization, which is not the case here, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The name should remain as "Rotich".
alleged → Angeblich → soll  	sportspeople → Sportlern → Sportler  	told → gesagt → informiert
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same overall meaning as the reference translation. The phrasing differences, such as "verhaftet" for "festgenommen worden", are acceptable variations and do not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence in context. This adheres to both the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. The use of "verfolgt" (follows/monitors) for "keeping a close eye" and "besonders aufmerksam" (particularly attentively) for "particularly close eye" retains the essential meaning, adhering to **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** guidelines. The contextual and substantive meaning remains intact, so no significant mistranslations are detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence when compared with the reference translation. Words such as "ausnahmsweise" (unusually) and "besonders" (particularly) preserve the intended emphasis and context. Therefore, there are no significant single-word translation errors to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon comparing the sentences, both the candidate and reference translations convey the intended meaning of the source sentence correctly. There are no significant single-word translation errors, as the primary concepts and terms like "pressure," "anti-doping law," and "functioning system of checks" are accurately captured. The variations in phrasing, such as "unter Druck gesetzt" versus "Druck ausgeübt," are both valid for expressing "put a lot of pressure," thus following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The differences in wording between the candidate and reference translations do not constitute translation errors as they are acceptable variations. Using "Olympischen Spiele" instead of "Olympia-Beginn" is fine in this context, especially since both versions maintain the intended meaning. Therefore, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, no meaningful errors are present.
countries → Länder → Ländern		measures → Antidopingmaßnahmen → Doping-Bekämpfung		comply → entsprechen → konform sind		**Explanation:**  	1. "Länder" is the wrong case compared to "Ländern" in the phrase where the removal of Kenya is discussed. Following grammatical standards for genitive or dative case usage, "Ländern" is appropriate in this context.	2. "Antidopingmaßnahmen" (anti-doping measures) does not match "Doping-Bekämpfung" (doping control). While both relate to doping, the reference emphasizes combating rather than measures, signaling a difference in the terms used.	3. "entsprechen" (correspond to) is not as precise as "konform sind" (are compliant with), which better captures the legal compliance aspect noted in the source and reference sentences.
running → Führen → Läufer  		**Explanation:** "Führen" (leading) is a mistranslation of "running," which changes the intended meaning from the activity of running to the concept of leading. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "running" in this context refers to the sport, not leadership or direction.
track and field → Spurensportler → Leichtathleten		**Explanation:** "Spurensportler" (trail athletes) is a mistranslation of "track and field athletes." In this context, "Leichtathleten" is the appropriate term for athletes participating in track and field events. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it significantly affects the intended meaning.
claim → behauptet → Vorwürfe  	mentality → betrügen → Mentalität  		**Explanation:** "behauptet" (claimed) is a mistranslation of "Vorwürfe" (allegations/accusations), which changes the nature of the reports. "betrügen" (to cheat) is not the correct translation for "mentality", which indicates an attitude or way of thinking, thus it should be "Mentalität" (mentality).
Richard → Richard Pund → Richard Pound	mirror → spiegeln → ähnliche		**Explanation:** 	- "Richard Pund" is a mistranslation of "Richard Pound" because the name has been altered, which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by changing the proper noun.	- "spiegeln" (mirror) is a mistranslation of "similar" because it doesn't convey the intended meaning of conducting a similar investigation; it distorts the nuance of the action that is meant to be taken. Thus, it is prioritized under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The words chosen maintain the core message of extensive and systematic doping across the sport, fitting the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules. The variations in expressions between the candidate and reference translations do not significantly alter meaning or violate translation accuracy.
track and field → Spuren- und Feldsportler → Leichtathleten		**Explanation:** "Spuren- und Feldsportler" is a literal mistranslation of "track and field athletes". The correct German term for "track and field athletes" is "Leichtathleten". The literal translation changes the meaning significantly, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** 	The candidate translation uses "Salzburg" and "mit," which do not significantly deviate in meaning or context from the reference translation using "Salzburger" and "mit." The context of the sentence remains intact, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as both "Salzburg" and "Salzburger" appropriately refer to the location in this context. Thus, there are no significant single-word translation errors.
Shakespeare anniversary year → Jahr Shakespeare-Jahrestag → Shakespeare-Jahr  	is putting on → setzt auf → präsentieren  	tragic couple → tragisches Paar → tragischem Liebespaar  	Juliet → Juliet → Julia  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Jahr Shakespeare-Jahrestag" is a mistranslation of "Shakespeare anniversary year," which should be "Shakespeare-Jahr" for clarity and context.	2. "setzt auf" generally means "sets up" or "places on," which is a mistranslation of "is putting on" in the context of organizing or presenting a play as "präsentieren."	3. "tragisches Paar" (tragic couple) does not fully capture the meaning of "tragischem Liebespaar" (tragic lovers), which conveys the romantic aspect relevant to the Shakespearean reference.	4. "Juliet" is left untranslated and should be "Julia" to match the German context and adhere to proper noun conventions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essence of the source sentence, given the context. The word "Überraschend" aligns with the surprise element related to Cecilia Bartoli, complying with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Although "Mit dabei" (featuring) is absent, the core meaning, emphasizing the surprise of Cecilia Bartoli's presence, remains effectively communicated, aligning with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
musical → Musik → Musical  	gripped → gefischt → erobert  		**Explanation:** "Musik" (music) is a mistranslation of "musical". It changes the meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as the sentence specifically refers to a theatrical genre, not just any music. "gefischt" (fished) is a mistranslation of "gripped" because it does not convey the intended metaphorical capturing of the audience's attention or emotional involvement, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
(Artistic Director → Künstlerdirektorin → künstlerische Leiterin)  	(musical → Musik → Musical)  	(childhood → Kindheit → Jugend)  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Künstlerdirektorin" (Director of Art) is a mistranslation for "Artistic Director", which in this context should be "künstlerische Leiterin" (Artistic Director as per conventional usage in artistic or cultural settings). This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the formal title is important.		2. "Musik" (music) is a general term that is incorrectly used in place of "musical", a type of theatrical performance, represented by "Musical" in the reference. It violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because "musical" is a specific type of art form, not to be confused with generic "music."		3. "Kindheit" (childhood) is a mistranslation of "Jugend" (youth). Although both refer to early stages of life, "Jugendtraum" (youth dream) reflects a somewhat more mature stage, consistent with the sentiment in the source and reference sentences, in line with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
orchestra pit → Orchester → Orchestergraben  	director → Direktor → Dirigenten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "orchestra pit" was translated as "Orchester," which means "orchestra" and not "orchestra pit." The correct word in this context is "Orchestergraben," which refers specifically to the section where the orchestra sits.	2. "director" was translated as "Direktor," which typically refers to a business director or leader. However, in the context of an orchestra, "Dirigent" is used to denote a conductor.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation successfully conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. Although there are differences in structure and expression between the candidate and reference translations, both effectively communicate that the subject is influenced by Latin American elements. Thus, no significant single-word translation errors are present.
melodies → Gefühlen → Melodie  		**Explanation:** "Gefühlen" (feelings) is a mistranslation of "melodies". This significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, as the sentence refers to musical components, not emotions. The correct word should be related to music, like "Melodie".
perfect formula → perfekte Formel → perfektes Rezept  	our → unseren → unser  		**Explanation:** "perfekte Formel" (perfect formula) is mistranslated from "perfect recipe," which alters the nuance related to something more suitable or formulaic rather than a metaphorical recipe. "unseren" (our) is incorrectly inflected; it should match "unser" in the singular neutral form to agree with "Orchester," as required by German grammar. This mistake is identified as significant under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Both "die Musik von Bernstein" and "Bernsteins Musik" are appropriate renderings of "Bernstein's music", and the structure of the sentence maintains the original intent. There are no significant, meaningful errors in translation.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation communicates the same meaning as the reference translation. "Bei dieser Produktion" is a common German expression for "in this production," and "ältere Maria" conveys the concept of "an older Maria" effectively. Both phrases maintain the intended meaning of the source sentence without significant distortion, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
remembers → Klugheit → Wehmut  	affair → bei → Liebschaft  		**Explanation:** "Klugheit" (cleverness) is a mistranslation of "wistfulness", which alters the emotional tone of the sentence, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "bei" (near) is a mistranslation of "with", changing the relationship in the phrase "with Tony", following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule for the preposition.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The difference between "von" and "der" in this context does not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence. Both translations convey that the role associated with Maria is the focus of fascination, complying with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and the reference translation convey the same meaning. "ungwöhnlich" (unusual) and "außergewöhnlich" (extraordinary) are near-synonyms that fit the context, and the structure of both sentences adequately reflects the emphasis intended by the source sentence. Thus, there are no meaningful translation errors to report under the given rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "die Persönlichkeit von Maria" and "Marias Persönlichkeit" accurately convey "Maria's personality," and neither "Und dann die" nor "Und dann wäre da noch" alters the core meaning of "And then there's." Thus, there are no significant single-word translation errors per the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
pretty → schön → pretty		witty → glänzend → witty		bright → glänzend → bright		**Explanation:** The word "schön" correctly translates "pretty," so it appears mistakenly here due to oversight. "glänzend" (glossy/shiny) mistranslates both "witty" and "bright," which changes the intended attributes expressed in the song lyrics. This is a significant alteration of their original meanings, thus constituting translation errors.
clever → Klugheit → klug  	naive → Naivität → naiv  		**Explanation:** "Klugheit" (cleverness) is a mistranslation of "clever" because it incorrectly translates the adjective into a noun. "Naivität" (naivety) is also a noun mistranslation of "naive," which should be an adjective to match the source sentence. These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as they disrupt the grammatical structure and intended meaning of the sentence. The rest of the sentence maintains the correct meaning and does not warrant reporting.
like → stimmt → ähnelt  	personality → Persönlichkeit → Charakter  		**Explanation:** "stimmt" (agrees) is a mistranslation of "like" in this context, as it should convey resemblance, which "ähnelt" (resembles) does. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Additionally, "Persönlichkeit" (personality) is a slightly different term compared to "Charakter" (character), but in this context, the reference suggests a deeper connection tied to heritage or traits, validating the mismatch under the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
opera singer → Opernsinger → Opernsängerin  	artist → Künstler → Künstlerin  		**Explanation:** "Opernsinger" is a mistranslation because it should be "Opernsängerin" to correctly convey the gender of "the opera singer," as indicated in the reference. "Künstler" is a mistranslation of "artist" because it is in the wrong gender form, where "Künstlerin" should be used to match the female subject "Cecilia." These changes respect the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the intended meaning of being honoured to work with her, akin to the source and reference sentences. Differences in phrasing (e.g., "große Ehre" vs "so eine Ehre") do not constitute a significant change in meaning, thus adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Hence, there are no translation errors to report.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning and nuances of the source sentence. Both "Dudamel ist ein so außergewöhnlicher Künstler" and "Dudamel ist so ein außergewöhnlicher Künstler" express the same appreciation of Dudamel as an exceptional artist, and "so leidenschaftlich" and "sehr leidenschaftlich" both effectively communicate the idea of passion. Therefore, there are no significant single-word translation errors present, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
conducting → Handeln → Dirigieren  		**Explanation:** The source word "conducting" is mistranslated as "Handeln" (acting/doing), while the correct term should be "Dirigieren" (conducting, in the musical sense). This significantly changes the meaning by not conveying the specific action of conducting music, thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the meaning of the source sentence correctly. The structural differences between "You see it" (Sie sehen es) and "Man sieht es" (One sees it) are acceptable translations in this context, and neither significantly changes the meaning. Similarly, while "in all his movements" and "in jeder seiner Bewegungen" show slight variation, this does not constitute a significant error under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Therefore, there are no single-word mistranslations that need to be reported.
great → große → riesige  	experience → Erfahrungen → Erfahrung  		**Explanation:** "große" (big) is a mistranslation of "great", which in this context means "excellent" and is better captured by "riesige" (huge, excellent). This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it affects the strength of the opportunity. Additionally, "Erfahrungen" (experiences, plural) is a mistranslation of "experience", which is singular and should be "Erfahrung", as per the reference sentence. This adheres to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the overall meaning of the source sentence accurately and does not contain single-word errors that could be considered mistranslations. The slight variations in phrasing, such as "mit Freude an das Leben heran" and "fröhliche Herangehensweise an das Leben", do not alter the intended meaning significantly and conform to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, no errors are reported.
American director → amerikanischen Direktor → amerikanischen Regisseur		bang up-to-date → aktuell → hochaktuell  		**Explanation:** "amerikanischen Direktor" is a mistranslation of "American director" because "Direktor" isn't the correct translation in this context; "Regisseur" accurately conveys the professional role of a director involved with film/theater, as per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "aktuell" (current) doesn't fully capture "bang up-to-date", as "hochaktuell" (highly current) better reflects the intended emphasis, fulfilling the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Puerto Ricans → Puerto Ricans → Puertorikaner  		**Explanation:** "Puerto Ricans" is not translated into German in the candidate translation, while in the reference, it is correctly translated as "Puertorikaner". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the term should be adapted to the target language.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the main points of the source sentence, and any differences such as "same issues" being translated as "dieselben Fragen" versus "gleichen Themen" still preserve the intended meaning. Both candidate and reference translations capture the comparative significance of the issues over time without significant deviation, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Fifty-nine → Neun → 59
London schoolgirl → Schülerin → Schulmädchen  	joined → beigetreten → anschloss  	killed → (missing) → getötet  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Schülerin" is a valid translation for "schoolgirl," but "Schulmädchen" is more specific to a young female student or girl, while "Schülerin" could refer to female students of various ages, potentially altering the meaning.	2. "beigetreten" means "joined," but the context of how it is used in the source may differ as "anschloss" suggests the act of joining in a more formal or involved sense, more aligned with the context of joining an organization like ISIL.	3. The translation is missing the word "killed" altogether, which is an important part of the source sentence, significantly altering the event described.
Schulmädchen → Schülern → Schulmädchen  	beizutreten → anzuschließen → anzuschließen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Schülern" (students) is a mistranslation of "schoolgirls". The specific reference to gender (girls) is essential and is captured in "Schulmädchen" in the reference, hence violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "beizutreten" (to join) is a valid translation of "anschließen". However, in this context, the reference specifically uses "anzuschließen" for "to join" when referring to joining a group or an organization. This maintains contextual accuracy following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Attorney → Anwaltin → Anwalt  		**Explanation:** "Anwaltin" (female attorney) is a mistranslation of "Attorney". The source and reference sentences both refer to "Tasnime Akunjee" with "Anwalt" (attorney), which aligns with the source. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, as the gender specification is incorrect in this context.
believed → wurde → vermutet		**Explanation:** The candidate word "wurde" (was) does not adequately reflect the meaning of "believed" in the source sentence, unlike the reference word "vermutet" (suspected, believed). This significantly changes the nuance of the sentence and violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules. The rest of the translation adequately communicates the intended message.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate and reference translations convey the same meaning despite using different expressions. The phrase "ihrer Familie zufolge" corresponds well with "nach Angaben ihrer Familie". The key actions and context regarding the plans and the war-torn country are preserved adequately between the sentences, satisfying the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
benefit → Nutzen → Gute  	tombstone → Baustein → Mahnung  	dissuade → abzubringen → abzuhalten  		**Explanation:** "Nutzen" (utility/benefit) is a mistranslation of "benefit" in this philosophical context, where the reference correctly uses "Gute" (good). "Baustein" (building block) is a mistranslation of "tombstone", which should be "Mahnung" (warning/reminder) in this figurative sense. "abzubringen" (talk someone out of) does not capture the preventive element in "abzuhalten" (to hold back), the intended meaning of "dissuade".
London → OstLondon → dem Osten Londons  	boarded → beförderten → stiegen  		**Explanation:** "OstLondon" (EastLondon) is incorrectly translated as a single word without separation or the correct preposition, which distorts the meaning in comparison to "dem Osten Londons" (the east of London), following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Beförderten" (transported) is a mistranslation of "boarded" as it changes the meaning of how they used the flight; the correct term in the reference is "stiegen" (boarded), which adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
(he → sie → sie)  	(a → eine → einen)  	(fighter → Kämpferin → Kämpfer)  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "eine ISIL-Kämpferin", which misrepresents the gender of the fighter from male "Kämpfer" in the reference. There is also no "he" in the source that corresponds to the "sie", but rather "she". The word "Kämpferin" is identified as the problematic word since it significantly changes the referred individual's gender, and the article "eine" aligns with this error by indicating feminine gender rather than masculine gender as in "einen", making both necessary to list.
Reid → Ried → Reid  	nominee → Kandidatin → Kandidaten  	if → wenn → im Fall eines Wahlsiegs  	he → er → sie  		**Explanation:** "Ried" is a misspelling of "Reid". The candidate uses "Kandidatin" (female nominee), which mismatches with "Kandidaten" (nominee); Garland is male. "wenn" (if) does not capture the condition "im Fall eines Wahlsiegs" (in case of a victory). "er" (he) incorrectly refers to Clinton, who is female, so "sie" (she) is correct. These errors are significant and change the meaning or the reference in the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation retains the intended meaning of the source sentence. The variations in phrasing do not significantly change the meaning, fulfilling the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. No specific single-word translation errors are evident when compared to the reference.
Garland's → des Landes → Garlands  		**Explanation:** "des Landes" (of the country) is a mistranslation of "Garland's", which significantly changes the person whose confirmation is being discussed. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it incorrectly identifies what has been blocked.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the integrity and meaning of the source sentence when compared to the reference translation. While some syntactic and lexical choices differ, they do not introduce significant meaning changes given the context. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where acceptable variations that maintain the intended meaning are not considered errors.
Thursday → Donnerstag → Donnerstag  	with → mit → mit  	credibility → Glaubwürdigkeit → Gewissheit  		**Explanation:**		1. "Thursday" is correctly translated as "Donnerstag" in the candidate, matching the reference.	2. "with" is correctly translated as "mit" in the candidate, which aligns with the reference.	3. "credibility" is mistranslated as "Glaubwürdigkeit" while the reference uses "Gewissheit" for "with some degree of certainty", indicating an error. The mistake is significant because "credibility" (Glaubwürdigkeit) and "certainty" (Gewissheit) have different implications, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
not → nicht → noch  	speculating → spekulieren → spekuliere  		**Explanation:** 		1. "noch" (yet) should be used instead of "nicht" (not) to convey the reference of "had not spoken" in the past perfect continuous sense, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	 	2. For "speculating," the candidate used "spekulieren," which does not fit the context as it suggests an ongoing action. The correct word is "spekuliere," aligning with the correct tense used in the context, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
rock the boat → rocken → für Unruhe sorgen  	pick → Pfiff → Kandidaten  		**Explanation:** "rocken" (to rock) is a mistranslation of "rock the boat," which idiomatically means "to cause unrest." This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "rocken" does not capture the intended idiomatic meaning in German. "Pfiff" (whistle) is a mistranslation of "pick" (candidate/selection) in this context, violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by changing the meaning completely from selecting someone to making a sound, hence "Pfiff" needs to be replaced with "Kandidaten" (candidate).
chief → Hauptrichter → oberste  	District → Bezirk → District  		**Explanation:** The word "Hauptrichter" (head judge) does not accurately convey the intended status of "chief judge", which refers to the highest-ranking judge within a court, aligning with the reference translation "oberste". "Bezirk" (district) improperly translates the specific "District of Columbia", which is a proper noun and should remain unchanged as in the reference translation.
minions → Minen → Lakaien  	enablers → Möglichkeiten → Helfershelfer  		**Explanation:** "Minen" (mines) is a mistranslation of "minions", which are subservient followers and not explosive devices. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "Minen" is completely out of context. "Möglichkeiten" (possibilities) is a mistranslation of "enablers", which means people who make something possible or easier. This significantly changes the intended meaning, highlighting a violation of the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump." In German, "Trumpf" literally means "trump card" and is not the name of the individual, Donald Trump. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as improper naming alters the meaning significantly in a political context.
treats → Verträge → Treats  	nude → Nuklearkalender → Nacktkalendar  	for 'women, as well as men' → für "Frauen". → für "Frauen und für Männer"		**Explanation:** "Verträge" (contracts) is a mistranslation of "treats", which doesn't make sense in this context, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Nuklearkalender" (nuclear calendar) is a typo or incorrect translation of "nude calendar", critically changing the meaning. The phrase "für 'Frauen'." (for "women") is missing the mention of "as well as men", which significantly alters the intended inclusive message.
Treats → Trägermagazin → Treats  	launch → starten → herauszubringen  	1970s' → in den 70er Jahren → 1970er Jahre  		**Explanation:** "Trägermagazin" (carrier magazine) is a mistranslation of "Treats", which should be kept as a proper noun and not translated. "starten" (start) does not accurately capture the intended meaning of "launch" in this context, which is better rendered as "herauszubringen" (bring out). "in den 70er Jahren" (in the 70s) does not fit the intended meaning of "1970s'" which is used as an adjective describing the calendar, altering the timeline reference intended. The correct form, "1970er Jahre", keeps the original meaning intact as an attributive adjective.
famous → Nacken → nackter  	top → Spitzenmodellen → Topmodels  	calendar → Zeitkalender → Kalendar  	Muses → Muss → Muses  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Nacken" (necks) is a mistranslation for "naked" (nackter), violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "famous naked people" is central to the meaning.	2. "Spitzenmodellen" translates as "top models" in a general sense, but here it distorts the specific branding term "Topmodels", which aligns more closely with the intended meaning.	3. "Zeitkalender" (time calendar) incorrectly translates the straightforward "calendar" to "Kalendar", which conforms to the usual German spelling, preserving the meaning and function.	4. "Muss" is a clear mistranslation of "Muses", which is a specific brand in this context, significantly altering the meaning.
president → Bundespräsident → Chefredakteur  	nude-heavy → engstirnige → Nackt  	old-school → Altschulen → Oldschool  		**Explanation:** "Bundespräsident" (Federal President) is a mistranslation of "president" referring to the specific role of Steve Shaw as editor, not a head of state, whereas "Chefredakteur" (editor-in-chief) accurately reflects his role. "Engstirnige" (narrow-minded) is a mistranslation of "nude-heavy", referring to the magazine's content focus, not an attitude. "Altschulen" (old schools) is a mistranslation of "old-school", which refers to an old style or tradition rather than actual educational institutions. These changes significantly alter the meaning and context of the original sentence, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The difference between "tue" and "mache" is an acceptable variation in this context. Both "tue" and "mache" can be translated as "do" in English and maintain the intended meaning of the sentence, following the **Ignore acceptable variations** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While the candidate translation uses "Offenbar" and "meint" instead of "Anscheinend" and "ist der Ansicht," both are synonymous and retain their intended meaning in German. The phrase structure in the candidate sentence is simplified but reflects the essential meaning of the source sentence. Thus, considering the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, there are no significant single-word translation errors that change the meaning.
(need → Zeit nehmen → müssen)  	(showcasing → Nuancen zeigen → zur Darstellung)  	(nudity → Nuancen → Nackheit)  	(calendar → Tagungskalender → Kalendars)  		**Explanation:** 	- "Zeit nehmen" (take time) is a mistranslation of "need", affecting the intended urgency of the sentence.	- "Nuancen zeigen" (show nuances) does not accurately convey "showcasing", which refers more to a display or presentation, crucial for the context.	- "Nuancen" (nuances) is an erroneous translation of "nudity", significantly changing the subject matter.	- "Tagungskalender" (conference calendar) is not appropriate for the context compared to "Kalendars", which preserves the original meaning of calendar release.
art → Kunststück → Kunstwerk		**Explanation:** "Kunststück" (trick or stunt) is a mistranslation of "art". The term "Kunstwerk" (artwork) better fits the context of a "beautiful piece of art", as it captures the artistic value intended by the source sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Kunststück" does not accurately reflect the artistic nature described.
pics → Piks → Bilder		**Explanation:** "Piks" is a mistranslation of "pics," as the correct German word is "Bilder." This is an error following the **Identify Mistranslations** rule, where the candidate word does not match the source or the reference.
Kurdish → kurdische → Kurdische  	community → Gemeinschaft → Gemeinde  	exodus → Massenexodus → Massenflucht  		**Explanation:**  	1. "kurdische" (lowercase) is a capitalization error when compared to "Kurdische" and refers to the community, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Gemeinschaft" (community) and "Gemeinde" (commune or community) are synonymous but "Gemeinde" is a closer match in this context, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	3. "Massenexodus" (mass exodus) translates more literally than "Massenflucht" (mass flight), but the latter is the preferred term in this context according to the reference translation, adhering to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
President → Präsident → Vorsitzender  		**Explanation:** "Präsident" (President) is a mistranslation of "chairman". The intended meaning in the reference translation uses "Vorsitzender" (chairman), not "Präsident". This is a significant role misidentification. "Gülenn-unterstützenden" (supporting Gülen) and "Gülen-nahen" (Gülen-aligned) differ, but are contextually closer and thus not prioritized over the role error.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation provides an accurate translation of the source sentence into German. Key elements such as "kurdische Gemeinschaft" (Kurdish community), "Zehntausenden von Menschen" (tens of thousands of people), "kurzfristig" (at short notice), "Schutz" (protection), and the action of people "fliehen" (fleeing) from "Türkei" (Turkey) to "Deutschland" (Germany) are appropriately conveyed. The differences between the candidate and reference translations are stylistic rather than meaningful errors, thus conforming to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both the candidate and the reference sentences convey the intended meaning of the source sentence accurately in German. They use slightly different structures and synonyms, but these variations are acceptable and do not change the overall meaning. The **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules apply here, as the candidate translation "Mitfelfristig könnte dies sogar zu 'einigen Hunderttausend' werden, glaubt Ali Toprak, der Vorsitzende der Vereinigung" is a valid and contextually appropriate translation.
crackdown → Durchgriff → harten Vorgehens  	attempted coup → Staatsstreichversuch → Putschversuch  	the Germany Kurdish Association → den deutschen Kurdenverband → die Kurdische Gemeinde Deutschland		**Explanation:** 		- "Durchgriff" (intervention) is a mistranslation of "crackdown" (harten Vorgehens), which in German context specifically refers to a tough approach or stronger actions especially in legal or authoritative measures.	- "Staatsstreichversuch" (attempted overthrow) is a literal translation but "Putschversuch" is more commonly used in German to describe an attempted coup.	- "den deutschen Kurdenverband" (the German Kurdish Association) does not match "die Kurdische Gemeinde Deutschland," which is a specific name of the organisation involved, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
1. expecting → erwarte → rechne	2. antagonise → antagniert → bekämpft		**Explanation:** 	- "erwarte" (expect) is not an exact translation of "rechne" (reckon/anticipate), which is a more contextually accurate choice here. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "rechne" implies a calculation or estimation that "expect" might not fully capture.	- "antagniert" appears to be a mistranslation or malformed version of "antagonize". The correct translation should be "bekämpft" (fight/oppose), which affects the meaning concerning actions against minorities and opposition. This error violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, as it changes the meaning concerning the actions of the regime.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence when compared to the reference translation. Terms like "initiated punitive action" vs. "Strafmaßnahmen eingeleitet" and "are on the run" vs. "auf der Flucht" reflect the intended meaning without introducing significant errors, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Thus, no single-word translation errors are present.
unsuccessful → erfolglosen → vereitelten  	coup → Staatsstreich → Putsch  	added → gesetzt → hinzu  	ethnic → (missing) → ethnische  		**Explanation:**  	- "erfolglosen" (unsuccessful) is a mistranslation of "vereitelten" (thwarted), which changes the nuance of the coup's outcome.  	- "Staatsstreich" (coup d'etat) is a broader term compared to "Putsch" (putsch), leading to a difference in connotation.  	- "gesetzt" (set) does not fully capture the meaning of "added" in context, whereas "hinzu" (added) directly expresses the idea.  	- The word "ethnische" (ethnic) is missing in the candidate translation but is important for specifying the group of Turks being referred to.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While the sentence structures differ, the candidate translation conveys the intended meaning accurately. Both "wollen einen Neuanfang" and "neu anfangen wollen" communicate the idea of starting anew. Similarly, "weiterhin unter der Unterdrückung leiden" and "weiter unterdrückt werden" both effectively express the concept of experiencing oppression. Thus, no words in the candidate sentence represent clear translation errors based on the given rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although there are minor differences in phrasing between the candidate and the reference, such as "Land" vs. "Staat" or "inakzeptabel" vs. "kann nicht sein", these are acceptable variations or stylistic choices that do not significantly alter the meaning. Therefore, according to the instructions, no errors that significantly change the meaning are present.
head → Vorsitzende → Verbandschef  	deliberate → absichtliche → gezielte  	relocating → Verlegung → Ansiedlung  		**Explanation:** "Vorsitzende" (chairperson) is a mistranslation of "head," where "Verbandschef" (chief of the association) is more contextually appropriate, thereby aligning with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "absichtliche" (deliberate) is a less precise translation compared to "gezielte" (targeted), changing the connotation slightly but significantly enough to notice. Lastly, "Verlegung" (transfer/relocation) is less specific than "Ansiedlung" (settlement), which is more aligned with the intended meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the correct meaning of the source sentence, even though it is worded differently than the reference translation. The core idea that Erdogan aimed to influence the remaining Kurds to leave is maintained, satisfying the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Additionally, no single words are mistranslated in a way that alters the sentence's meaning or context when evaluated individually, complying with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** criterion.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the meaning and details of the source and reference sentences. There are no single-word errors that significantly alter the meaning as per the provided instructions.
head → Vorsitzende → Verbandschef  	acted → vorging → positioniert  	harshly → hart → scharf  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Vorsitzende" (chairman) is a mistranslation of "head", where "Verbandschef" (head of association) provides more accurate context.	2. "vorging" (acted/took action) does not capture the nuance of "positioniert" (positioned), which in context refers to expressing or adopting a stance similar to, rather than merely acting like.	3. "hart" (hard) is a mistranslation of "harshly", where "scharf" (sharply) conveys the severe stance accurately.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon examining the translation, the candidate sentence conveys the intended meaning from the source sentence. It accurately represents the concept of a "witch-hunt" and translates the context and entities without significant errors. The differences between "Kritiker Erdogan" and "Erdogan-Kritiker" do not significantly alter the meaning. Therefore, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, no translation errors are detected.
no longer → zum ersten Mal → nicht mehr		**Explanation:** "zum ersten Mal" (for the first time) is incorrectly used in place of "no longer" (nicht mehr), which changes the intended meaning of the sentence. This error violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it improperly conveys the timeline and experience of feeling unsafe.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with both the source and reference sentences. The most significant words such as "Gülen movement" and "flee abroad" are correctly translated, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. While there are slight differences in the structure and phrasing, these do not constitute significant mistranslations and respect the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The translation maintains the intended meaning from the source sentence: "Weitere Türken" for "More Turks," "Asyl beantragen" for "seek asylum," and "insbesondere Kurden und Oppositionsmitglieder" for "especially Kurds and members of the opposition" are all correct and contextually appropriate. "Weitere" and "Mehr" are interchangeable in this context, and "Asyl suchen" and "Asyl beantragen" both convey the act of seeking asylum, while "Oppositionsmitglieder" and "Oppositionelle" are synonymous here. Therefore, no words are demonstrably incorrect or altering the intended meaning.
Gülen-supporter → Günlen-Fans → Gülen-Anhänger		**Explanation:** "Günlen-Fans" is a mistranslation of "Gülen-supporter." In the candidate translation, the term "Fans" does not accurately convey the same meaning as "Anhängerschaft" or "supporters," as it implies a less serious or different type of association. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it changes the intended message regarding the perceived severity of being labeled in this way. Moreover, the word "Günlen" seems to be a typing error for "Gülen," which is critical in this context.
1. suitcase → Koffer → Koffern		**Explanation:** "Koffern" (suitcases) in the reference indicates more than one suitcase; "Koffer" (suitcase) in the candidate is singular, which changes the meaning slightly and is considered a mistranslation under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. 		2. packed → gefüllt → gepackten		**Explanation:** "gepackten" (packed) in the reference indicates a different state than "gefüllt" (filled) in the candidate. This changes the context significantly, as it implies readiness to leave, rather than merely the condition of being filled, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
reports → Zeitungsmeldungen → Zeitung  	coup → Staatsstreich → Putsch  	granted → gewährt hat → anerkannten  	largest group → größte Gruppe, die ... kam → größte Gruppe der  		**Explanation:**  	- "reports" is mistranslated as "Zeitungsmeldungen" (newspaper reports) instead of the singular "Zeitung" (newspaper), which changes the intended meaning as it's about a specific report.  	- "coup" is mistranslated as "Staatsstreich" which can be considered outdated or more literary; "Putsch" is more standard in contemporary German.  	- "granted" is mistranslated as "gewährt hat" (has granted) changing the meaning; the correct context is "anerkannten" (recognized or acknowledged).  	- The phrase "largest group" in the candidate translation distorts the intended meaning due to incorrect grammatical structure and word order. It reads as if the 'Turks' granted asylum, which is reversed. Correct translation clarifies that Turks formed the largest group receiving asylum ("größte Gruppe der").
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate and reference translations convey the same meaning. While there are differences in wording and style, no single word significantly changes or misconstrues the intended message of the source sentence. Thus, in accordance with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, no mistranslations that affect comprehension are present.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the meaning of the source sentence. Both "Zu diesen Zahlen gehören keine" and "In dieser Erhebung finden sich nicht" correctly convey the idea that those figures do not include the specific group of people mentioned. Similarly, the list of reasons "Krieg, Armut oder Perspektivlosigkeit" is translated consistently. No single-word translation errors significantly alter the meaning.
individuals → Menschen → individuell		**Explanation:** The term "individuals" is specifically translated as "individuell" in the reference to emphasize that the persecution must be targeted at individuals. The candidate translation uses "Menschen" (people), which is less specific and contextually alters the meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Although "Geht dort, wo es schmerzt" and "Dahin gehen, wo es wehtut" differ slightly in phrasing, both translate to "Go where it hurts" in context. There is no significant change in meaning, and therefore no single-word errors to report.
locals → man → Einheimischen  	state → staatliche → Landtag  		**Explanation:** "man" (one) does not correctly translate "locals". The candidate sentence uses a generic term instead of specifying the local population, which changes the meaning and violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "staatliche" (state) mistranslates "Landtag" (state parliament), changing the intended meaning, per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "haben sie das verstanden" and the reference translation "haben sie verstanden" both convey the meaning of the source sentence accurately. The inclusion of "das" (this) in the candidate does not alter the intended meaning significantly enough to be considered an error, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
parliament → Parlamentswahlen → Landtagswahl  	state → Parlamentswahlen → Landtagswahl  		**Explanation:** The term "Landtagswahl" translates more directly to "state parliament elections" or "state election". In the candidate translation, "Parlamentswahlen" typically refers to general or parliamentary elections and does not capture the specific reference to "state" parliament elections as "Landtagswahl" does. This significantly alters the meaning, warranting identification as a **Meaningful Error** according to the task instructions.
was → waren → geht  	clash → kollidieren → beißt  		**Explanation:** 	- "waren" (were) is a mistranslation of "was," which inaccurately changes the sentence structure and violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule where "was" refers to a singular collective experience rather than plural things.	- "kollidieren" (collide) is a mistranslation of "clash," which, although relevant, is less fitting metaphorically than "beißen" (bite), which captures the intended idiomatic expression more accurately per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
locals → Orte → Einheimischen  	candidates → Kandidaten → Wahlkämpfern  		**Explanation:** "Orte" (places) is a mistranslation of "locals", as the sentence contextually refers to people, not locations. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Kandidaten" (candidates) does not capture the specific notion of "Wahlkämpfern" (campaigners), which is a more contextually accurate translation given the election-related content.
Most → meisten → allermeisten  	state → Staat → Land  	Usedom → Ussee → Usedom  	vote → stimmen → wählen  		**Explanation:**		- "Meisten" (most) is a correct translation of "most", but "allermeisten" (the great majority) is a more contextually accurate translation given the emphasis in the reference sentence, thus making it a notable difference.	- "Staat" (state) is incorrect. "Land" is more appropriate in this context as it refers to a federal state in Germany, and this follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Ussee" (not a valid word) seems to be a typographical error for "Usedom", which significantly affects the accuracy in terms of geographical reference.	- "Stimmen" (vote) is a mistranslation in context; "wählen" is more specifically about voting in elections or for a parliament, aligning with **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.
signs → Schilder → Plakate  	blow up → sprengen → aufblasen  	flyers → Flüger → Flyer  		**Explanation:**  	- "Schilder" is a mistranslation of "signs" into "Plakate" (which means posters) in the context of the task described. The reference translation captures the correct term as per the usual understanding of event preparation.	- "sprengen" means "to blow up" in the sense of destruction, while the correct translation in this context is "aufblasen" (inflate), referring to balloons.	- "Flüger" is not a recognized German word for "flyers." The correct translation should be "Flyer" as indicated in the reference.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely mirrors the structure and key terms from the source and includes accurate German equivalents that retain the intended meanings. Differences in the phrase "eine weitere Wahl ertragen" (put up with one more election) compared to the reference's "einmal noch Wahlkampf" (one more election campaign) do not introduce significant errors within the context, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
heated → aufgeheizte → heiße		**Explanation:** "aufgeheizte" (heated) is a mistranslation of "heated". While "aufgeheizte" would be understandable, "heiße" (hot) is more contextually appropriate in this sentence structure, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Sellering → Seller → Sellering  	something → etwas → um  	seat → Sitz → Amt  		**Explanation:** "Seller" is a mistranslation of "Sellering," which changes the proper noun and must be corrected for accuracy, addressing the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The translation of "something" as "etwas" is literal but does not convey the emphasis present in the source sentence, which is better captured by "um" in this context, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "Sitz" (seat) is less appropriate here than "Amt" (office/position), which conveys the political context correctly within this sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the same meaning as both the source and reference translations. Although there are differences in expression, such as "steht laut Umfragen jetzt eindeutig" versus "liegt nun in Umfragen klar," these are acceptable variations that do not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence. Hence, there are no mistranslations based on the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
formed → gebildet → übrig		**Explanation:** In this context, "gebildet" (formed) in the candidate sentence is a mistranslation compared to "übrig bleibt" (remains) in the reference. The error lies in the change of the intended outcome of the coalition discussion. The reference suggests examining what remains coalition-worthy rather than the specific act of forming one, which is a violation of the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Sellering → Verkauf → Sellering  	inconspicuous → unsichtbaren → unauffällig  		**Explanation:** "Verkauf" (sale) is a mistranslation of "Sellering", which is a name and should remain unchanged. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "Verkauf" alters the subject of the sentence in a significant way. "Unsichtbaren" (invisible) is a mistranslation of "inconspicuous", which changes the intended meaning of the campaign's nature. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it implies the campaign was not seen at all rather than not being attention-grabbing.
chatting → tauscht → plauscht  	legendarily taciturn → klammheimlicher → legendär wortkarger  		**Explanation:** "tauscht" (exchanges) is a mistranslation of "chatting"; it changes the intended activity from communicating to exchanging. "klammheimlicher" (surreptitious) is a mistranslation of "legendarily taciturn," which refers to being famously reserved in speech. These mistranslations significantly alter the intended meanings in the sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both the candidate and reference translations accurately convey the meaning of the source sentence. The variation in words for "apart from that" as "darüber hinaus" and "ansonsten" are acceptable variations that do not change the overall meaning. Similarly, "Chancellor Merkel" translated as "Bundeskanzlerin Merkel" and "Kanzlerin Merkel" are both correct and contextually appropriate. The actions described, "has got cold feet" and "blaming for the rise," are also accurately translated in both versions. Therefore, there are no significant meaning-changing translation errors.
far-right → extremen Rechten → Rechtspopulisten  		**Explanation:** "extremen Rechten" (extreme right) is a mistranslation of "far-right" compared to how it's conceptualized in the context of "Rechtspopulisten" (right-wing populists). The reference emphasizes "Rechtspopulisten", which refers more specifically to political entities rather than the generic notion of extremism. This inaccuracy violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
CDU → CDU → CDU  	top-level candidate → Spitzenkandidatin → Spitzenkandidaten  	Minister of the Interior → Innenminister → Innenminister  	Lorenz Caffier → Lenz Caffer → Lorenz Caffier  	has → haben → hat  	fight an election → eine Wahl führt → Wahlkampf macht  	right place → an der richtigen Stelle → am richtigen Ort  		**Explanation:** 	- "Spitzenkandidatin" (female candidate) is a mistranslation of "top-level candidate" which should be "Spitzenkandidaten" (male candidate) since Lorenz Caffier is male.	- "Lenz Caffer" is likely a typo or mistranslation of "Lorenz Caffier."	- "haben" is the plural verb form, while "hat" is the correct singular form matching the singular subject "CDU und ihr Spitzenkandidat."	- "eine Wahl führt" (conduct an election) changes the intended meaning of "fight an election," which is better captured by "Wahlkampf macht" (campaigning).	- "an der richtigen Stelle" (at the right position) does not capture the idiomatic meaning of "right place," which is better translated as "am richtigen Ort."
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence. It correctly translates key elements such as "the CDU," "Chancellor Angela Merkel," "two mass rallies," and "Merkel's parliamentary constituency is in the north-east." Comparing with the reference translation, there are no significant differences in meaning that necessitate reporting any single-word translation errors.
There → Es → da		**Explanation:** "Es" (it) is a mistranslation of "there", as used in the context of this sentence. The correct term to imply the presence or existence of something is "da", which the reference translation uses. This discrepancy changes the structure and somewhat the meaning of the sentence, thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
majority → Mehrheit → Mehrheit  	federal states → Bundesstaaten → Bundesländern  	complained → hat sich beschwert → klagte  	to → bei → im  		**Explanation:**		- "Bundesstaaten" (states) is a mistranslation of "federal states" when referring in German to "other federal states" within Germany, which is more accurately conveyed as "Bundesländern." This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule where the key term is the jurisdictional division.	  	- "hat sich beschwert" is a mistranslation of "complained." Although both terms imply discontent, "klagte" is a more direct translation that fits better in this context, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		- "bei" is a mistranslation of "to" in this context. While "bei" can mean "at" or "with," the context of making a complaint calls for "im" to convey the idea of addressing it "to" an organization, respecting the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the meaning of the source sentence, with no significant alteration in context or meaning when compared to the reference translation. The variations in word choice, such as "geschadet" for "schaden" and "Teilen" for "Ecken," do not significantly change the meaning and are acceptable variations. Thus, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, no translation errors are reported.
northeast → Nordosten → Nordost  	dispensing with → gibt es → verzichtet auf  	normal → normalen → üblichen  		**Explanation:**  	1. **northeast → Nordosten → Nordost**: "Nordosten" translates literally to "northeast", while "Nordost" is used nominally to specifically refer to the regional CDU.  	2. **dispensing with → gibt es → verzichtet auf**: "gibt es" means "there is/are", which does not convey the sense of "dispensing with" (essentially "doing without") used in the source. The intended meaning is closest to "verzichtet auf" (to dispense with).  	3. **normal → normalen → üblichen**: "normalen" translates to "normal", which can be technically correct but contextually weaker than "üblichen" (usual/customary), which better matches the reference sentence's intended interpretation of "normal".   		These corrections are made following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, identifying critical mistranslations that affect contextual understanding.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "kleine Rolle" (small role) adequately captures the meaning of "minor role". Although there is a slight variation between the reference "untergeordnete Rolle" (subordinate role) and "kleine Rolle", this is an acceptable synonym that conveys the intended meaning without altering the context significantly. Hence, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no error is reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "festgestellt" and "gemerkt" convey noticing or realizing, "an Boden verlieren" and "die Basis wegbröselt" both describe losing ground or footing in a region, and "hart arbeiten müssen, um Kontakt herzustellen" and "sich sehr anstrengen muss, wieder einen Draht zu finden" both imply making efforts to connect with people. Although there are different word choices, none significantly alter the meaning, thus complying with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning and structure of the source sentence. "suffering" is translated as "leiden", which matches the context and meaning. The phrase "hardly present across large swathes of the region" is appropriately translated to "kaum in weiten Teilen der Region". Although there are differences in structure and phrasing compared to the reference translation, such as "Region" versus "Landes", the key meaning is preserved, which follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Therefore, no single-word errors are reported.
advice → Rat → Rat  	candidate → Kandidat → Wahlkämpfer  	hurts → verletzt → wehtut  	village → Dorffets → Dorffeste  	Golden Wedding anniversaries → Golden Wedding Jubiläum → Goldene Hochzeiten  	every birthday party → jeder Geburtstag → jede Geburtstagsfeier  		**Explanation:**  	- "advice" is correctly translated as "Rat", so this is not an error.	- "candidate" translated as "Kandidat" is not technically wrong, but doesn't fully capture the role in a campaign context compared to "Wahlkämpfer". However, contextually it fits, so no error is flagged here.	- "hurts" should be "wehtut" rather than "verletzt", as "wehtut" maintains the idiomatic expression used in the source, fulfilling the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "village fetes" should be "Dorffeste" and not the incorrectly coined term "Dorffets".	- "Golden Wedding anniversaries" should be translated as "Goldene Hochzeiten" not "Golden Wedding Jubiläum". The direct borrowing "Golden Wedding" is unnecessary and non-standard in this context.	- "every birthday party" should be "jede Geburtstagsfeier" rather than the overly literal "jeder Geburtstag", following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule for proper idiomatic expression.
Sellering → Verkäufe → Sellering  	called → bezeichnet → aufgerufen  	election campaign → Wahlen → Wahlkampf  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon comparing the candidate and reference translations, the words in the candidate translation convey the meaning from the source sentence accurately. While there may be variations in phrasing, they do not significantly alter the meaning or context of the sentence. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where no errors are reported if the core meaning is preserved.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. Any minor differences in wording are acceptable variations that do not significantly alter the meaning, thus adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules. Both "Bei den Wahlen 2011" and "Bei der Wahl 2011" provide suitable translations for "In the 2011 elections," and the percentages and comparison between parties are correctly maintained.
percent → Wahlbeteiligung → Prozent		**Explanation:** "Wahlbeteiligung" translates to "voter turnout" in English, which changes the context and meaning from "seven percent in the polls" to something misleading about participation. The correct word for "percent" should remain as "Prozent".
holiday → Urlaubsfrage → Ferien-Not  	waging → führen → verlegen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Urlaubsfrage" (vacation question) is a mistranslation of "holiday issue". The reference uses "Ferien-Not" (holiday need/distress), which suggests a more pressing matter than just a question.	- "führen" (lead/conduct) is a mistranslation of "waging" in the context of an election campaign. The reference uses "verlegen" (relocate), indicating a shift predominantly to an online medium, which better captures the intended nuance.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation ["Online-Wahlkampf" ist das, was die regionale Vorsitzende Claudia Müller genannt hat] conveys the same meaning as the source sentence, using different but acceptable structures and vocabulary. The phrase "regionale Vorsitzende" translates to "regional chairperson," and retains the correct meaning in context. Similarly, "genannt hat" and "nennt es" both capture the act of naming or dubbing without altering the intended message, consistent with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Greens → Grünen → grüne  	searching out → suchen → auf Spurensuche  	local → vor Ort → einheimischen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Grünen" (Greens) is a general term but "grüne" (green) in this context specifically refers to the political party, aligning with the reference which conveys "Wahlkämpfer" (campaigners) representing the Greens.	2. "suchen" (search) does not capture the full nuance of "searching out" which is translated as "auf Spurensuche" (going on a trail/search) in the reference, which implies a more active and investigative search rather than simply looking.	3. "vor Ort" (local) suggests "on-site", while "einheimischen" (native) refers to locals in the context of voters, which is the intended meaning according to the reference.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** While there are differences in the sentences, such as "überquert" vs. "kurvt gerade mit" and "nette Zeit" vs. "schön," these differences are acceptable variations in German language translation and do not significantly alter the original meaning, satisfying the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. The candidate sentence maintains the intended meaning of the source.
view → Standpunkt → Eindruck  	election → Urlaub → Wahlurlaub  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Standpunkt" (standpoint) is a mistranslation of "view" which in this context is better expressed as "Eindruck" (impression/idea). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it does not fully capture the intended meaning.	2. "Urlaub" (holiday) is a mistranslation of "election holiday", which should be "Wahlurlaub" to accurately reflect the specific context of an election-related holiday. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it omits the election context.
restaurants → Restaurants → Gaststätten  	closure → Schließung → Sperrung  		**Explanation:** "Restaurants" is a literal translation but the reference uses "Gaststätten," which can be a broader term encompassing various types of dining places. However, given potential contextual overlap, this isn't the most critical error. The more meaningful mistranslation is "Schließung" (closure), which differs from "Sperrung" (blocking), a more contextually accurate reference given the nature of "B27 redevelopment" affecting transport and access rather than a full shutdown. Hence, both words are listed to encompass the nuanced context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both the candidate and reference translations express the lack of problems concerning the speed of redevelopment of the B27. The differences in word choice ("neu entwickelt" vs. "saniert") and structure do not significantly alter the meaning, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. The main contextual information is retained in both translations, thus, no errors are reported.
5.30 → 17.30 → 5.30  	all → Alle → allenthalben  		**Explanation:** The number "5.30" was mistranslated as "17.30," which significantly alters the meaning by changing the start time of the construction works. The candidate's "Alle" (all) does not convey the more spread-out sense of "allenthalben" (from all quarters), altering the scope of the praise mentioned in the source and reference sentences.
(They → Sie → Die)  	(explains → erklärt → erzählt)  	(Texlaff → Texlaff → Tetzlaff)  	(petrol station → Tanker → Tankstelle)  		**Explanation:**		1. "They" is translated as "Sie" in the candidate but as "Die" in the reference. In this context, "Die" is a colloquial way to refer to "they," matching the reference more closely.	2. "explains" is translated as "erklärt" in the candidate whereas "erzählt" is used in the reference. "erzählt" aligns better with the conversational tone in the reference.	3. "Texlaff" is a mistranscription of "Tetzlaff," as this is the correct name according to the reference.	4. "petrol station" is translated as "Tanker" in the candidate, which means "tanker" in English and is contextually incorrect. The reference uses "Tankstelle," which accurately means "petrol station."
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In German, "Verzögerungen" and "Verzug" both correctly translate to "delays" in this context. The meaning of the sentence remains intact, and there is no significant change in meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
start → Anfang → Wochenanfang  	half-way → Mittelweg → Halbzeit  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Anfang" (beginning) is a mistranslation of "start," which in this context refers to the start of the week, "Wochenanfang" (beginning of the week). This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it incorrectly defines the temporal context.	2. "Mittelweg" (middle way) is a mistranslation of "half-way," which should denote "Halbzeit" (half-time), referring to the halfway point in a sequence or process. The translation significantly alters the meaning of the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
obligingness → Verpflichtung → Entgegenkommen
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation adequately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While there are different word choices between the candidate and reference translations, such as "verlegt" vs. "gewandert", both are acceptable in context, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Additionally, "Aspegstraße" is correctly translated, and the improvements in the traffic situation are accurately depicted for both "Verkehrssituation" and "Verkehrslage". As all contextual meanings are preserved, there are no significant single-word translation errors to report.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the meaning of the source sentence accurately. Both "Bewohner" and "Bürger" are acceptable translations for "Residents". The structure and meaning of the candidate sentence are in line with the source, thereby adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate translation, while semantically different from the reference, captures the essence of the source sentence. Both translations convey the idea of fewer drivers using alternative routes or traffic decreasing in a town setting. This is explained by the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, where different valid expressions can convey similar meanings without constituting translation errors.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation adequately conveys the meaning of the source sentence despite differences in structure and some word choices. Words and phrases such as "ernste Beschwerden" for "serious complaints," "stellvertretender Chefoffizier" for "deputy chief officer," and "Verkehrsmanagement während der Umstrukturierung" for "traffic management during the redevelopment" are reasonable translations that preserve the core meaning without introducing significant errors. Hence, no translation errors were identified as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
(Bachsatzstraße → Bachtzstraße → Bachsatzstraße)  	(Residents → Einwohner → Anwohner)  	(satnav → Satnav → Navi)  	(signage → Signal → Beschilderung)  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Bachsatzstraße" is mistranslated as "Bachtzstraße". This is a significant detail mismatch, focusing on correctness in naming proper nouns.	2. "Residents" is mistranslated as "Einwohner". "Anwohner" aligns better contextually since it refers specifically to residents of a specific area or street, which fits the context.	3. "satnav" is translated as "Satnav". The more common term in German is "Navi", making "Satnav" an erroneous choice in this context.	4. "signage" is mistranslated as "Signal". The correct term is "Beschilderung" as it refers to road signs in the context of the sentence.
lorries → Lkw → Lkw  	hurtling → gehen → verfranste  		**Explanation:**  	- "Lkw" is already the correct translation for "lorries", but it is needed in the context of the sentence.	- "gehen" (go) is a mistranslation of "hurtling". "Verfranste" captures the unintended or chaotic movement implied by "hurtling through".		So, while the translation for "lorries" was initially a red herring, the real issue was with the verb describing their movement, highlighting the need for attention to **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While the structure of the candidate and reference translations differ, all individual words in the candidate translation accurately convey the meaning of the source sentence. The main concepts such as "commune," "increased calls," "measuring vehicle from Mössingen," and "speed limits were not adhered to" are correctly translated. Therefore, this adheres to the rules for handling acceptable variations and ensuring contextual accuracy.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation is semantically equivalent to the source. "Verstöße" fits the meaning of "infringements" and is used correctly in context. Other words are translated accurately or have near-equivalent meanings in both candidate and reference sentences. Although there is a slight change in the tense and wording (e.g., "sagte" vs. "sagt"), this does not constitute a significant error, thus respecting the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
two → Jede → Zwei  	every → Jede → pro  		**Explanation:** "Jede" (each/every) is a mistranslation of "two", altering the meaning to 'every minute'. "Jede" additionally replaces the intended "every" with an unnecessary duplication of 'every' since "pro" (per) can convey 'every minute' adequately. These substitutions violate the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule and do not accurately reflect the meaning of the source sentence.
fastest → schnellsten → Schnellste  	was → fahren → war  		**Explanation:** "schnellsten" (fastest, plural) is a mistranslation of "fastest" (singular, "Schnellste"), which affects the number and identity of the subject. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it changes who is being described. "fahren" (drive/are driving, present, plural) is a mistranslation of "was" (past, "war"), changing the tense and subject number, which is a **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule violation as it impacts the meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation, "Voranschreiten der Baustelle" (progress of the construction site) is an acceptable interpretation of "construction site has moved on," and "haben sich die Dinge beruhigt" (things have quietened down) conveys the intended meaning well. There are no significant single-word errors in the candidate sentence that alter the intended meaning, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the overall meaning of the source sentence, with no significant single-word mistranslations. The structure and phrasing may differ slightly, but all key concepts are accurately translated.
show → zeigen → schauen lassen		**Explanation:** "zeigen" (to show) is incorrectly translated as "schauen lassen" (not to allow looking in), which significantly alters the meaning in the context of the idiomatic expression "to show their hand". This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it changes the context of strategic secrecy implied in the original sentence.
**(questioned → in Frage stellen → fragt)**		**Explanation:** The candidate word "in Frage stellen" (to question or challenge) is a mistranslation of "questioned" in this context. The reference translation uses "fragt" (asked), which is consistent with questioning in the context, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Einige sind jedoch stärker betroffen als andere." captures the meaning of the source sentence correctly. The variations in wording such as "Einige" for "some" and "stärker betroffen" for "affected more" are valid in this context, and the sentence structure conveys the intended message. There are no significant single-word errors that change the meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although the candidate and reference translations use different structures and words, both translations accurately convey the meaning of the source sentence. The candidate translation uses "Umstrukturierung" for "redevelopment" and "Sanierung" for "redevelopment", both of which can appropriately reflect restructuring and redevelopment in this context. Therefore, there are no single-word translation errors that significantly change the meaning, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
passing trade → passivem Handel → Laufkundschaft		**Explanation:** "passivem Handel" (passive trade) is a mistranslation of "passing trade", which changes the intended meaning related to foot traffic or spontaneous customers. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it does not fit the intended meaning in context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation, there are no single-word mistranslations that significantly change the meaning when compared to the source and reference sentences. The key elements "Bars und Restaurants" (bars and restaurants) and "Straße" (road) remain consistent. The words "am härtesten betroffen" align with the intended meaning of "the hardest hit." Therefore, no significant single-word translation errors are present.
J. Albert Göhner → J. Albert Göger → J. Albert Göhner  	owner → Eigentümer → Inhaber  	clearly → klar ausgedrückt → deutliche Worte  		**Explanation:**  	- "J. Albert Göger" is a mistranslation of "J. Albert Göhner", altering the name significantly and violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.  	- "Eigentümer" (owner) and "Inhaber" (proprietor) have similar meanings, but "Inhaber" aligns more directly with the reference translation, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.  	- "klar ausgedrückt" (expressed clearly) is a faithful representation of the source meaning but does not align with "findet deutliche Worte" (finds clear words), thus changing the tone. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by identifying "clearly" as the point of divergence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Sie bedroht unsere eigene Existenz" conveys the core idea of a threat to existence, which aligns with the source sentence. While the reference translation uses a different structure, both the candidate and the reference accurately reflect the source's intended meaning. Thus, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, the candidate translation is acceptable.
him → er → ihn  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "er" (he), which fails to convey the accusative case used in the source sentence's context, where "him" implies "ihn" being affected by something. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, changing the meaning subtly but significantly to a subject rather than an object.		restaurants → Restaurants → Gaststätten  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Restaurants", while "Gaststätten" is used in the reference. Although "Restaurants" and "Gaststätten" can often be interchangeable, in this specific sentence context where a more generalized reference is implied, "Gaststätten" may encompass a broader range of dining establishments than "Restaurants". This difference can be significant in certain contexts, thus following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule to err on the side of identifying subtle but potentially important distinctions in meaning.
Customers → Zöller → Kunden  		**Explanation:** "Zöller" (customs officers) is a mistranslation of "customers" (Kunden), which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it alters the identity of the group staying away.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence, even though there is a difference in wording between the candidate and the reference translations. The phrase "jeden Euro Gewinn" (every euro of profit) is a correct translation of "every euro of profit," and the structure of the sentence is appropriate in German. There are no significant single-word translation errors that change the meaning of the original sentence, and no rule violations are evident.
profits → Gewinne → Umsatzeinbußen		slumped → zunichte gemacht werden → beziffert		**Explanation:** 		1. "Gewinne" (profits) should be translated as "Umsatzeinbußen" (losses), as the reference translation specifies that it's the declines/stagnation in sales being quantified, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	   	2. The phrase "slumped" is translated as "zunichte gemacht werden" (became null/void), which inaccurately reflects the intended meaning of quantifying a decline. The correct reference word is "beziffert" (quantifies), which aligns with **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by clarifying the meaning of how large the reduction is.
road redevelopment → Straßenverlagerung → Straßensanierung  	businesses → Unternehmen → Betrieb  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Straßenverlagerung" (road relocation) is a mistranslation of "road redevelopment", since it changes the context from improving a road to moving it. This directly impacts the sentence meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	  	2. "Unternehmen" (businesses) is mistranslated when the context indicates a singular impact, corresponding to "Betrieb" (business/operation) in the reference. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the focus is on a singular entity that is affected.
half → abwandern → entlassen  		**Explanation:** "abwandern" (migrate) is a mistranslation of "let go" which in this context means "entlassen" (dismiss). This significantly alters the meaning because "abwandern" implies voluntary leaving rather than being laid off, thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although there are differences in the candidate and reference translations, none of them represent a significant change in the meaning of the sentence. "Unternehmen" and "Firma" both translate to "company" in English. "Beschäftigten" and "Mitarbeitern" both translate to "employees." The expressions for "letting go" also convey the same meaning, and the differences in other parts do not constitute meaningful errors. Thus, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, there are no translation errors present.
Göhner → Göger → Göhner	government's president → Regierungschef → Regierungspräsident	compensation → Entschädigung → Ausgleich	redevelopment → Umstrukturierung → Sanierung		**Explanation:**	- "Göhner" was incorrectly translated as "Göger," altering the person's name. This is an error under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "government's president" (Refers to the position/title of Jörg Schmidt) should be "Regierungspräsident" not "Regierungschef." This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "financial compensation" ("Entschädigung") should be "financial Ausgleich," according to the reference translation which closely fits this context.	- "redevelopment" was mistranslated as "Umstrukturierung" instead of "Sanierung," changing the meaning in this context, thus violating **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.
Göhner → Ältere → Göhner  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Ältere" (elderly), which is a mistranslation of "Göhner", a proper noun, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it completely changes the subject of the sentence. The rest of the sentence has similar meaning and does not contain words that significantly alter the meaning compared to the source and reference sentences.
Göhner → Göger → Göhner  	complains → Beschwerden → Klagen  		**Explanation:** "Göger" is a mistranslation of "Göhner," which is a proper name and should remain consistent. The word "Beschwerden" (complaints) is used in the candidate translation, while the source and reference recognize the context of "Klagen" (legal complaints or suits), indicating a significant meaning change. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by failing to correctly convey the nature of the complaints.
family business → Familienunternehmen → Familienbetrieb  	moved → beförderte sich → angesiedelt  		**Explanation:** "Familienunternehmen" and "Familienbetrieb" are synonyms, but "Familienbetrieb" is more contextually appropriate and specific in this historical context. The key error lies in "beförderte sich" (promoted itself), which is a mistranslation of "moved". "Beförderte sich" significantly changes the meaning intended in the context of relocation, not promotion. The correct word would be "angesiedelt" (settled/located).
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence in the German language. There are no significant single-word translation errors that change the intended meaning. The usage of words like "regulären Kunden" for "regular customers" and "komplizierten Verkehrssystems" for "complicated traffic system" fits the context. Therefore, this follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
drive → verfahren → herfahren  	past → nicht → woanders  		**Explanation:**  	- "verfahren" is a mistranslation of "drive past." "Herfahren" (get here/drive here) is more accurate, whereas "verfahren" suggests getting lost or misplaced.	- "nicht" (not) does not accurately convey the sense of "past" in context; the phrase refers to going "elsewhere" rather than being simply unable to drive. The reference "woanders" (elsewhere) captures the intended comparison of the locations.
1. Göhner → Göger → Göhner	2. regulars → Register → Stammklientel		**Explanation:** "Göger" is a mistranslation of "Göhner," which could lead to confusion about who is being referenced. "Register" is a mistranslation of "regulars," which refers to regular customers or clientele. The incorrect translation affects the accurate understanding of the customer's relationship to Göhner.
Göhner → Gärner → Göhner  	works → B 27 → B 27-Bauarbeiten  	clientele → Klientel → Kundschaft  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Gärner" is a mistranslation of "Göhner", as the name should remain consistent with the source and reference. This is a direct violation of the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, specifically regarding proper nouns.	2. The term "B 27" alone is a mistranslation of "B 27 works" as it omits the specific mention of "Bauarbeiten" (construction works), changing the meaning. This is adjusted due to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it conveys the major cause of the crisis.	3. "Klientel" is a mistranslation of "clientele", but "Kundschaft" (customers) is more contextually accurate in this reference. The chosen words must fit the context as seen in the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Sechs Monate Bauarbeiten, das ist brutal." closely mirrors the meaning of the source sentence. The reference translation adds "schon" for emphasis ("definitely brutal"), but the omission does not significantly alter the sentence's meaning. Thus, no meaningfully significant mistranslation is present, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While "Gesetze verabschiedet" (passed laws) and "an Gesetzen geschraubt" (tweaked with laws) are not identical, they convey the intended action of changing or passing laws related to anti-terrorism measures. Both translations fit within the context, and the candidate translation does not contain a mistranslation that significantly alters the meaning compared to the source. This aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the core meaning effectively. While "eine Reihe von Sicherheitsmaßnahmen" (a host of security measures) and "ein dickes Sicherheitspaket" (a comprehensive security package) differ in wording, both translations communicate the introduction of security measures post-attacks. Therefore, there are no significant errors violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
residential → Aufenthaltsstatus → Duldungsstatus  	terrorism → Terrorismus → Terror  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Aufenthaltsstatus" (residence status) is close to "residential status" but the reference uses "Duldungsstatus" (toleration status), which can slightly differ in legal context. The translation diverges from the specific reference but maintains the context. However, it could potentially change the implications, so it's marked.  	2. "Terrorismus" is a broader term than "Terror," which specifically refers to "terror." The more general term "Terrorismus" might imply organized efforts or ideology, while "Terror" might reflect acts or experiences of fear.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Und was sagt der Koalitionspartner dazu?" effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence "And what does the coalition partner have to say about it all?" though it omits the explicit translation of "all" present in the reference ("zu all dem"). However, the meaning is preserved, and the translation is contextually accurate. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as there is no significant change in meaning.
conciliator → Vermittler → Versöhner		**Explanation:** "Vermittler" (mediator) is a mistranslation of "conciliator". While both roles involve conflict resolution, "Versöhner" (conciliator) specifically refers to bringing about reconciliation, which is the precise word in the source sentence. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules, highlighting the differing nuances in role depiction.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although the phrasing of the candidate and reference translation differs, the primary meaning remains intact and there is no single-word discrepancy that significantly changes the context. Both translations manage to convey the intended meaning of the original sentence, thus aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
not asking → verlangen → überfordern  		**Explanation:** "verlangen" (demand) is a mistranslation of "not asking" in this context. The intended meaning is more closely related to "überfordern" (overburden) or "asking too much", which differs significantly from simply "demanding" something. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the context of the expectations put on others.
Andere → Weitere → Andere  	issues → Fragen → Punkte  	within → in → innerhalb  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Andere" (other) is mistranslated as "Weitere" (further), which is a different understanding from the source phrase "other."	2. "issues" is mistranslated as "Fragen" (questions), whereas "Punkte" (points) would be a closer translation.	3. "within" is mistranslated as "in" (in), while "innerhalb" (within) is the accurate choice that maintains the original meaning contextually.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Ich werde mich auch daran beteiligen." effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence "I will also be involved in that." Both the candidate and reference translations accurately capture the involvement implied in the source sentence. No single-word errors that change meaning significantly are present. This complies with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as both sentences are valid translations.
results → Ergebnisse → Ergebnissen  	achievable → erreichbaren → erzielbaren  	agreement → Einigung → Konsens  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Ergebnisse" (results) is a direct translation but the reference uses "Ergebnissen," which aligns more with conveying interest and responsibility in ensuring outcomes, suggesting a deeper nuance.	2. "erreichbaren" (achievable) should be "erzielbaren" (achievable/result-driven), consistent with reaching an effective consensus rather than just any agreement.	3. "Einigung" (agreement) is a general term. However, "Konsens" (consensus) is the correct word as it implies a more collective understanding, crucial in coalition politics.
most → jüngsten → jüngsten  	recent → jüngsten → jüngsten  	pass → verstreicht → verstreichen  		**Explanation:** "most recent" should be translated as "jüngsten" which both the candidate and reference used correctly. However, there's a mismatch due to how it’s structured in the candidate sentence. On the other hand, "verstreichen" in the candidate is incorrect as it should be past tense as in "verstreichen lassen". The correct past form reflects the structure in the source sentence better where time "passed".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "umfassender" and "umso umfangreicher" convey the idea of being more comprehensive, fitting the context and meaning of the source sentence. The candidate translation accurately captures the intended meaning of the source sentence, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule because it doesn't significantly change the sentence's meaning.
known → bekannt → bekannt  	announced → angekündigt → verkündet  	heralded → angekündigt → angepeilt  	thing → Sache → Einiges  	fact → Tatsache → Dass  	agency → Agentur → Behörde  	work → befassen → kümmern  	cracking → Aufdeckung → Knacken  		**Explanation:**  	1. "already known" matches "bereits bekannt" well, so there is no mismatch here.	2. "announced" is translated as "angekündigt" in the candidate and corresponds to "verkündet" in the reference; "angekündigt" is a direct translation, but it neglects the inclusion of "heralded," which was meant to show another aspect.	3. "heralded" is also translated as "angekündigt," just like "announced," losing the variations intended in the source. The reference uses "angepiept" which aligns with "heralded."	4. "thing" is translated into "Sache," but the reference uses "Einiges," which fits the context better.	5. "fact" is translated to "Tatsache". The reference translation uses a construction "Dass," which avoids the direct noun but retains the meaning.	6. "agency" is translated as "Agentur," while the reference uses "Behörde," which fits better in the bureaucratic sense.	7. "work" becomes "befassen" (engage oneself) in the candidate but "kümmern" (take care of) in the reference. Considering the context, "kümmern" aligns better with the proactivity.	8. "cracking" is rendered as "Aufdeckung" (exposure) rather than "Knacken" (cracking), mismatching the intensity and directness of action.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Richtlinien" for "directives" and "zum Waffenrecht" for "on gun laws," which are both valid translations. There are no significant changes in meaning or context compared to the source and reference sentences. Although there is a different phrasing on "neither" with "Ebenso wenig" compared to "Auch nicht," both retain the intended meaning in this context. Thus, this follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, and no errors are reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The choice of "Forderung" (demand) instead of "Ruf" (call) is an acceptable variation. Both "überraschend" and "ebenso" translate properly within their respective contexts, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules. Thus, there are no significant single-word translation errors.
advertising → Werbung → Sympathiewerbung	jihadis → Dschihadis → Dschihadisten	remove → entfernen → abknöpfen		**Explanation:**	- "Werbung" (advertising) is a mistranslation of "Sympathiewerbung" (propaganda/soliciting support), as it loses specificity regarding the type of advertising that is meant (specifically, propaganda for terrorist groups).	- "Dschihadis" is not a standard translation of "jihadis," and "Dschihadisten" is the more commonly accepted term in German for "jihadi."	- "entfernen" (remove) suggests a different action (physically removing) than "abknöpfen" (take away/confiscate), which aligns more closely with the context of revoking a legal document such as a passport.
SPD → SPD → SPD  	issues → es → Punkte  		**Explanation:**  	- "SPD" remains unchanged between the candidate and reference translations, as it does not require translation.	- "issues" is translated as "Punkte" in the reference, but the candidate mistakenly uses "es", which doesn't convey the concept of "issues" or "points", thus changing the meaning significantly. This error requires correction based on the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Despite some differences in wording, the candidate translation accurately conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. Phrases such as "für erreichbar" (achievable) and "nichts, was beim Koalitionspartner keine Chance hat" (anything that has no chance with the coalition partner) are valid translations in this context, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "presented" and "vorgestellt" convey the same meaning, and "a few" and "einige" are acceptable translations of one another. The overall meaning remains unchanged, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules. Thus, no significant single-word translation errors are detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation is a valid translation of the source sentence. Both "beschleunigte Abschiebungsverfahren" and "mehr Möglichkeiten, Personen vor ihrer Abschiebung festzunehmen" convey the intended meaning of "accelerated processes for deportation" and "more opportunities to arrest individuals prior to their deportation," respectively. Any variations in wording, such as "Schnellverfahren für Abschiebungen" versus "beschleunigte Abschiebungsverfahren," are acceptable and do not significantly alter the meaning. Thus, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, the translation is accurate.
specifically → speziell → gezielt  	present → informieren → offenlegen  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the meaning conveyed in the source sentence. Although not identical to the reference sentence, it maintains the intended message and complies with the task's **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where variations like "refused" to "verweigert" and "commit crimes" to "Verbrechen begehen" are considered acceptable paraphrases or direct translations. Therefore, no significant meaning-altering mistranslations are present.
Some → Das → Einiges  	tricky → kompliziert → heikel  		**Explanation:** "Das" (that) mistranslates "Some" (einige), which is important for conveying that only a portion is tricky. "kompliziert" (complicated) is incorrect for "tricky" (heikel) in this context, as it fails to capture the nuance of subtle difficulties that "heikel" implies.
Some → Einige → Manches		**Explanation:** "Einige" (some) is a mistranslation of "manches" in this context, which carries a slightly different nuance. In German, "manches" is often used similarly to "some" when implying a part of a whole in a vague or nuanced manner, fitting the context better. This adheres to the **Identify Mistranslations** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules since "einige" could suggest a more definite portion, affecting the sentence's intended vague quality.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Despite minor variations in phrasing, the candidate translation retains the same meaning as the reference translation. The words used in the candidate such as "Ungleichbehandlung", "tolerierter Personen", "Sicherheit", and "Terrorismus" are accurate and contextually appropriate translations of their counterparts in the source and reference sentences. Since there are no significant meaning changes, this adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule where acceptable variations are permissible.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While there are structural differences and synonymous expressions used (e.g., "Problemen" vs. "Themen"), these do not constitute significant single-word errors and do not alter the intended meaning. Therefore, no errors are reported according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
Ansbach → Anschbach → Ansbach  	Würzburg → Witzburg → Würzburg  	perpetrators → Täter → Attentäter  		**Explanation:**  	- "Anschbach" is a misspelling of "Ansbach" and "Witzburg" is a misspelling of "Würzburg." This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as correct place names are crucial for maintaining the factual meaning of the sentence.	- "Täter" is a general term for "perpetrators" but does not capture the specific context of "attacks" as well as "Attentäter" (attackers) does. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the specificity related to the type of criminal act.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same overall meaning as the reference translation. The words in the candidate translation are valid and fit well in context, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules. Despite minor structural or stylistic differences, there are no single-word mistranslations that change the intended meaning of the source sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation ("beunruhigen", "Wahlsaison") adequately captures the meaning of the source sentence, even though the reference uses different expressions ("beschäftigten", "Wahlkampfzeiten"). These differences are variations or stylistic choices, rather than mistranslations, therefore adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and reference translation have differences, but they convey the same overall meaning. The phrase "in hohem Maße" (to a large extent) sufficiently matches "enorm" (enormously) in this context, and "Vordergrund" (foreground) is an acceptable translation for "Fokus" (focus) in this context. Therefore, no significant single-word translation error exists per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
attacks → Angriffe → Anschläge		**Explanation:** "Angriffe" (attacks) could be seen as a general word for "attacks," but "Anschläge" is a more specific term typically used for terrorist or violent attacks, as intended in this context. This significantly changes the nuance, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Ansbach → Anschbach → Ansbach  		**Explanation:** "Anschbach" is a mistranslation of "Ansbach". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it changes the name of the location.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The phrase "große Unsicherheit" (large amount of uncertainty) is a valid equivalent of "large amount of uncertainty," adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, since it preserves the overall message and context. Therefore, no significant single-word translation errors exist.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While "Wahlen" (elections) and "Wahlkämpfe" (electoral campaigns) can be seen as slightly different, in the context the meaning is preserved, and both are acceptable translations for "elections." The phrase "stehen Wahlen bevor" effectively conveys the same meaning as "stehen Wahlkämpfe an." Additionally, the omission of "Und" at the beginning does not significantly alter the meaning. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation successfully conveys the meaning of the source sentence, focusing on security as the main issue, and uses appropriate language for "consequently focusing more and more" with "konzentrieren sich daher zunehmend". Although there are structural differences and stylistic variations with the reference, the core meaning and emphasis in key areas of the sentence remain faithful to the source, hence no significant single-word errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essence of the source sentence. The phrase "recht hitzig verhalten" adequately conveys the concept of things being "quite heated," and the rest of the translation aligns closely with the source. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as there are no significant single-word errors that change the intended meaning.
bösartiges → bösartiges → garstiger  	idealistisches → idealistisches → sicherheitspolitische  	Ereignis → Ereignis → Ideen-Sammlung  		**Explanation:**  		1. "bösartiges" (malicious) is a mistranslation of "nasty", which is rendered as "garstiger" in the reference. Though "bösartig" generally means "malicious," "garstiger" (nasty) fits the intended tone of the argument better.		2. "idealistisches" (idealistic) does not match "sicherheitspolitische" (security-political). The term changes the purpose and thematic focus of the event significantly. The reference emphasizes security politics, not idealism.		3. "Ereignis" (event) is a mistranslation for "ideas-gathering event" which in the reference is "Ideen-Sammlung" (idea collection), focusing on the collection aspect rather than the event. This diminishes the emphasis on discussion of ideas, altering the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Vermittlungsnote zu finden" for "strike a conciliatory note," while the reference uses "versöhnliche Töne". "Vermittlungsnote" (mediation note) is a reasonable interpretation of a "conciliatory note," and thus this satisfies the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, indicating that the meaning remains sufficiently intact. Hence, no translation errors are recorded.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "does not think" can be translated as "glaubt nicht", "dual citizenship" as "doppelte Staatsbürgerschaft", and "will be removed" as "abgeschafft wird." Although stylistically different from the reference translation, the candidate translation conveys the correct meaning and fits contextually, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
discussions → geführt → befriedet		**Explanation:** "geführt" (conducted) is a mistranslation of the phrase "dealt with" from the source sentence. The correct translation in the reference is "befriedet" (resolved/settled), which conveys managing or resolving discussions rather than merely conducting them. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule since it changes the implied outcome of the discussions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the meaning and context of the source sentence, accurately translating "reopen discussions on this topic" as "die Diskussion über dieses Thema wieder aufzunehmen." While phrasing choices differ slightly between the candidate and reference translations ("neu aufzumachen"), both convey the same overall meaning, thus adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
burka → burka → Burka  		**Explanation:** In German, "Burka" should be capitalized as it is a noun, whereas "burka" in the candidate translation is not. This follows the rule **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**, as proper noun capitalization in German is significant for correctness and clarity. All other words maintain necessary meaning or format, ensuring no further errors are reported.
"achievable" → "machbar" → "zumutbar"		**Explanation:** "machbar" translates to "feasible" or "doable," whereas "zumutbar" fits better as "achievable" in the specific context of whether something is reasonable or acceptable for a coalition partner. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules because "machbar" lacks the nuance of acceptability that "zumutbar" provides.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both the candidate and reference translations accurately capture the overall meaning of the source sentence despite using different wording. The key elements such as "things", "problems", and "cause (or could cause)" align well with the source, ensuring contextual accuracy. The phrase "Es gibt nur wenige Dinge, die Probleme verursachen könnten" is a valid and meaningful translation, even though it uses different expressions from the reference. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation sufficiently captures the meaning of the source sentence, with "inneren Sicherheit" and "die Frage" being contextually acceptable choices for "domestic security" and "the issue," respectively. The use of "formieren" is also valid in the context of shaping oneself. Hence, no significant mistranslations can be identified.
SPD Head → SPD Chef → Parteichef  	showed → hat gezeigt → signalisiert  	discuss → diskutiert → reden  		**Explanation:**  	- "SPD Chef" should be "Parteichef" as this is a more accurate translation of "SPD Head" in the context of political titles in German.	- "hat gezeigt" translates incorrectly to "showed" when the reference translation indicates a more cautious approach, "signalisiert" aligns better with the context.	- "diskutiert" is a direct translation of "discuss", but "reden" is used in the reference, which fits more smoothly with the context of conveying openness in conversation.
Volkswagen → Volkswagen → Volkswagen  	gets → geht → kommt  	lightly → leichte Schulter → glimpflich  		**Explanation:** "Volkswagen" remains consistent across all sentences, so there is no error with that word. However, "geht" is a mistranslation of "gets," which more accurately corresponds to "kommt" in the reference. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule. The phrase "auf die leichte Schulter" translates to "take something lightly," which does not convey the same meaning as "glimpflich" (lightly as in avoiding harm or consequence) in this context, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Therefore, the correct translation should not include "leichte Schulter."
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Although there are differences in phrasing, "steigt die Zahl der weltweiten Lieferungen" accurately conveys "global delivery figures are increasing." No single word in the candidate translation significantly alters the meaning compared to the source and reference, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the intent and meaning of the source sentence sufficiently well. The use of "auf allen Märkten nicht so rosig" aligns with the meaning of "aren't quite as rosy in all markets", while the reference translation takes a different approach but expresses the same underlying sentiment. There are no significant single-word mistranslations that violate the output criteria.
recall → Rückruf → Rückrufaktion  	fuss → Bewegung → Wirbel  	term → Amtszeit → Begriff  		**Explanation:**  	- "Rückruf" (callback) is a partial mistranslation of "recall" which, in context, should refer to a "Rückrufaktion" (recall action). This is a more fitting term in the context of the sentence, according to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Bewegung" (movement) is a mistranslation of "fuss", which should be "Wirbel" (fuss or stir) to correctly convey the intended meaning, as stated in the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Amtszeit" (term of office) is a mistranslation of "term", which should be "Begriff" (term/concept) according to the context. This aligns with the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by pinpointing the mistranslation to the specific noun "term".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the same essential meaning as the reference translation, albeit with different wording. The candidate uses "zurückhaltender" (more restrained) and "Lieferungen" (deliveries), which, while slightly different in structure, maintain the intended meaning of the source sentence when considering contextual accuracy. Therefore, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, there are no significant translation errors to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation does not contain any single-word translation errors when compared to the source and the reference translation. The key elements are translated appropriately, maintaining the intended meaning of the sentence, thus adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules. While there are some differences in phrasing, they do not change the meaning significantly.
suffered → gelitten → schwächelte  	announced → ankündigte → mitteilte  	listed → aufgelistete → notierte		**Explanation:** 		- "gelitten" (suffered) is mistranslated from "schwächelte" (weakened). In this context, "suffered" should convey a weakening rather than enduring pain.	- "ankündigte" (announced) is a valid translation of "announced" in many contexts, but "mitteilte" (reported) is more fitting here given the corporate context.	- "aufgelistete" (listed) is a valid translation but in this context of stocks, "notierte" (traded/listed on an exchange) conveys the intended meaning related to the DAX index.
449,100 → 49 100 → 449100		**Explanation:** The translation error is with the number of vehicles sold. "49 100" (49,100) in the candidate translation is a mistranslation of "449,100" from the source sentence. This discrepancy significantly changes the meaning and quantity described in the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate and reference translations both accurately convey the meaning of the source sentence. The differences are stylistic or structural, but they maintain the same meaning. The percentage is expressed as "14%" in the candidate and "14 Prozent" in the reference, which is an acceptable variation. The positioning of "nach China der zweitwichtigste Markt" versus "dem zweitwichtigsten Markt nach China" is stylistic and does not alter the meaning. Hence, follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Despite differences in word choice, the candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source sentence. "Auf seinem Heimatmarkt Deutschland" is a valid translation of "In its home market of Germany." Both "Lieferungen" and "Auslieferungen" are suitable translations for "deliveries" in this context. The main verb differences with "zurückgegangen" and "sackten ab" don't alter the primary meaning of the sentence regarding the drop in deliveries. Thus, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no translation errors are reported.
1. brand → Markenleiter → Markenvertriebschef		**Explanation:** "Markenleiter" translates to "brand manager" rather than "head of brand sales" ("Markenvertriebschef"). This alters the role and title being referred to, which is significant in the context of a professional or corporate designation.
markets → Schlüsselmärkten → Kernmärkten		Explanation: "Kernmärkten" (core markets) aligns with the reference, representing key markets in a more precise manner than "Schlüsselmärkten" (key markets), given the context of importance outlined in the sentence. While both terms are possible, the difference could be meaningful in specific contexts, depending on the intended emphasis. Hence, it is worth noting. 		economic climates → Wirtschaftsklima → wirtschaftliche Rahmenbedingungen		Explanation: "Wirtschaftsklima" (economic climate) is directly translated from the source, but "wirtschaftliche Rahmenbedingungen" (economic conditions) as seen in the reference, provides a more contextually nuanced interpretation of the broader economic environment impacting purchases as described.		No other significant translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source sentence. While there are stylistic differences between the candidate and reference translations, such as the choice of "Auswirkungen" (impact) versus "belastet" (burdened), these do not change the core meaning and hence comply with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Furthermore, the key aspects of the source, i.e., the situation in Turkey and the British vote regarding the EU, have been accurately translated. Thus, there are no single-word errors that significantly alter the meaning.
emissions → Emissionsskandal → Abgasaffäre  	red → rot → ein Minus zu Buche  		**Explanation:** "Emissionsskandal" (emissions scandal) is a close, yet slightly off translation of "Abgasaffäre" (exhaust affair), as the latter term incorporates both emissions and scandal within the specific context. Although "Emissionsskandal" is not inherently incorrect, it is considered an error due to the nuanced distinction, demonstrating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. 		"rot" (red) is a literal translation and changes the intended meaning of the financial context implied by "ein Minus zu Buche" (in the red/deficit), violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule given the significant alteration in meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the same meaning as the source sentence. While the structure of the reference translation is different, the candidate accurately translates each component: "chinesische Markt" for "Chinese market," "Quelle" for "source," "großer Unterstützung" for "great support," and "für VW" for "for VW." Therefore, per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule and the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no significant single-word translation errors are identified.
am → am → hauptsächlich  	leichtfertig → leichtfertig → glimpflich  		**Explanation:** "am" (strongest) is a mistranslation of "most", which changes the degree of impact. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it describes the degree of affectation incorrectly. "leichtfertig" (reckless) is a mistranslation of "lightly", which changes the nature of the brand's response to the scandal, violating the same rule.
Fred Kappler → Fred Kapper → Fred Kappler  	sales → Verkaufs → Verkaufsplus  		**Explanation:** "Kapper" is a misspelling of "Kappler", which is the correct name of the person mentioned. This violates the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule regarding ensuring names are accurately translated. The translation of "sales" to "Verkaufs" instead of "Verkaufsplus" significantly affects the meaning of the sentence by not reflecting the positive growth aspect indicated by "an increase in sales". The term "Verkaufsplus" includes the notion of a positive change or surplus, aligning with the source meaning.
percent → % → Prozent  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "%" instead of "Prozent", which is the correct translation in this context. Despite being a common symbol, the use of "%" does not adhere to the text format used in the reference, affecting the contextual and conventional accuracy. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, even though it might seem like a minor stylistic difference.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The use of "Emissionstests" instead of "Abgastests" is acceptable as they refer to the same context, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Both versions correctly capture the intended action and subject matter without a shift in meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While there are minor differences in phrasing, such as "Fahrzeuge" versus "Wagen" or the use of "Allein" versus "Alleine," these do not significantly alter the meaning or the interpretation of the context. Both "zurückgerufen" and "ruft ... zurück" correctly convey the idea of recalling vehicles, so no single-word errors are present per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
modifying → Neuformulierung → Umrüstung  	refitting → Neuformulierung → Umbau  		**Explanation:** "Neuformulierung" (rewording) is a mistranslation of both "modifying" and "refitting" in the context of vehicles. The terms "Umrüstung" (conversion/refitting) and "Umbau" (rebuilding/conversion) are more appropriate in the context of modifying vehicles, as they relate specifically to physical alterations rather than linguistic changes.
Umrüstung → Veränderung → Umrüstung		**Explanation:** "Veränderung" (change) is a mistranslation of "Umrüstung" (modification). The term "Veränderung" is more generic, while "Umrüstung" more accurately conveys the specific context of modifying vehicles. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it fails to capture the technical nuance of vehicle modification.
manufacturer → Autohersteller → Autobauer  	modification → Änderung → Umrüstung  		**Explanation:** "Autohersteller" (car manufacturer) is a literal translation of "manufacturer," but "Autobauer" (auto builder) is more contextually accurate and commonly used in German for car manufacturers. "Änderung" (modification) is not as precise in this context as "Umrüstung" (retrofit or conversion), which fits better with industry-specific terminology. These errors significantly impact the contextual accuracy and original intended meaning, thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "rechtliche Schwierigkeiten" (legal difficulties) instead of "juristische Feinheiten" (legal intricacies), but both phrases can convey complexity in legal matters in this context. Thus, it follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule and does not significantly alter the meaning, hence no errors are reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation correctly renders the essential components and meaning of the source sentence into German. While there are differences in phrasing, such as "veränderte Dieselfahrzeuge" and "umgerüstete Dieselmodelle," the meaning remains consistent as both refer to modified diesel cars. These differences do not violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as the intended meaning is preserved.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Each word in the candidate translation can be mapped to a word in the source sentence without a significant loss of meaning. "Verkehrsministerium" is a suitable translation for "Federal Ministry of Transport" and the overall context and meaning are preserved. Therefore, no single-word translation errors are detected according to the provided guidelines.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation retains the intended meaning of the source sentence and conforms with the reference translation in terms of overall meaning. "bestätigte" translates to "confirmed," and "Treffen" is an accurate translation of "meeting." Additionally, differences in phrasing ("stattgefunden habe" vs. "es dieses Treffen gab") are acceptable variations that do not significantly alter the meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and aligns well with the reference translation. "Anforderungen" (requirements) and "Auflagen" are contextually similar, and "Untersuchungsausschusses" (investigative committee) aligns with the role of "Untersuchungskommission". The use of "KBA" remains consistent in both translations. There are no significant single-word mistranslations that change the original meaning of the source sentence, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The candidate translation aligns well with the source and reference translations. Variations such as "der Verkehrsminister" and "Bundesverkehrsminister" are both acceptable, and the party abbreviation difference (CDU vs. CSU) does not affect the translation since both are part of a coalition context commonly understood in Germany. "dem Ministerium zufolge" and "laut Ministerium" are synonymous and acceptable translations. Thus, no meaningful single-word mistranslation is detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The words "Kraftstoffverbrauch", "CO2-Emissionen", "Kraftfahrzeugleistung", "Änderung", "Typgenehmigung", and "Fahrzeugwerte" correspond well with their counterparts in the source sentence, and no significant mistranslations are present. Both sentences carry the intended meaning that the modifications do not negatively influence the specified vehicle parameters. The differences in wording between the candidate and the reference translations are acceptable variations.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation correctly conveys the meaning of the source sentence. It includes the negation "nicht" (does not) for "use," adheres to the context, and uses acceptable synonyms or variations in the rest of the sentence without changing the meaning. The differences between the candidate and reference do not amount to significant translation errors, thus following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
believes → ist der Ansicht → sieht		broad → allgemeine → weiten		motor → Kraftfahrzeug → Motorschaden		returning → zurückkehren → kommen		explanation mistakes/examples:		**Explanation:** 		1. "believes" translated as "ist der Ansicht" (is of the opinion) is incorrect versus "sieht" (sees) in the reference, which is more accurate.	   	2. "broad" translated as "allgemeine" (general) does not match the nuance of "weiten" (broad), which better fits the context of the sentence.		3. "motor" translated as "Kraftfahrzeug" (vehicle) should be "Motorschaden" (motor damage), to convey the specificity of the damage to the engine.		4. "returning" translated as "zurückkehren" (return to) should be "kommen" (come), as it fits the reference's context better.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Verbraucher" (consumers) instead of "Kunden" (customers), but in this context, they can be seen as near-synonyms and do not significantly alter the meaning. The focus of the task is on single-word errors that significantly change meaning, and this translation maintains the intended sense of the source sentence according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Deshalb" and "Deswegen" are valid translations for "This is why", maintaining the intended meaning. Both "wird verwenden" and "verwende" contextually indicate a future action of not using the term "guarantee", so the candidate translation accurately reflects the source sentence. There are no significant changes in meaning, and thus no errors are reported, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence despite some structural differences. Terms such as "Raffeisene-Bank" for "Raiffeisenbank" and "reicher Sparer" for "von reichen Sparern" maintain the intended meaning, and there are no single-word errors that significantly change the meaning or context of the sentence.
Managing Director → geschäftsführende Direktor → Bankchef  	current accounts → laufenden Konten → Girokonten  	day-to-day accounts → Konten → Tagesgeldkonten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Managing Director" is mistranslated as "geschäftsführende Direktor", while the reference uses "Bankchef", which is a more common translation in this context.	2. "current accounts" is translated as "laufenden Konten", which can imply ongoing accounts, but "Girokonten" is the correct term for checking accounts in banking contexts.	3. "day-to-day accounts" is translated simply as "Konten", which is too broad and misses the specific reference to "Tagesgeldkonten" (money market accounts), altering the intended meaning of specific account types.
Savers → Sparer → Sparer  	Isolated → Einzelfall → Einzelfall  	Penalty interest → Strafzinsen → Strafzins  	Pennies → Pfennige → Spargroschen  	Put aside → Stillgelegt → Gespart  		**Explanation:**  	- "Sparer" (savers) is correctly translated in the candidate.	- "Einzelfall" is a valid translation of "isolated case," matching the correct reference.	- "Strafzinsen" (penalty interest) slightly deviates from "Strafzins" but maintains meaning.	- "Pfennige" is a mistranslation of "Spargroschen" (pennies as savings), important for context.	- "Stillgelegt" (laid aside) is contextually incorrect for "Spargroschen," which refers to savings set aside, implying action more aligned with "gespart" (put aside).
invest → investieren → lagern		**Explanation:** The word "invest" is mistranslated as "investieren", which generally implies a longer-term investment with the expectation of profit. The correct translation in this context is "lagern", meaning "to store", which aligns with the short-term nature of overnight deposits mentioned in the source sentence. This focuses on the significant change in meaning in the context of overnight bank deposits.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While there are some differences in phrasing compared to the reference, such as "Raffeisen-Bank" vs. "Raiffeisenbank" and "privaten und geschäftlichen Kunden" vs. "Privat- und Firmenkunden," these variations do not constitute significant single-word mistranslations that alter the overall meaning. The differences are attributed to stylistic choices, and the candidate maintains the message's integrity. Hence, based on the rules, no mistranslation is detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate and reference sentences are essentially identical except for the formatting difference concerning the separator in the number "100,000". This separator difference ("100 000" vs. "100.000") does not affect the translation quality or comprehensibility, and both are acceptable number formats in German. Therefore, per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, there are no translation errors to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Both "In Zukunft" and "künftig" are appropriate translations for "In the future." Similarly, "werden dann 100 000 Euro ... kosten" reflects the intended meaning of "any subsequent 100,000 euros will cost." The structure maintains the intended meaning in context, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, no significant translation errors are found in the candidate translation.
been → verwaltet → hüte  	make use of → nutzen → verwerten  		**Explanation:** The word "verwaltet" (managing) is a mistranslation of "has been", as it changes the focus of the sentence from the continuous nature of managing to a different activity of handling or controlling the money. The phrase "nutzen" (use) captures a different nuance compared to "verwerten" (make use of), which implies exploiting or utilizing in a particular context. This adheres to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, as these changes significantly alter the intended meaning.
money → Geld → liegen  	costing → kostete → verursachen  
4000 → zur Verfügung stellen → hinlegen  		**Explanation:** In this context, "zur Verfügung stellen" (provide) is a mistranslation of "put aside" (hinlegen), which implies reserving or setting aside money rather than providing it. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by pinpointing the specific mistranslation related to the action of dealing with money.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Er schiebt die Kosten nach dem Verursacherprinzip weiter" aligns with the source sentence "He is passing on the costs under the 'polluter pays' principle" in meaning. The reference translation states, "Die Kosten gebe er nach dem Verursacherprinzip nun weiter," which slightly differs in structure but does not introduce a critical lexical error. The word "Verursacherprinzip" appropriately translates "polluter pays" principle, and all other content remains intact without significant changes in meaning. Thus, this follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, with no actionable single-word errors to report.
far → viel → viel  	cash → Geld → Bargeld  	safe → Sicherheitsbank → Tresoren  	raids → Razzien → Überfälle  	fifth → Fünftel → fünften  		**Explanation:**  	1. **far → viel → viel:** The translation from "far" to "viel" is acceptable since they both convey the idea of excessiveness. However, given the context, the specific error here is not on "far" so this could be disregarded for simplicity upon reflection. 	2. **cash → Geld → Bargeld:** "Geld" (money) is a mistranslation of "cash". The reference uses "Bargeld", which specifically denotes cash, not just money in general.	3. **safe → Sicherheitsbank → Tresoren:** "Sicherheitsbank" translates to "security bank," which incorrectly suggests the type of institution rather than the object ("safe"). The correct translation should convey the meaning of a secure container for cash.	4. **raids → Razzien → Überfälle:** "Razzien" translates to "raids" but in a different context like police raids. "Überfälle" implies robberies, fitting the bank setting better. Thus, "Razzien" changes the intended meaning.	5. **fifth → Fünftel → fünften:** "Fünftel" means "fifth" like in fractions, not ordinally as intended here with "fünften".		Upon review, the initial vague matching of "far" was not critical enough to list, aligning more closely with permissive synonym usage. Other changes significantly impact interpretations.
understanding → verstanden → Verständnis  	switched → umgestellt → wechselten  		**Explanation:** "verstanden" (understood) is a mistranslation of "understanding," which in this context implies empathy or comprehension, not the act of understanding something. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "umgestellt" (converted) is a mistranslation of "switched," as it suggests a more technical or internal change rather than simply choosing an alternative, which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Nur wenige sind in andere Banken gegangen" adequately captures the meaning of the source sentence. The translation uses "sind gegangen" (have gone) instead of "wanderten ab" (moved away), but both convey the idea of moving to different banks. Therefore, there is no significant change in meaning, and no mistranslation is reported according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
1. Federation → Verband → Genossenschaftsverband  	2. Cooperatives → Genossenschaften → Genossenschaftsverband  	3. of Bavaria → in Bayern → Bayern  	4. monetary → Währungspolitik → geldpolitische  	5. ECG → EVG → EZB  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Verband" (association) is a mistranslation of "Federation", which should be "Genossenschaftsverband" (Federation of Cooperatives) to maintain specificity within the context.	2. "Genossenschaften" (cooperatives) is part of the phrase that should translate to "Genossenschaftsverband" (Federation of Cooperatives) to convey the correct organizational structure.	3. "in Bayern" (in Bavaria) doesn't convey the same specificity as "Bayern" which has to match the structure in context.	4. "Währungspolitik" (currency policy) is a mistranslation of "monetary", which should be "geldpolitische" (monetary policy) as used in the financial context.	5. "EVG" (possibly a mistype or incorrect acronym) should be "EZB" (European Central Bank - ECB), as it denotes the correct institution responsible for monetary policy.		These mistranslations collectively change the meaning and disrupt the understanding of the sentence, based on the provided reference and source sentences.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation expresses the same essential meaning as the source and the reference translation. The phrase "dauerhaft aus unternehmerischer Sicht zu tragen" conveys the idea of bearing costs "on a permanent basis, from a business perspective", matching the sense of "betriebswirtschaftlich dauerhaft nicht möglich" in the reference. Thus, no significant single-word translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence. While "Im Ergebnis" translates to "As a result" and is a slightly different phrasing than "deshalb" (therefore), this is an acceptable variation and does not violate any of the instructions. All other elements align well with their intended meanings.
(Volks- und Raffeisen Bank → Volks- und Raiffeisenbank → Volks- und Raiffeisenbank)  	(Altenburgerland → Altenburger Land → Altenburger Land)  	(Skatban-Zweig → Skatbank-Filiale → Skatbank-Filiale)  	(Investitionszinsen → Strafzinsen → Strafzinsen)  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Volks- und Raffeisen Bank" is a mistranslation because "Raffeisen" should be "Raiffeisen" which is the correct name of the bank.	2. "Altenburgerland" is an error in spacing; it should be "Altenburger Land."	3. "Skatban-Zweig" is a misspelling of "Skatbank", and "Zweig" (branch) is not a good fit compared to "Filiale" which is more commonly used.	4. "Investitionszinsen" (investment interest) is a significant mistranslation of "Strafzinsen" (penalty interest), which alters the financial context and meaning of the transaction.
managing director → Leiter → Hauptgeschäftsführer		Explanation: "Leiter" is a general term for "leader", which is less specific than "Hauptgeschäftsführer" (managing director/CEO), a specific title. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it doesn't accurately convey the level of responsibility.		banking association → Bankverband → Bankenverband		Explanation: "Bankverband" is a mistranslation of "banking association", as it is less specific compared to "Bankenverband" which is the precise term used in the context of a formal association. This relates to the **Contextual Accuracy** where the institution's name should be correctly translated.		investments → Investitionen → Einlagen		Explanation: "Investitionen" translates to "investments" but contextually in banking, "Einlagen" (deposits) would be more accurate. This alteration significantly changes the interpretation in the financial context, impacting accurate communication as per **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.
Tgernsee → Tgernsee → Tegernsee		**Explanation:** "Tgernsee" in the candidate translation is a typographical error of "Tegernsee". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the place name has been incorrectly spelled, leading to a potential misunderstanding of the location.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The variations between "sein" (be) and "werden" (become) or "kümmert" (takes care of) and "hüte" (guard) do not significantly alter the intended message or context. Thus, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no clear translation errors that impact meaning are found.
Cooperative Bank of Gmund → Genossenschaftsbank → Genossenschaftsbank Gmund
actors → Akteure → Schauspieler  		**Explanation:** "Akteure" translates to "players" or "participants" and is not specific enough for "actors" in this context. The term "Schauspieler" explicitly refers to performers in films, television, or theater, which is the intended meaning in the source sentence. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The words "sportspeople" and "entrepreneurs" are accurately translated as "Sportler" and "Unternehmer", respectively, and do not constitute translation errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While there are differences in wording and structure between the candidate and reference translations, this task focuses on identifying and listing single-word errors that significantly change the meaning. In this case, the candidate translation maintains the overall meaning as expressed in the source sentence. The spokesperson's gender is translated as "Sprecherin" (female) instead of "Sprecher" (male), but without explicit information on Ernst's gender, this does not suffice as a significant error per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Other variations are stylistic and do not impact the core meaning.
threshold → Schwellenwert → Schwelle  	tipping → Umsteigen → ins Negative zu gehen  	red → Roten → Negative  		**Explanation:**  	- "Schwellenwert" (threshold value) is used in the candidate sentence, whereas "Schwelle" (threshold) is the direct translation in the reference sentence, suggesting a less precise choice in the candidate.	- "Umsteigen" (switching) is a mistranslation of "tipping", which changes the intended meaning of financial distress.	- "Roten" (reds) is a mistranslation of "negative", which changes the intended meaning regarding financial context.
investors → Investoren → Anleger  	competitors → Wettbewerber → Konkurrenz  		**Explanation:** "Investoren" (investors) and "Anleger" are synonyms, but in the context of competitive businesses, the term "Anleger" is often used, reflecting the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Wettbewerber" (competitors) and "Konkurrenz" both reflect competition, but "Konkurrenz" is more appropriate in the given business context, demonstrating the need for precise language choice, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation adequately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Both "hinnehmen" and "gefallen lassen" correctly capture the idea of not tolerating or putting up with something. Similarly, "im großen und ganzen" and "in der Breite" both express the phrase "broadly speaking," adhering to the acceptable variations allowed by the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, no significant single-word mistranslations are detected.
destination → Viehziel → Destination  	records → Aufzeichnungen → Schallplatten  		**Explanation:**  	"Viehziel" is a mistranslation of "destination." "Vieh" means "cattle," which doesn't match the context of "vinyl destination," while "destination" is retained as "Destination." Similarly, "Aufzeichnungen" means "recordings" or "notes," which doesn't fit the intended meaning of "records" in the sense of "vinyl records," for which "Schallplatten" is the correct word. These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
middle-aged → mittleren → mittleren Alters  	men → Menschen → Männer  	vinyl → Lebenslauf → Platten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "mittleren" needs to be part of the phrase "mittleren Alters" to correctly convey "middle-aged", complying with **Ensure Contextual Accuracy.**  	2. "Menschen" (people) is a mistranslation of "men", as it generalizes whereas the source specifies gender, violating **Prioritize Meaningful Errors.**  	3. "Lebenslauf" (resume) is a mistranslation of "vinyl", significantly changing the meaning, adhering to **Focus on Single-Word Errors.**
NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen → NollonelyMiddleageden → NichtAlleEinsamenMännerMittlerenAlters  	gnarly → starken → rauen  	comments → lesen → Kommentarteil  		**Explanation:**  	1. The pseudonym "NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen" was mistranslated as "NollonelyMiddleageden", which does not retain any of the original meaning or structure, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "gnarly" was translated as "starken", which means "strong", instead of "rauen", violating the **Identify Mistranslations** rule as it significantly changes the tone.	3. "comments" was translated as "lesen" (read) which is incorrect in the context; the correct translation should reference the comment section, "Kommentarteil", violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
millennials → Jahrtausenden → Millennials  	record → Rekordwiederaufflammen → Wiederaufstehung von Schallplatten  		**Explanation:** "Jahrtausenden" (millennia) is a mistranslation of "millennials." The sentence refers to the generational cohort, not a span of a thousand years. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Rekordwiederaufflammen" (record resurgence) is misinterpreted as "record" in the sense of "highest level" rather than referring to "record" as in vinyl discs. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, extracting "record" in its correct context.
purchased → gekauft → vor kurzem	vinyl → Kalbum → Platte		**Explanation:** "vor kurzem" in the reference is part of the adverbial phrase "have recently purchased," thus a more contextually fitting translation than just "gekauft" ("purchased"). "Kalbum" is a mistranslation of "vinyl." "Platte" (record) is the correct translation, capturing the meaning of a vinyl album in this context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Die Altersgruppe von 18 bis 24 Jahren ist in der Tat am wenigsten wahrscheinlich." accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The emphasis on the age group and their likelihood is maintained, and both "in der Tat" and "am wenigsten wahrscheinlich" are appropriate translations of "in fact" and "least likely," respectively. The minor phrase structural differences do not alter meaning significantly, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
hobbyists → Hobbyismus → Hobbysammlern  	vinyl → Weinkäufer → Plattenkäufer  	keep their feelings to themselves → sich selbst zu fühlen → ihre Gefühle für sich behalten  	being alone → einen Alleingang → alleine Zeit zu verbringen  		**Explanation:** "Hobbyismus" is a mistranslation of "hobbyists," leading to a different meaning. "Weinkäufer" (wine buyers) is a mistranslation of "vinyl buyers." "Sich selbst zu fühlen" (to feel themselves) is incorrect compared to "keep their feelings to themselves," which changes the meaning significantly. "Einen Alleingang" (going it alone) does not fit the intended context of "enjoying being alone," violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate and reference translations are identical, and thus there are no meaningful mistranslations in the candidate sentence. There is no violation of any rules, so the output correctly states that there are no translation errors.
camera → gestreckt → gestuliere  	busy → befleckten → geschäftigen  	gesturing → gestrickt → gestuliere  	cupping → mich → halte  	authoritative → Gutes → Bestimmendes  	take → an → darauf  		**Explanation:**  	1. "gestreckt" (which was mistakenly interpreted as "gesturing") is incorrect for the action in context and should be "gestuliere" which means "gesturing".  	2. "befleckten" (stained) misrepresents "busy" (geschäftigen) in the context of the busy Soho street.  	3. "gestrickt" (knitted) is a mistranslation of "gesturing" (gestuliere), describing an action that is not happening in context.  	4. "mich" (me) is incorrectly used instead of "halte" (cupping) which better represents the action described.  	5. "Gutes" (good) fails to capture the intent of "authoritative" (Bestimmendes) regarding speaking with authority.  	6. "an" does not properly convey the sense of "taking a look" as "darauf" (thereupon/referent context) does.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Also, schauen wir uns an." is a more informal variation compared to the reference translation "Also, lassen Sie uns einen Blick darauf werfen." However, it successfully conveys the intended meaning of "So, let's take a look." Therefore, this follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ignore Acceptable Variations** rules, resulting in no significant translation errors to report.
charm → Charme → Charme  	grot → Grat → einbüßt  	Eats → Essen → Restaurants  	Prets → Prets → Büros  	Paperchases → Paperkasse → Büros  	independent sellers → unabhängigen Verkäufern → unabhängige Verkäufer  	remain → gibt → gibt es  	fantastic → phantastischer → fantastischer  	specialist record shops → Fachrekordläden → Plattenspezialgeschäfte  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Charme" is consistent, and therefore the candidate translation is correct.	2. "Grat" is a mistranslation of "grot," which should be interpreted as "einbüßt" in this context, reflecting a loss of rough edge or character.	3. "Essen" translates as "food," while "Eats" should imply "restaurants" in this context.	4. "Prets" refers to a chain, typically fast-food aimed at Pret a Manger, mistakenly translated directly without adaptation. In context, "Büros" (offices) better fits the idea of change in building use.	5. "Paperkasse" is not a valid translation of "Paperchases," which implies changes towards general/commercial usage like "Büros."	6. "Unabhängigen Verkäufern" should be "unabhängige Verkäufer" to mirror the reference phrase.	7. "Gibt" is an awkward translation for "remain," which needs "gibt es" for proper context.	8. "Phantastischer" vs. "fantastischer" is a minor spelling variation but the candidate sentence still correctly conveys the meaning.	9. "Fachrekordläden" incorrectly splits and translates "specialist record shops," where "Plattenspezialgeschäfte" captures it correctly in reference culture (Platte = record, Spezialgeschäft = specialty shop).
stop → nicht länger → auszuschalten  	gauge → messen → einzuschätzen  		**Explanation:** "nicht länger in den nächsten Teil zu rollen" (not longer to roll into the next part) is a mistranslation of "stop rolling for the next bit", which changes the intended meaning of stopping the camera from recording. The correct phrase "auszuschalten" (to turn off) is more appropriate in this context, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "messen" (measure) is a mistranslation of "gauge" which, in this context, should be "einzuschätzen" (to assess), changing the way the evaluation is conceptualized and not following the **Contextual Accuracy**.
Sister Ray → Ster Ray → Sister Ray  	Reckless Records → intellekten Rekorden → Reckless Records  	perusing → ermöglicht → geht durch  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Ster Ray" is a mistranslation of "Sister Ray." This is a name that should remain unchanged.  	2. "intellekten Rekorden" (intellect records) is a mistranslation of "Reckless Records," which is likely the name of a record store and should not be altered.  	3. "ermöglicht" (enables) is a mistranslation of "perusing" (going through/exploring). This changes the intended meaning of Stuart's actions in the shops.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source sentence by appropriately translating the key elements "Is he a collector?" and "I ask" into German. The word order difference between "Ich frage:" and "frage ich?" does not significantly alter the meaning and is an acceptable variation, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While "nehme an" (suppose) and "schätze schon" (guess so) are slightly different, they both convey a similar meaning of tentative agreement or supposition. This variation adheres to the **Allowable Variations** rule, hence no significant mistranslation is detected.
records → Unterlagen → Platten		**Explanation:** "Unterlagen" (documents) is a mistranslation of "records" in this context, as it refers to music or data records rather than written documents. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as using "Unterlagen" changes the intended meaning related to music or data collections.
records → Aufzeichnungen → Schallplatten	pictured → aufgestellt → abgebildet	snap → Sprung → Schnappschuss	mahned → gemahnt → geschickt	zuhause → zuhause → nach Hause	legen → legen → kleiden	Lebenszimmermauern → Lebenszimmermauern → Wohnzimmer		**Explanation:**	- "Aufzeichnungen" (records) does not capture the meaning of "Schallplatten" (vinyl records). This alters the context significantly.	- "aufgestellt" (set up) does not align with "abgebildet" (pictured), changing the meaning about how the records are presented.	- "Sprung" (jump) is a mistranslation for "Schnappschuss" (snap or photograph).	- "gemahnt" (reminded) is incorrectly used for "geschickt" (sent).	- "zuhause" (at home) should be "nach Hause" (to home) to imply direction, but this is more of a structural tweak than a single-word error. No error in this context as it is a nuance, following the Handle Ambiguity Carefully rule.	- "legen" (lay) does not accurately represent "kleiden ... aus" (line). It fails to convey the idea of decorating the walls.	- "Lebenszimmermauern" (living room walls) is inappropriate for "Wohnzimmer" (living room) and further complicated with "Wände" (walls), not a single word focus, but impacting meaning heavily, thus correcting it as "Wohnzimmer" is key.
albums → Einzelne → Singles  	records → Rekorde → Platten  		**Explanation:** "Einzelne" (individuals) is a mistranslation of "singles", which are types of music records in this context. "Rekorde" (records, as in achievements) is incorrect for the music context, where "Platten" (records, as in vinyl) is appropriate. These errors significantly alter the meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
things → sich herauskristallisiert → erschienen		**Explanation:** The phrase "sich herauskristallisiert" (crystallized) is used in the candidate translation, which does not accurately convey the intended meaning of "came out" or "appeared" in context. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it inaccurately represents the concept of things becoming available or known in a particular time period.
purchase → kaufen → Platten	records → Aufzeichnungen → Platten	introverts → diejenigen → introvertiert	company → Unternehmen → alleine Zeit verbringen		**Explanation:**	- "Aufzeichnungen" (records) should have been translated as "Platten" (records in the sense of music records), following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** guideline for the specific context of the source.	- The phrase "those who purchase records" involves a contextual translation error where "Platten" (music records) should be used instead of "Aufzeichnungen," thus linked also to "purchase." However, the same word is re-used twice, thus once is sufficient here.	- "diejenigen" (those) was used instead of "introvertiert" (introverts), violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Unternehmen" (company as in business) was misused for "their own company," which contextually means "spending time alone," hence the correct phrase being "alleine Zeit verbringen."
vice → Leib → Laster  		**Explanation:** "Leib" (body) is a mistranslation of "vice". The sentence is discussing a personal flaw or weakness, not something related to the body, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The reference translation uses "Laster", which correctly captures the meaning of "vice".
Wez → Nun → Wez  	who → die → der  	YouGov → Yougow → YouGov  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Nun" is a mistranslation of "Wez". The name of the person is crucial for identifying who is being talked about, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "die" is incorrect for "who" since the reference uses "der", which is more contextually appropriate when referring to a male person ("Wez").	3. "Yougow" is a misspelling of "YouGov", which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as brand names should be translated correctly.
media hype → Medienhype → Medienhpe  	records → Rekorde → Platten  		**Explanation:** "Medienhype" contains a typo and should be "Medienhpe" according to the reference. This subtly changes the correctness but retains meaning, yet it's still a word-level error. "Rekorde" (records) is a mistranslation of "Platten" (records, in the context of music albums), violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence and aligns well with the reference translation. There are no single-word errors that significantly change the meaning. All the translated words fit contextually and maintain the intended meaning, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
vinyl → Winz → Platten  	records → Unterlagen → Platten  		**Explanation:** "Winz" is not a correct translation of "vinyl", which are records in the musical sense, while "Platten" (records) fits the context. "Unterlagen" (documents) is also incorrect in this context, whereas "Platten" (records) should have been used, aligning with the musical theme. These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as they significantly alter the meaning related to music records.
boom → Rebellen → Boom  	vinyl revivalists → Rebellen → Anhängern des Plattenrevivals  		**Explanation:** The translation of "boom" as "Rebellen" (rebels) is incorrect, as "boom" refers to a surge or increase, and "Rebellen" changes the meaning significantly. Similarly, "vinyl revivalists" is translated as "Rebellen," which is incorrect, as it changes the intended meaning of people who are into the renewal or revival of vinyl records. "Anhänger des Plattenrevivals" specifically refers to followers or enthusiasts of the vinyl revival. Both errors affect the sentence's meaning significantly, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
records → Unterlagen → Platten		**Explanation:** "Unterlagen" (documents) is a mistranslation of "records" in this context, where it refers to "records" in the musical sense, which is correctly translated as "Platten". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Unterlagen" does not convey the specific type of records implied in the context of music.
record stores → Rekordlager → Plattengeschäfte	likeminded types → ähnlicher Arten → Gleichgesinnten		**Explanation:** "Rekordlager" (record warehouse) is a mistranslation of "record stores," which significantly misrepresents the setting described in the source sentence. "ähnlicher Arten" (similar types) is an incorrect formation, leading to misunderstanding, unlike "Gleichgesinnten" (likeminded people), which accurately conveys the intended meaning of shared affinity among people.
umbrage → blamiert → Anstoß  		**Explanation:** "blamiert" (embarrassed) is a mistranslation of "umbrage", which changes the intended meaning of the sentence. The correct term should reflect taking offense or exception, as indicated by the reference word "Anstoß". This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as the misunderstanding of the customer's reaction is significant.
vinyl → Rebellen → Platten  	overwhelmed → überrannt → überwältigt  	record sleeve → Rekordschlag → Schallplattenhüllen  	halcyon → halzyonische → glückliche  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Rebellen" (rebels) is a mistranslation of "vinyl", which refers to fans of vinyl records (Plattenfans) not rebels.	2. "überrannt" (overrun) changes the meaning of "overwhelmed". The context is about feeling overwhelmed, not overrun.	3. "Rekordschlag" (record stroke) is incorrect for "record sleeve". The correct term for the context is "Schallplattenhüllen" (record sleeve).	4. "halzyonische" is an incorrect translation of "halcyon". The reference uses "glückliche" which accurately captures the intended meaning of nostalgically happy memories.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the overall meaning of the source sentence despite stylistic differences. The structure and vocabulary accurately reflect the intended message without introducing any significant errors that alter the sentence's meaning. Following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, the translation is acceptable.
easy → einfache → einfacher  	way → Art → Weg  	headspace → Hauptraum → geistig  		**Explanation:** "einfache" should be "einfacher", matching the masculine gender of "ein Weg". "Art" (kind/type) does not accurately reflect "way" in this context, where "Weg" has a more precise meaning as a method or approach. "Hauptraum" (main room) mistranslates "headspace", which in this context refers to mental space; "geistig" (mentally) is the term used in the reference for this intention.
pipes up → heraufbeschwören → flötet		**Explanation:** The phrase "heraufbeschwören" (to conjure up) is a mistranslation of "pipes up". The intended meaning is that the co-worker is speaking abruptly or suddenly, which "flötet" (pipes, chirps) conveys better in this context. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as the translation affects the tone of the sentence.
bought → gekauft haben → gekauft  	vinyl album → Weinalbum → Platte  	listen → hören mussten → angehört  		**Explanation:**  	1. **"gekauft haben" (bought) is translated literally, but "**"hatten" (past perfect) is more fitting in this context, which is supported by the reference translation. Therefore, "bought" in past perfect tense should align with "ge" format before verbs in German.  	2. **"Weinalbum" (Wein = wine) is clearly a mistranslation of "vinyl album".** The specific medium "vinyl" is essential, so "Platte" (record) is the appropriate choice.	3. **"hören mussten" (had to listen) changes the meaning from "yet to listen" (implying they simply haven't) to a sense of obligation ("mussten").** Therefore, the correct phrase should be "angehört" (listened).  		These significance errors align with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as each element either shifts the original meaning or introduces elements inappropriate to the context.
turntable → Tafel → Plattenspieler  	purchase → Erwerber → kaufen  		**Explanation:** The word "Tafel" is a mistranslation of "turntable" and does not fit within the context as people are more likely to own or discuss owning a "turntable" (Plattenspieler) for vinyl records. Similarly, "Erwerber" (acquirers) does not correctly capture the action described by "purchase," which should be translated as "kaufen" (to buy), aligning with the intended action of buying records. These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules.
gravely → mit großer Sorge → sehr besorgt	flicking → durchquere → blättere 	compilations → Beschwerden → Kompilationen		**Explanation:** 	1. "mit großer Sorge" (with great concern) is a mistranslation of "gravely concerned", which should be translated as something similar to "sehr besorgt" (very concerned).	2. "durchquere" (to cross) is a mistranslation of "flicking", which is more accurately translated as "blättere" (to flick or leaf through).	3. "Beschwerden" (complaints) is a mistranslation of "compilations", which should be translated as "Kompilationen". Each of these errors significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
trophy → trophische → Trophäenaspekt  	Sounds → Sonnen → Sounds  	midde-aged → mittelalterliche → mittleren Alters  		**Explanation:**  	1. **trophy → trophische → Trophäenaspekt**: The term "trophische" (trophic) is an incorrect translation of "trophy". The correct translation in this context is "Trophäenaspekt".	2. **Sounds → Sonnen → Sounds**: "Sonnen" (suns) is a mistranslation of "Sounds", which refers to the name of a store or place and should be translated correctly to maintain the proper noun.	3. **midde-aged → mittelalterliche → mittleren Alters**: "mittelalterliche" (medieval) is a mistranslation of "midde-aged", which should be "mittleren Alters" in German to correctly indicate age.
record player → Rekordspieler → Plattenspieler  	Radiohead → Radiokopf → Radiohead  	record → Liste → Schallplatte  		**Explanation:** "Rekordspieler" is a mistranslation of "record player"; the correct word is "Plattenspieler". "Radiokopf" is a mistranslation of "Radiohead," which should remain "Radiohead" as it is the name of a band and not to be translated. "Liste" is a mistranslation of "record"; in this context, it should be "Schallplatte" to refer to a vinyl record. These errors are significant as they alter the intended meaning or misrepresent specific entities.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "hoher" (high) and "großer" (large) both convey the idea of the percentage being notable in size or amount. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where acceptable variations are not marked as errors since the core meaning remains the same.
(product → Produkte → produktlastig)		**Explanation:** "Produkte" (products) is a mistranslation of "product side" (produktlastig). The candidate translation lacks the emphasis on the aspect or side of products, which the source sentence and reference translation have. Hence, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule and the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, "produkte" is marked as incorrect.
record player → Rekordspieler → Plattenspieler  		**Explanation:** "Rekordspieler" is a mistranslation of "record player." The correct term in German for "record player" is "Plattenspieler." This error significantly changes the meaning of the sentence to something nonsensical, addressing the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
younger → nicht → jüngere  	older → jüngere → ältere  	late teens → verspätete zehn → erst langsam  		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation:	- "nicht" is incorrectly placed and mistranslates "younger;" it should directly refer to "jüngere" without a negation, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "jüngere" mistranslates "older" within the context, which is the opposite, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "verspätete zehn" awkwardly translates "late teens," but contextually means something different from "coming into it slowly," violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule with "verspätete" (late) substituting "erst langsam" (slowly starting/entering).
Fopp → Mopp → Fopp  	vinyl → Weinbau → Schallplatten  		**Explanation:** "Mopp" (mop) is a mistranslation of "Fopp," which is a specific name and should not be translated. This adheres to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the proper noun "Fopp" needs to remain unchanged. "Weinbau" (viticulture) is a mistranslation of "vinyl," which in the context means "Schallplatten" (records). This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule and changes the intended meaning significantly, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
couples → Jahren → Paare  	photos → nehmen → machen  		**Explanation:** "Jahren" (years) is a mistranslation where "couples" were misrepresented as being in the "70er Jahren" rather than "70s." This changes the specific meaning tied to the age of the couples in the source sentence. 		For "photos," the word "nehmen" (take) does not fit well with the context as in German, one would say "Fotos machen" (to take photos). The correct translation should use "machen" to convey the intended action properly.
1. atmosphere → Atmosphäre → Atmosphäre		2. ease → bequem → entspannt		3. stores → Lager → Geschäften		4. Wild Beast's latest synth- and sex-fuelled pop → der jüngste Synth- und der sexuell geförderte Pop → Wild Beasts neuester Synthesizer- und sexbepackter Pop		5. speakers → Redner → Lautsprechern		6. is blasting → ist → dröhnt		Explanation:  	- **ease → bequem → entspannt**: "bequem" translates as "comfortable" rather than "at ease" or "relaxed," which is the intended meaning.	- **stores → Lager → Geschäften**: "Lager" means "warehouses" in German, which doesn't fit the context. "Geschäften" (stores) is the correct term.	- **Wild Beast's latest synth- and sex-fuelled pop → der jüngste Synth- und der sexuell geförderte Pop → Wild Beasts neuester Synthesizer- und sexbepackter Pop**: "sexuell geförderte" is an incorrect translation of "sex-fuelled," which in this context should instead convey a vibrant or bold aspect, as captured by "sexbepackter." The structure also misrepresents the connection between music and the band Wild Beasts.	- **speakers → Redner → Lautsprechern**: "Redner" means "speaker" as in a person who speaks, not audio equipment, which is what "Lautsprechern" refers to.	- **is blasting → ist → dröhnt**: "ist" translates as "is," which misses the action described by "blasting," accurately captured by "dröhnt" (booming/resounding).		**Note:** The first line contains an inconsistency with "atmosphere → Atmosphäre → Atmosphäre." While "atmosphere" translates the same to "Atmosphäre" in both candidate and reference, this is present to align with the explanation structure only, detailing which parts were considered: however, no mistranslation occurred with the word "atmosphere" itself.
nagging → Anbringen → nagende  	psychological → psychologischer → psychische  		**Explanation:** "Anbringen" (attaching/affixing) is a mistranslation of "nagging", which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence as it pertains to psychological trauma. This aligns with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "psychologischer" (psychological) should be "psychische" (psychic/mental) in this context, to more accurately match "psychological" as it relates to trauma, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
records → Verkaufsdaten → Platten  		**Explanation:** "Verkaufsdaten" (sales data) is a mistranslation of "records", which in this context refers to vinyl records. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "records" in the context of a store likely refers to music records rather than data.
window-shopping → Fenster Shopping → Schaufensterbummel  	spending spree → Ausgabenschlange → Großeinkauf  		**Explanation:** "Fenster Shopping" is a direct but inaccurate translation of "window-shopping", which should be "Schaufensterbummel" to convey the intended pastime of looking without buying. "Ausgabenschlange" is a mistranslation of "spending spree", which should be "Großeinkauf" to indicate a large-scale purchase or shopping activity. These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules because the candidate words do not fit the intended meaning in context.
earn → verdient → verdient  	records → Unterlagen → Platten  		**Explanation:** "Platten" (records) refers to music records in the reference, while "Unterlagen" (documents) changes the meaning, significantly impacting the context as it is a different kind of record. The verb "verdient" accurately translates "earn," so it is not a mistranslation and should not be listed; thus the list of output errors will only include the word related to the concept of "records."
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "Das" in the candidate translation is a slight deviation from "Es" in the reference translation. However, in this context, "Das kostet viel" and "Es kostet viel" can be used interchangeably in German to convey the meaning "It costs a lot." This aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as the meaning is preserved.
computer → Weins → Computer  	vinyl → Weins → Platten  	lovestruck → Lieblingshock → verliebten  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Weins" (wine) is a mistranslation for both "computer" and "vinyl", which is not contextually correct as neither word relates to wine in any meaningful way in this context.	2. "Lieblingshock" (favorite nook) is a mistranslation of "lovestruck", which significantly alters the intended emotional expression of the speaker.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the reference translation. The difference between "das erklären" and "es erklären" does not significantly change the meaning of the sentence, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Both expressions are valid in this context.
fresh → Rebellenliebhaber → Plattenliebhaber		stop → Schluss → Halt		shop → Laden → Geschäft		**Explanation:** "Rebellenliebhaber" (rebel lovers) is a mistranslation of "vinyl lovers", which alters the meaning significantly. "Schluss" (conclusion) does not correctly convey "stop" in this context, which should be "Halt". Lastly, "Laden" (shop) is less contextually accurate than "Geschäft" (business/store) given the original sentence's context of a specific store, Urban Outfitters.
denim → Demis-heiße → Jeans-Hotpants  	illusion → Illusion → Anschein  	pants → Pflanzen → Hotpants  	deliberate → vorsätzlich → überlegen  	record → Rekordspieler → Plattenspieler  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Demis-heiße" is a mistranslation of "denim hot pants." "Demis" is not a relevant word in this context, and "heiße Pflanzen" (hot plants) is an extremely incorrect rendering of "hotpants."	2. "Illusion" is not the best fit for "illusion" in this context, as "Anschein" is more appropriate for giving the false impression.	3. "Pflanzen" (plants) is clearly incorrect for "pants," and should be "Hotpants."	4. "vorsätzlich" (deliberately) does not convey the correct meaning of "deliberate" in the context of considering a purchase; "überlegen" would be the more appropriate term.	5. "Rekordspieler" refers to a "record player" but it's an anglicism while the more suitable term is "Plattenspieler," which refers to a turntable or record player in a typical German context.
records → Rekorden → Platten  	stairwell → Durcheinander → Treppenhaus  	wall → Mauer → Wand  	classics → Klassen → Klassikern   	stacked → belegt → voller  		**Explanation:**  	- "Rekorden" (records in the sense of achievements or data) is a mistranslation of "records" (music albums) in this context and should be "Platten."	- "Durcheinander" (mess) is a mistranslation of "stairwell" (Treppenhaus), significantly changing the spatial description.	- "Mauer" (wall, often implying an outer or structural wall) is a less contextually accurate word for the internal "Wand" used inside buildings.	- "Klassen" (classes) is a mistranslation of "classics" (Klassikern), changing the intended connotation related to classic music or artists.	- "belegt" (occupied or covered) does not convey the intended meaning of "stacked," where "voller" (full of) is more appropriate to describe the wall filled with records.
looking → schaut zu → sieht sie sich an  	touch → angreifen → anfassen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "schaut zu" (looks at) is a mistranslation of "looking" which is better expressed as "sieht sie sich an" (looks at them) or similar phrasing in this context. It involves both perception and engagement with the eyes directly at the objects discussed.	2. "angreifen" (attack) is an incorrect choice for "touch". "Anfassen" (touch) is more contextually appropriate because it involves physical contact without aggression, which follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
art → Kunstwinkel → Plattenkunst		**Explanation:** "Kunstwinkel" (art angle) is a mistranslation of "art vinyl", which refers to a particular artistic format involving vinyl records. The correct translation here is "Plattenkunst", which captures the intended meaning. This translation error follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because "Kunstwinkel" significantly changes the meaning in the context.
Aber → Da → Aber  	beschwer → beschweren → beschweren  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Aber" (but) in the source sentence is translated as "Da" (given that) in the candidate, which changes the sentence's conjunction and intent, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	2. "beschwer" is the incorrect form of "beschweren" (to complain). The correct word form "beschweren" is necessary for the sentence structure, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
likely → wahrscheinlicher → mehr	items → Weinbau → Gegenstände	vinyl → Weinbau → Platten		**Explanation:** 	- "wahrscheinlicher" (more likely) is a mistranslation of "has more", which incorrectly emphasizes the certainty rather than the quantity of time and money that the demographic possesses, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Weinbau" (viticulture) is a mistranslation of "items", specifically affecting the context of "luxury items". Therefore, according to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, it is reduced to the word-level mistranslation.	- "Weinbau" (viticulture) is again a mistranslation of "vinyl", a specific type of luxury item in the context of this sentence, and the significant change in meaning violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
number → Zahl → Anzahl		Explanation: "Zahl" (number) in the candidate sentence should be "Anzahl" according to the reference. "Anzahl" is more contextually accurate when referring to a "number of people," which maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Anzahl" better fits the context provided by the reference translation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The difference between "wahrscheinlich" and "vermutlich" is negligible in this context as both convey the meaning of "probably". The phrase "in der Schule oder in Büros hart" correctly translates the structure and meaning of the source sentence, aligning with the reference translation. Hence, no significant errors are detected that alter the intended meaning.
1. loitering → sich zu drehen → Bummeln  	2. record → Rekorden → Platten  	3. fake → schleichenden → falschen  	4. presenter → Präsidenten → Moderator  	5. looming → hinwegsetzt → aufragt  		**Explanation:**  	- "sich zu drehen" (to turn around) is a mistranslation of "loitering" as it changes the meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Rekorden" is an incorrect singular/plural form error. It changes the context since "records" translates to "Platten" when referring to vinyl.	- "schleichenden" (sneaky) is not contextually accurate for "fake," violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The intention was deceitful or unauthentic, best translated as "falschen."	- "Präsidenten" (president) is a mistranslation of "presenter," which should be "Moderator," violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "hinwegsetzt" (overcomes) is a mistranslation of "looming," which should be "aufragt" as it changes the imagery intended in the sentence.
longest-living → ältestes → am längsten lebende  		**Explanation:** "ältestes" (oldest) is a mistranslation of "longest-living," which changes the sentence's intended meaning regarding lifespan. This significantly alters the description of the Greenland shark's longevity attributes, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
vertebrate → Wirbels → Wirbeltieren  		**Explanation:** "Wirbels" (vertebrae) is a mistranslation of "vertebrate", as it refers to individual bones in the spine rather than an entire vertebrate organism. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the meaning shifts from living organisms to parts of a skeleton.
record → Frau → Weibchen  	says → erhalten → lag  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Frau" (woman) is a mistranslation of "female" in this context where it refers to an animal. The correct term in the context of animals would be "Weibchen". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "Frau" would not be used to describe a female shark.	2. "erhalten hat" (has received) is a mistranslation of the word "record" as a verb, which should refer to the noun concept of a "record" being set by the object, not someone receiving something. The correct phrasing should indicate the record belonging to the female shark. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule as "erhalten" is incorrect and changes the intended meaning to something wrongly possessive.
court → Gericht → Gericht  	shop → Geschäften → Geschäfte  	Jungle → Juncker → Dschungel  		**Explanation:**  	- "Gericht" is correctly translated for "court," so it is not a mistranslation despite the good faith comparison to confirm it matches the reference.	- "Zerschlagung" (smashing/dismantling) is an incorrect translation compared to "Abriss" (demolition), but since the task requires single-word errors, it is focused on the primary noun impacted "shop" which is "Geschäften" in both cases is part of this error report.	- "Juncker" is a clear error and does not match the "Dschungel" of the reference. "Dschungel" explicitly translates back to "Jungle," fitting the correct contextual meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. The word choices such as "Antrag" for "bid", "Behörden von Calais" for "Calais authorities", and "Zerschlagung" for "demolish" are contextually appropriate and do not significantly alter the meaning. Therefore, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, there are no meaningful translation errors to report.
makeshift → Aufsichtsläden → provisorische  	knock down → abschalten → niederzureißen  	haircuts → Harikkürzungen → Friseurdienstleistungen  	basic meals → Grundmehle → einfache Mahlzeiten  		**Explanation:** 	- "Aufsichtsläden" (supervisory stores) is a mistranslation of "makeshift," which describes the temporary nature of the shops. The correct translation here is "provisorische."	- "abschalten" (to switch off) is a mistranslation of "knock down." The correct action in this context is "niederzureißen" (to tear down).	- "Harikkürzungen" is not a correctly spelled German word; it appears to be a corruption of "haircuts." The correct term is "Friseurdienstleistungen" (hair services).	- "Grundmehle" (basic flours) is a mistranslation of "basic meals." The intended meaning is about simple meals, translated as "einfache Mahlzeiten."
places → Orte → diese Orte  	represented → repräsentieren → darstellen würden  	carried → mit sich brachten → bergen  	sanitation → Sanitäreinrichtungen → Sanitätsrisiko  		**Explanation:**		1. **places → Orte → diese Orte:** The candidate translation "Orte" misses the demonstrative "diese," which is present in the reference translation and changes the specificity of the places being referred to.	  	2. **represented → repräsentieren → darstellen würden:** The candidate uses "repräsentieren" (to represent in the present) instead of "darstellen würden" (would represent), which matches the conditional tense in the original sentence and the reference translation.		3. **carried → mit sich brachten → bergen:** "mit sich brachten" (brought with them) isn't the correct equivalent for "carried" in this context; "bergen" (to pose) is a more accurate translation for indicating risks as stated in the reference.		4. **sanitation → Sanitäreinrichtungen → Sanitätsrisiko:** The German word "Sanitäreinrichtungen" (sanitary facilities) doesn't reflect the intended meaning of the risks associated with sanitation. "Sanitätsrisiko" (sanitation risk) is correct because it captures the context of potential sanitary issues.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the meaning of the source sentence accurately, and no significant mistranslations that would change the meaning were identified. While some words differ between the candidate and the reference, such as "bezeichnet" versus "teilten mit," both adequately convey the idea of informing or telling in context. Thus, no single-word translation errors are reported.
makeshift → Behelfsläden → provisorischen  	argued → argumentierten → führten aus  		**Explanation:** "Behelfsläden" (makeshift shops) uses the correct word root, but it inaccurately specifies "shops" instead of a broader meaning "provisorischen" (makeshift). "Argumentierten" (argued) is used incorrectly as the reference suggests it should communicate further explanation "führten aus" (explained), which is more aligned with the context of highlighting assistance provided by the shops and restaurants.
legal → Rechtsgrundlage → rechtliche  	people → Personen → Leuten  	shops → Behelfsläden → Geschäfte  	said → sagte → räumte ein  	concerns → Sorgen → Bedenken  	Calais prefect → Präfekten Calais → Präfektur von Calais  		**Explanation:**   	1. "Rechtsgrundlage" (legal basis) and "rechtliche Grundlage" (legal basis) differ slightly, where "rechtlich" better matches "legal" in this context.  	2. "Personen" (persons) and "Leuten" (people) have different connotations, with "Leuten" being more informal and fitting the context here.  	3. "Behelfsläden" (makeshift shops) and "Geschäfte" (shops) convey different levels of permanence, where "Geschäfte" matches "shops" more closely.  	4. "sagte" (said) and "räumte ein" (acknowledged) can convey different nuances; "räumte ein" is a better match for the context.  	5. "Sorgen" (worries) and "Bedenken" (concerns) are close, but "Bedenken" aligns better with "concerns".  	6. "Präfekten Calais" (Calais prefect) and "Präfektur von Calais" (prefecture of Calais) differ, where the latter is more accurate given the context.
groceries → Gärten → Lebensmittelgeschäfte  	cafes → Kabeln → Cafés  		**Explanation:** "Gärten" (gardens) is a mistranslation of "groceries". This is an error as groceries and gardens refer to completely different concepts, altering the meaning of the original sentence. "Kabeln" (cables) is a mistranslation of "cafes", which significantly changes the meaning because cables are unrelated to food services. Both errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
spaces → Räume → Bereiche		**Explanation:** "Räume" (rooms) is a mistranslation of "spaces". While "Räume" might refer to physical rooms, "Bereiche" more accurately reflects versatile areas or spaces in the context of the meeting points, maintaining the intended flexibility. This aligns with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Jungle → Junelle → Jungle  	Café → Kids → Café  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Junelle" is an incorrect translation of "Jungle". The candidate seems to have altered the proper noun "Jungle", which should remain unchanged as it is a specific name of a place.	2. The word "Kids" should not substitute "Café". The correct translation of the location's name should preserve "Café" as part of the proper noun, following the context given in the reference translation. This error modifies the meaning significantly, as it alters the name of the establishment being described.
kids' → Kinder → Kids' Café  		**Explanation:** "Kinder" (children) is a mistranslation of "kids'" that does not capture the specific context of a "kids' cafe." This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Kinder" changes the intended subject that needs protection from the specific reference to the café.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The structure and key terms like "Schließung" (closure), "Katastrophe" (catastrophe), and "acht Jahre alt" (eight years old) align well with the reference. Although the wording differs slightly, it does not constitute a meaningful error under the provided instructions.
Help → Helfe → Help  	Jungle → Dschile → Dschungellager  	increase → Anstiegsrate → Zunahme  		**Explanation:** "Helfe" (helping) is a mistranslation of the proper noun "Help" as part of the organization's name and violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Dschile" appears to be a misinterpretation of "Jungle" and does not fit semantically in this context, violating **Identify Mistranslations**. "Anstiegsrate" (increase rate) is not accurate for "increase" because it introduces a different concept than a mere "rise", which affects the overall meaning referring to the context of new arrivals, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the integrity of the source sentence, effectively conveying the same meaning. The variations between "olympische Enttäuschung" and "Olympia-Enttäuschung", as well as "behält seinen Kampfgeist" and "bleibt kämpferisch", are acceptable. Both deliver the intended sentiment and context of the source sentence, hence no significant errors to report.
- time trial → Prozess → Zeitfahren  	- cycling → Profil → Radprofi  	- keep his chin up → am Rennen halten → nicht unterkriegen lassen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Prozess" (process) is a mistranslation of "time trial," which should be "Zeitfahren" in this context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the term used does not fit the specific sporting context of a time trial.  	- "Profil" appears to be a truncated form or misunderstanding of "professional," but in this context, it should be "Radprofi" (cycling professional). This aligns with the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by identifying the contextually inappropriate word.  	- "am Rennen halten" (hold on in the race) does not convey the idiomatic expression "keep his chin up," which means to remain optimistic or resilient. The reference translation, "nicht unterkriegen lassen," captures the correct idiomatic meaning. Thus, this highlights a key meaning alteration as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** guideline.  
years → Jahre → -Jährige  	journey → Heimreise → Abreise  		**Explanation:**  	- "Jahre" (years) is a mistranslation of "31-year-old". The correct German expression for this context is "31-Jährige" (31-year-old).	- "Heimreise" (journey home) is close in meaning but "Abreise" (departure) is more contextual in this case, reflecting the act of leaving Rio.
12th → Abendstunde → zwölften  	finish → Abendstunde → Platz  	Sugar Loaf Mountain → Zuckerloaf-Berg → Zuckerhut  		**Explanation:** "Abendstunde" (evening hour) is a mistranslation for both "12th" and "finish", as the context clearly refers to a poor performance ("finish") resulting in a specific position or rank ("12th place"). "Zuckerloaf-Berg" is an incorrect and awkward translation of "Sugar Loaf Mountain", with "Zuckerhut" being the correct German term for this well-known location.
It's hard → Es ist schwer → Mir fällt schwer  	comment → zu kommentieren → zu kommentieren  	my time → meine Zeit → das Zeitfahren  		**Explanation:** 	- "It's hard" is translated as "Es ist schwer" in the candidate, which structurally differs from "Mir fällt es schwer" in the reference. While both convey a similar difficulty, the German reference emphasizes the personal challenge more explicitly.	- "comment" is consistently translated across candidate and reference; hence, no error here.	- "my time" is literally translated to "meine Zeit" in the candidate, but "das Zeitfahren" in the reference suggests a specific event or context that "my time" does not capture. The reference translation seems to imply "time trial" or a specific event from the previous day rather than the generic "my time."
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In both the candidate and reference translations, the key meanings of the source sentence are preserved. The candidate translation uses "reflektieren und analysieren" for "reflect and analyse," which, while a literal translation, is contextually valid. The focus remains on understanding the reasons behind the debacle. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, and no errors that significantly change the meaning are present.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, and there are no significant single-word mistranslations that alter the intended meaning. Any differences, such as "compete" being translated as "konkurrieren" instead of "mitkämpfen", or the omission of "time trial", are stylistic or structural choices that do not introduce errors in this context. This aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as the key elements of time, location, and intent are maintained.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "genau ansehen" which is interchangeable with "genau anschauen" for "take a look." While there are some differences, like "alles" being missing or changes between "geändert" and "verändert," these do not significantly affect the meaning or are considered acceptable variations in this context, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Additionally, "in letzter Zeit" and "in der letzten Zeit" both correctly refer to "recently." Thus, no significant single-word translation errors are detected.
three-time → Dreimonatsprobe → dreimalige  	time trial → World Champion → Zeitfahr-Weltmeister  	race → Wechsels → 54,5 km  		**Explanation:** "Dreimonatsprobe" (three-month sample) is a mistranslation of "three-time," which is supposed to refer to an athlete's multiple championships. "World Champion" is left untranslated in the candidate and should be "Zeitfahr-Weltmeister" in German. "Wechsels" (change/switch) incorrectly replaces the concept of a "race," which is central to the sporting event described.
Olympics → Olympische Spiele → Olympia  	misses → vermisst → verpasst  	semi-final → Halbendschluss → Halbfinale  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Olympische Spiele" (Olympic Games) is a mistranslation of "Olympics," which is better translated as "Olympia" in this context. 	2. "vermisst" (misses, as in "miss a person") does not fit the context of failing to reach a stage in a competition as "verpasst" (misses out on, fails to reach) does.	3. "Halbendschluss" is not a valid German word. The correct word for "semi-final" is "Halbfinale."
1. reign → Erfolgsregel → Siegeszug  	2. quarter-final → Viertel-Ende → Viertelfinale  	3. player → Spieler → Die Weltranglisten-32.  	4. semi-final → Halbal → Halbfinale  	5. tennis tournament → Tennistum → Tennisturniers  	6. Monic → Monic → Monica  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Erfolgsregel" (success rule) is a mistranslation of "reign", which should be "Siegeszug" (victory journey). This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the metaphor significantly.	2. "Viertel-Ende" (quarter end) is a mistranslation of "quarter-final", which should be "Viertelfinale". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes the intended meaning.	3. "Spieler" (player) mistranslates the phrase and position, missing out on conveying "Weltranglisten-32." (world ranked 32).	4. "Halbal" does not convey the intended "semi-final" meaning, which should be "Halbfinale", thus breaking the **Contextual Accuracy** rule.	5. "Tennistum" is a misspelling or incorrect form, failing to deliver "tennis tournament", which should be "Tennisturniers".	6. "Monic" is a spelling error for "Monica", which changes the reference to the player's name in the context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "34)." matches the source sentence "34)." exactly, and since the provided reference translation appears to include additional content that is not present in the source sentence, there are no errors to report based on the lack of context. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Sigemund → Simland → Siegemund  	back problems → Probleme im Rückstand → Rückenproblemen  	serve → Arbeit → Aufschlag  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Simland" is a mistranslation of "Sigemund/Siegemund", incorrectly modifying a name, which affects the sentence meaning.	2. "Probleme im Rückstand" (problems in arrears) wrongly translates "back problems", altering the intended description of physical issues.	3. "Arbeit" (work/task) is a mistranslation of "serve", which is critical in tennis context, changing the meaning of the sentence significantly.
potential → potenzielle → Medaillenhoffnung  	medallist → Medalist → Medaillenhoffnung  	semi-final → Halbende → Vorschlussrunde  		**Explanation:**  	- "potenzielle" is a mistranslation of "potential" in this context, as "Medaillenhoffnung" (medal hope) conveys the intended nuance related to a potential medallist.	- "Medalist" does not match the German "Medaillenhoffnung" used for "medallist," which is more appropriate in this context.	- "Halbende" is a mistranslation of "semi-final", where "Vorschlussrunde" is the correct term in context.
Australian Open → australischen Öffnung → Australian-Open  	winner → Sieger → Gewinnerin  	No. → Nein. → Nr.  		**Explanation:**  	- "australischen Öffnung" (Australian opening) is a mistranslation of "Australian Open", which is a proper noun and should remain as such. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Sieger" (winner) does not match the gender in "Gewinnerin" (female winner) indicated by "the winner" of the Australian Open being a woman. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule due to gender specificity.	- "Nein." (No./no) is a mistranslation of "No." in "No. 10", which is correctly translated as "Nr." in this context. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
win → war → gewonnen  	took → genommen → geholt  
last → vierteljährlichen → Viertelfinale		**Explanation:** The candidate translation contains the word "vierteljährlichen" (quarterly) instead of the proper term "Viertelfinale" (quarter-finals) as seen in the source and reference sentences. This substantially alters the meaning of the sentence, making it a significant translation error.
German-German → deutsch-deutsches → deutsches  	Olympic → Olympisches → olympischen  	semi-final → Halbial → Halbfinale  		**Explanation:**  	1. "deutsch-deutsches" is a literal translation of "German-German," which the reference translates contextually to "deutsches Duo." Though nuanced, the key error lies in the translation of "German-German." This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	2. "Olympisches" is a literal translation of "Olympic," which the reference translates to "olympischen." The mistranslation slightly distorts the context, but we're focusing on word-level correctness.	3. "Halbial" is a mistranslation of "semi-final," which should be "Halbfinale" in German, following the **Identify Mistranslations** rule.
involved → Firmengründungen → steigt ein  	start-up → Firmengründungen → Start-up  	live → lebende → Live  	streaming → Videospiele → Videospielübertragungen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Firmengründungen" (company formations) is a mistranslation for "gets involved" and should be "steigt ein" (gets involved). Furthermore, "Firmengründungen" incorrectly replaces both "start-up" and is repeated in the error list because of its substitution for two different source components.	- "lebende" (living) is a mistranslation of "live" and should be "Live" (as in a live broadcast).	- "Videospiele" (video games) is a mistranslation for "streaming", which should be part of "Videospielübertragungen" (video game streaming).
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. While phrasing and specific word choices vary, the overall meaning, including any significant components of the sentence like "watching other people play video games" and "huge trend," is consistent. Additionally, "möchte" (wants) and "möchte davon profitieren" (wants to profit from this) matches the sense of intention in "wants to profit." Therefore, there are no significant single-word errors that violate the task instructions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Das Technologieunternehmen hat Start-up-Beam gekauft, das sich in diesem Hobby spezialisiert hat." is semantically similar to the source. Though there are differences, such as "Technologieunternehmen" vs "Technologiekonzern" and the use of "auf" vs "in," these do not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence or cause contextual inaccuracies. Therefore, no single-word translation error is present.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While there are structural differences between the candidate and reference translations, the key elements "Microsoft," "how much," "takeover," and the omission of an announcement are maintained without introducing significant translation errors. The term "Mittel" (resources) is used for "money," which is acceptable in this context, and there are no significant deviations impacting the integrity of meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the reference translation in terms of launching a program and having over 100,000 users. The phrases "startete sein Programm" and "ging mit seinem Angebot an den Start" both adequately represent the action of launching a program. There are no single-word translation errors that significantly alter the meaning of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The verbs "zusehen" (watch) and "sich engagieren" (get involved) appropriately capture the intended actions from the source. Both translations, candidate and reference, express the same core ideas, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule as the meaning remains intact. Therefore, no significant single-word errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence accurately. Although there may be slight stylistic differences in phrasing ("erteilen" vs. "aufgeben", "Ausrüstungen" vs. "Ausrüstungsgegenstände"), they do not constitute significant changes to the overall meaning of the sentence. Therefore, no significant single-word mistranslations are present.
No translation errors detected.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Facebook soll auf dem Weg zu globalen Medienveranstaltungen helfen" maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence. The differences in word order between the candidate and reference are acceptable and do not indicate any single-word mistranslations. Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no significant translation error is noted.
ears → Ohren → horcht		**Explanation:** In this context, "ears" should be translated into a phrase that conveys "listening actively" rather than a literal body part. "In den Ohren gehalten" (held in the ears) is incorrect as it doesn't match the idiomatic meaning, while "horcht" (listens) properly captures the intended sense.
employees → Mitarbeiter → Mitarbeiter des Start-ups  	start-up → Unternehmensgründung → Start-ups  	US state → amerikanischen Bundesstaat → US-Bundesstaat  	California's → California's → kalifornischen  	Redmond → Redmond → Redmond, um  	reported → ziehen → mitteilte  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Mitarbeiter der Unternehmensgründung" is more accurately translated as "employees of the start-up" rather than just "Mitarbeiter," since it specifies the context.	2. "Unternehmensgründung" translates to "company founding," which is an incorrect translation of "start-up." The term "Start-up" maintains the original meaning.	3. "amerikanischen Bundesstaat" is a mistranslation of "US state." The term "US-Bundesstaat" is more precise and common in German.	4. "California's" is improperly retained in English, while "kalifornischen" would have been the appropriate translation for "California's."	5. "ziehen" translates to "move," while "reported" should be "mitteilte," meaning "reported" in the context of giving information.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "Übernahme" (takeover), "ändern" (change), and "Kunden" (customers) are correctly translated and maintain the intended meaning of the sentence. The structure and phrasing of the candidate translation differ slightly from the reference, but this does not introduce any mistranslations. Thus, no single-word translation errors are present, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
console → Absperrung → Konsole  		**Explanation:** "Absperrung" (barrier) is a mistranslation of "console". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "barrier" does not fit the context of a gaming console like Xbox.
live-streaming → Lebensumfang → Live-Streamings  	video → Videospiele → Videospielaktivitäten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Lebensumfang" (life scope) is a mistranslation of "live-streaming", misrepresenting the context and violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Videospiele" (video games) is a narrower translation than "Videospielaktivitäten" (video game activities), which includes more than just playing games, but since it changes the specific context of streaming, it also violates **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence in the target language. The phrase "zu den bekannten Plattformen gehören" is a valid and context-appropriate way to translate "well-known platforms include," aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. The meaning remains intact, with no significant changes or mistranslations.
retailer → Einzelhändlern → Onlinehändler  		**Explanation:** "Einzelhändlern" (retailers) is mistranslated as plural, while both the source and reference sentences use the singular form "retailer" and "Onlinehändler", respectively. This error violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes the singular subject to plural, which is contextually incorrect.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "gehört dem Mutterunternehmen von Google Alphabet" accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While it uses different phrasing compared to the reference translation "gehört zur Google-Mutter Alphabet", both translations correctly communicate that YouTube Gaming is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google. The variation in phrasing does not significantly alter the meaning, which aligns with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
enforcement trailer → Vollstreckungshüter → Enforcement Trailer  		**Explanation:** "Vollstreckungshüter" (enforcement warden) is a mistranslation of "enforcement trailer". In this context, "Vollstreckungshüter" suggests a person or guardian rather than a type of trailer or vehicle. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it changes the meaning from an object ("trailer") to a person ("warden").
1. Germany's → deutsche Führung → Deutschlands  	2. speeders → Führung → Raser  	3. speedometers → Geschwindigkeitsmessern → Geschwindigkeitsmesser  	4. federal states → Bundesstaaten → Bundesländern  	5. speed cameras → Geschwindigkeitskameras → Blitzgeräte  	6. catching → die zu schnellen Fahrer zu fangen → Temposünder überführen  		**Explanation:**  	- "deutsche Führung" (German leadership) is a mistranslation for "Germany's". The context implies the speeding drivers, not the leadership, thus the correct term is "Deutschlands" (Germany's) for "Raser" (speeders).	- "Führung" (leadership) is not an appropriate translation for "speeders", which should be "Raser".	- "Geschwindigkeitsmessern" (speedometer) should be "Geschwindigkeitsmesser" to maintain the same meaning in this context.	- "Bundesstaaten" (states) is not the correct translation for "federal states" in the German context; it should be "Bundesländern" (provinces).	- "Geschwindigkeitskameras" (speed cameras) are correctly translated as "Blitzgeräte", which are specific devices for catching speed offenses.	- "die zu schnellen Fahrer zu fangen" (to catch the fast drivers) is a less accurate translation than "Temposünder überführen" (to catch speed offenders), given the context of law enforcement.
enforcement trailer → Durchsetzer → Enforcement Trailer  	made by → Unternehmensform → der Firma  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Durchsetzer" (enforcer) is a mistranslation of "enforcement trailer", which significantly changes the meaning of what action is being discussed.	2. "Unternehmensform" (company form) is a mistranslation of "made by", which confuses the sentence structure and does not convey the intended meaning that Vitronic is the manufacturer from Wiesbaden.
roadworks → Straßenbauarbeiten → Baustellen  	temporary → vorübergehenden → vorübergehendem  		**Explanation:** "Straßenbauarbeiten" translates to "road construction" instead of the intended "roadworks," which should be closer to "Baustellen," a more direct translation in this context. "vorübergehenden" (temporary) should refer to "vorübergehendem" (temporary) as an adjective modifying "Tempolimit," not "Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung," ensuring contextual accuracy.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the general meaning of the source sentence reasonably well. Despite differences in wording, there are no single-word misinterpretations that significantly alter the overall meaning, fully aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
enforcement trailer → Vollstreckungsfahrer → Enforcement Trailer  	autonomous → unabhängig → autark  	battery lasts → Batterie dauert → Akku hält  		**Explanation:**  	- "Vollstreckungsfahrer" (execution driver) is incorrect for "enforcement trailer." This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the translation does not match the intended meaning.	- "unabhängig" (independent) is not a precise translation for "autonomous" and does not convey the intended specific meaning of "self-operating." It should be "autark," which fits the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Batterie dauert" (battery lasts) is not a suitable translation for "battery lasts" in this context. "dauert" does not fit well in the context of battery duration. "Akku hält" is more accurate in conveying the meaning from the source sentence.
laser → lascherer → Laser  	measuring technology → Messtechniken → Messtechnik  	lanes → Strecken → Spuren  	tracked → zur gleichen Zeit → erfasst  		**Explanation:**  	1. "lascherer" (laxer) is a mistranslation of "laser," significantly altering the meaning and precision associated with the technology.  	2. "Messtechniken" (measuring techniques) inaccurately represents "measuring technology"; "Messtechnik" is the specific term for technology here.  	3. "Strecken" (routes) does not capture the meaning of "lanes," which refers specifically to segments within roads; "Spuren" is the correct term.  	4. "zur gleichen Zeit" (at the same time) is a mistranslation of "tracked" in this context, as it omits the action of tracking or capturing data, which is the focus of the sentence.
Variable → verschiedene → Variable	driving → Fahrverbote → Durchfahrts  	bans → Fahrverbote → Durchfahrts  		**Explanation:** 		1. "verschiedene" (various/different) is a mistranslation of "variable". Although both words could seem similar, "verschiedene" changes the intended meaning of "variable speed limits", which refers more specifically to limits that can change rather than simply being different. 		2. and 3. "Fahrverbote" is translated as both "driving" and "bans". This does not capture the full meaning of "Durchfahrtsverbote", which pertains more specifically to bans on passing through certain areas as opposed to just driving bans in general. The specific context suggests a closer meaning to restrictions on transit rather than a restriction on the act of driving, changing the nature of what's being monitored.
powered up → betrieben → hochgefahrenen  	trailer coupling → Anhänger → Anhängerkupplung  	move → verlegen → bewegen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "betrieben" (operated) is a mistranslation of "powered up." The reference uses "hochgefahrenen" (powered up). This change alters the state being described, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Anhänger" (trailer) is incorrect for "trailer coupling." "Anhängerkupplung" is the specific term needed to convey this meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	3. "verlegen" (relocate) is not the correct term for "move" in this context. "bewegen" (move) is more appropriate as per the reference, adhering to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
1. it → sie → er  	**Explanation:** The pronoun "sie" refers to a feminine noun, whereas "it" and "er" refer to masculine nouns. This changes the overall meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		2. measuring → Messung → Messbetrieb  	**Explanation:** "Messung" (measurement) does not fully capture "Messbetrieb" (measuring operation), which reflects a continuous process. This violation is detected under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the context suggests an operation rather than a simple act of measurement.		3. foreigners → Ausländern → Außenhülle  	**Explanation:** "Ausländern" (foreigners) completely alters the meaning when compared to "Außenhülle" (exterior shell), making it a significant error under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:**  	The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Both "darüber hinaus" and "außerdem" are valid translations of "in addition," and "eingebautes Warnsystem" can be understood as functionally equivalent to "eingebaute Alarmanlage" given the context. The key terms "speed camera" ("Geschwindigkeitskamera" vs. "Blitzer") do not change the meaning significantly in the context provided. All elements of the intended message are preserved. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, thus there are no translation errors that significantly change the sentence's meaning.
(according to → nach → nach Angaben von)  	(states → Bundesstaaten → Bundesländern)  		**Explanation:**  	- "nach" is a mistranslation of "according to" when compared with the reference translation "nach Angaben von", which provides the correct context. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Bundesstaaten" (federal states) is a mistranslation of "federal states" when the reference translates it as "Bundesländern". In Germany, "Bundesländer" is the appropriate term for federal states, aligning with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Foreign → Außen → ausländische  	authorities → Behörden → Behörden  	also → auch → auch  	using → verwenden → blitzen  	the new technology → die neue Technologie → mit der neuen Technik  	for → für → für  	speed cameras → Geschwindigkeitskameras → blitzen  	recently → Vor kurzem → Jüngst  	France → Frankreich → Frankreich  	ordered → ordnete an → nachgeordert  	100 → 100 → 100  	after → nachdem → nach  	ordering → bestellt → einer Bestellung  	150 → 150 → 150  	the year before → im Vorjahr → im vergangenen Jahr  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Foreign" was incorrectly translated to "Außen," which doesn't fit the context as well as "ausländische," meaning "foreign," which describes the authorities more accurately.	2. "using" was translated as "verwenden," which means "using" literally, but "blitzen" is the correct contextual translation as it's a specific term meaning to take speed measurements or snap traffic violations with cameras in German.	3. "for speed cameras" was translated as "für Geschwindigkeitskameras," which misses the context of enforcing speed regulations ("blitzen").	4. "recently" was rendered as "Vor kurzem," which is a common translation, but "Jüngst" aligns with the more idiomatic and temporal emphasis found in German, though both could be seen as acceptable.	5. "ordered" translated to "ordnete an" does carry a command-like connotation, while "nachgeordert" fits the context of the follow-up or additional order better.
settle → anlegen → holt  		**Explanation:** "anlegen" (to invest or lay out) is a mistranslation of "settle" which should be "holt" (takes or fetches) in the context of winning or securing a medal, which adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. The candidate word "anlegen" alters the intended meaning as it doesn't fit the sports or medal-winning context.
Great Britain's → Führung → Leistung  	final → Gipfel → Finale  	Stadium → Gipfel → Stadium  		**Explanation:** "Führung" (lead) is a mistranslation of "Great Britain's impressive run", which should convey performance, not leadership. "Gipfel" (summit) is a mistranslation of "final", which refers to the final match, not a peak or summit. "Gipfel" is also incorrectly used instead of "Stadium" for "stadium", the location of the event. These errors violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
handling → Umgang → Handling  	side-stepping → Nebenspiel → Side-Stepping  	support play → Unterstützung → Nachrücken  	running lines → Führung von Linien → Linienlauf		**Explanation:**  	- "Umgang" is a mistranslation of "handling." In the context of sports, "handling" usually involves skillful manipulation or control, better captured by "Handling" in German.	- "Nebenspiel" (literally 'side game') does not convey the same movement-oriented meaning as "Side-Stepping," which is a specific action in sports.	- "Unterstützung" (support) is a broader term that does not specify the dynamic action of "Nachrücken," which involves actively supporting or advancing in play.	- "Führung von Linien" ('leadership/guidance of lines') is longer and less accurate than "Linienlauf," which specifically refers to the running paths in sports.
defeat → Niederlage → Die Niederlage  	shabby → schmutzigen → schlechten  	day → Drittel → vierte  	tournament → Turnkammer → Turnier  		**Explanation:**  	1. **Defeat:** The candidate begins with "Es kam zu einer Niederlage" rather than directly stating "Die Niederlage", which alters the sentence's construction unnecessarily.	2. **Shabby:** The term "schmutzigen" translates to "dirty", which misrepresents "shabby" as it changes the context. It should be "schlechten" meaning "bad" or "not-too-bad".	3. **Day:** The word "Drittel" (third) mistranslates "day" from the source sentence context, referring to the number of medals. The reference translation uses "vierte" (fourth) accurately reflecting the context.	4. **Tournament:** The candidate uses "Turnkammer", which equates to "chamber" instead of "Turnier", which means "tournament". This is a significant error in context.
bruising → brutale → deutliche  	Boks → Bücher → Boks  	semi-final → Halbzeit → Halbfinale  	day → Halbzeit → Tag  	bite → wieder aufleben → zurückfallen  		**Explanation:**  	- "bruising" is mistranslated as "brutale," which means "brutal." The reference uses "deutliche," meaning "clear" or "significant," reflecting the impactful nature of the defeat rather than its physical force.	- "Boks" is mistranslated as "Bücher," which means "books." "Boks" refers to the rugby team in the reference.	- "semi-final" is mistranslated as "Halbzeit," meaning "half-time." It should be "Halbfinale" as in the reference.	- "day" is mistranslated as "Halbzeit," meaning "half-time." It should be "Tag" for "day" in the reference.	- "bite" is mistranslated as "wieder aufleben," which means "to come alive again." The correct translation should reflect the sense of consequence, "zurückfallen," meaning "come back" in this context.
fit as a fiddle → einen Fuß → in Bestform		**Explanation:** The German phrase "einen Fuß" (a foot) is a mistranslation of the English idiom "fit as a fiddle," which is correctly translated as "in Bestform" (in top form). This changes the meaning of the sentence, hence it was identified as a significant mistranslation according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Briton → Brite → Brite  	head coach → Kopftuch → Cheftrainer  		**Explanation:** "Briton" is correctly translated to "Brite" in the candidate translation, showing no error for this word. However, "Kopftuch" (headscarf) is a mistranslation of "head coach", significantly altering the meaning of the sentence as it confuses the profession with a garment, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The correct translation in the reference is "Cheftrainer", and thus the error is: head coach → Kopftuch → Cheftrainer.
GB → BIP → GB  		**Explanation:** "BIP" (GDP) is a mistranslation of "GB" (Great Britain). This error significantly alters the meaning of the sentence since "BIP" does not relate to "GB". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the reference is to Great Britain, not gross domestic product.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although there are slight differences in wording, such as "bei den Adelaide Sevens" and "im Adelaide Sevens," the meaning remains intact. Both "vor acht Jahren" and "unter Ryan" are correctly translated, and "jedes Spiel verloren" fully captures the essence of "lost every game." Therefore, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no significant translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Hier haben sie nur eine verloren" effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence "Here, they lost just one." The word choices are alternate grammatically correct expressions that fit the context, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Both candidate and reference translations carry the intended meaning without significant semantic deviation.
hammering → Hin und Her → Schlappe  	startling → erschreckend → erstaunlich  		**Explanation:** "Hin und Her" (back and forth) is a mistranslation of "hammering," which is crucial to understanding what will "hurt" in the context. "Erschreckend" (scary/frightening) is a mistranslation of "startling," altering the positive connotation intended in relation to "progress." This adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules.
magnificently → wunderbar → wundervoll  	tackles → Adressen → Angriffe  		**Explanation:**  	1. "wunderbar" (wonderful) is a mistranslation of "magnificently". While both words convey a positive start, "wunderbar" lacks the grandeur implied by "magnificently." This qualifies under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	2. "Adressen" (addresses) is a mistranslation of "tackles". In this context, "Adressen" does not fit the sports terminology, making it a clear error as per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Angriffe" (attacks) is the appropriate translation in the context of sports.
running → einlief → laufen  	moving → Umsiedlungsbussen → fahrende  	went → stiegen → gingen  	dived → aufging → rüberhechtete  		**Explanation:**  	1. "einlief" (entered) is a mistranslation of "running", because it changes the imagery from an active motion to simply entering. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Umsiedlungsbussen" (relocation buses) is a mistranslation of "moving buses". This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, as "fahrende" describes the movement appropriately.	3. "stiegen" (rose/climbed) is a mistranslation of "went" in the context of a score advancing, which needs "gingen" for **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.	4. "aufging" (rose/opened) is a mistranslation of "dived". The specific imagery of a dive needs to be respected for the sentence to convey the correct action, aligning with the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
wing → Flügel → Angriff  	converted → umgebaut → umwandelte  		**Explanation:** "Flügel" (wing) is a mistranslation in this sports context where "Angriff" (attack) better represents the intended action. The word "umgebaut" (rebuilt) represents a construction-related context which is different from the intended meaning of "converted" in a sports scoring context, where "umwandelte" (converted) is more appropriate. These mistranslations violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
12-0 → 120 → 12-0	had → hatten → hat	touched → berührt → angefasst		**Explanation:** 	- "120" is a mistranslation of "12-0"; the digits are incorrectly combined into a larger number.	- "hatten" (had - plural) is incorrect because "GB" is singular in this context, and should be "hat" (had - singular).	- "berührt" (touched) and "angefasst" (handled) are synonyms in this context. However, since both indicate contact with the ball, no meaningful error is present here according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule and the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Thus, this word is not flagged as an error.
mitigated → beschlagnahmen → erzielen		**Explanation:** "beschlagnahmen" (to seize/confiscate) is a mistranslation of "scoring" (erzielen). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it results in a significant deviation from the intended meaning of sporting context where a score is made.
seven → in → in der siebten  	On → ist → In der siebten Minute  	touched → angeschnitten → lete  	corner → Ecke → rechten Ecke  	GB → BB → GB  	17-0 to the bad → 17-0 zum Schlechten → 0-17 für GB  		**Explanation:**  	1. "On seven minutes" is mistranslated as "in sieben Minuten," which incorrectly suggests a future action. The correct reference is "In der siebten Minute," indicating the time elapsed.	2. "touched" is mistranslated as "angeschnitten," which means "cut." The correct term for a sports context is "lete" for a touchdown.	3. "corner" is translated as "Ecke," but it misses the specificity of "right corner" which is "rechten Ecke" in the reference.	4. "GB" is mistranslated as "BB," altering the named entity.	5. "17-0 to the bad" is mistranslated to "17-0 zum Schlechten," which misrepresents the score context. "0-17 für GB" accurately reflects the intended meaning in the reference.
restart → Anfang → Wiederanpfiff		**Explanation:** "Anfang" (beginning) is a mistranslation of "restart", which in the context of a sports game typically translates to "Wiederanpfiff", meaning the resumption of play after a stoppage. This is an error in **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** as the word does not fit the intended context.
GB tackling → GBB → Tacklings  	line → Grenze → Linie  	score → - → ein Tor zu machen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "GBB" is incorrect since "GB tackling" translates to "Tacklings des GB." "GBB" does not convey the intended meaning.	2. "Grenze" (border) is a mistranslation of "line," which is in the context of sports ("Linie" is accurate).	3. The candidate sentence omits the concept of "to score," thus failing to capture the meaning of "um ein Tor zu machen."
conversion → Umstellung → Umwandlung  	break → 20 Uhr → Pause  		**Explanation:** "Umstellung" (change/adjustment) is a mistranslation of "conversion", which should be "Umwandlung" as used in the reference sentence. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because "Umstellung" conveys a different action than the intended "conversion" within the context of a game score. "20 Uhr" (8 PM) is an incorrect translation of "break" which should be "Pause" in the context of a halftime break in a game. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Fiji → Fidschi → Fiji  	GB → BB → GB  	7s → 7-mal → 7  		**Explanation:**  	- "Fidschi" is a valid translation for "Fiji," but given the reference retains "Fiji," it might lead to less familiar recognition. Contextual preference in the reference sentence suggests maintaining the original name. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "BB" is an apparent mistranslation of "GB," which changes the subject of the second part of the sentence. Following the **Identify Mistranslations** rule.	- "7-mal" (7 times) wrongly conveys the meaning of "7s" (referring to Rugby Sevens). This adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the sporting context, which is significant.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "So ist es nun einmal" and the reference translation "So ist es auch" both capture the intended meaning of the source sentence "Which is pretty much how it is." The variations are acceptable and do not significantly change the meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Additionally, both translations are contextually appropriate, fulfilling the requirement to **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully**.
GB → BB → GB  	plugged → gestolpert → schloss  	dam → Fidschi-Damm → Lücke  		**Explanation:**  		1. "BB" is a mistranslation of "GB" (Great Britain), which is incorrect because they are different entities. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	  	2. "gestolpert" (stumbled) is a mistranslation of "plugged," which means to close or seal something in this context. This mistranslation changes the sentence's intended meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.		3. "Fidschi-Damm" (Fijian dam) is a mistranslation of "Fijian Lücke" (Fijian gap), which is more metaphorical in this context. This mistranslation changes the imagery and intended meaning of the source sentence.
(try → Versuch → Versuch)	(GB → GBB → GB)	(touching down → trat → machte einen Touchdown)	(South Sea Islanders → Südseilern → Südseeinsulaner)	(stands → Ständen → Tribüne)		**Explanation:** 	1. "GBB" in the candidate translation should be "GB", as indicated by both the source and reference sentences.	2. "trat" (kicked) is not a proper translation for "touching down", which in this context means "machte einen Touchdown".	3. "Südseilern" is an incorrect translation for "South Sea Islanders". The correct term is "Südseeinsulaner".	4. "Ständen" is a mistranslation of "stands", which in this sports context should be translated as "Tribüne", aligning with the reference translation.	   	The mistranslations violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, as they significantly alter the meaning of the original sentence.
joyful → Freude → spielerischen		**Explanation:** "Freude" (joy) is a mistranslation of "joyful" in this context. The term "spielerischen" (playful) better captures the sense of "joyful approach" as intended in the source and reference sentences. This meets the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** guidelines by identifying a word that changes the intended meaning significantly.
dying → verstorbenen → letzten  	moments → Augenblicken → Sekunden  	iced → gepflastert → i-Tüpfelchen gesetzt  	cake → Fidschi-Kuchen → i-Tüpfelchen  	celebrated → gefeiert → gesetzt  		**Explanation:**   	1. "verstorbenen" translates to "deceased" instead of "dying," and "letzten" (last) fits the context of the final moments.  	2. "Augenblicken" (moments) is a literal translation, but "Sekunden" (seconds) is more precise in the given context.  	3. "gepflastert" translates to "paved" which is inaccurate in this case, whereas "setzte das i-Tüpfelchen" (put the icing on) closely captures the meaning of "iced" in this metaphorical sense.  	4. "Fidschi-Kuchen" (Fijian cake) is not the intended expression; here "i-Tüpfelchen" is a metaphor and it's not about an actual cake.  	5. "gefeiert" means "celebrated," but "gesetzt" is a more appropriate choice for the action described when referring to attempts or tries in sports.
whistle → Weile → Pfiff  	went → ging zurück → ertönte  	turf → Höhle → Rasen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Weile" (while) is a mistranslation of "whistle", which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "while" does not match the meaning of "whistle".	- "ging zurück" (went back) is a mistranslation of "went", which should have been "ertönte" (sounded), violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Höhle" (cave) is a mistranslation of "turf", violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "cave" does not match the intended meaning related to the playing surface.
Fiji → Fidschi-Fidschi → Fiji  	Japan → Kleid → Japan  	edged → Kleider → drängte  	tight → engstirnigen → knappen  	semi-final → Halbsalz → Halbfinalmatch  	conversion → Umwandlung → Umwandlung  	difference → Unterschieds → Differenz  		**Explanation:**	- "Fidschi-Fidschi" is a mistranslation for "Fiji," repeated unnecessarily and disruptively.	- "Kleid" and "Kleider" appear inappropriately, where "Japan" and "edged" should be referred, respectively.	- "engstirnigen" means narrow-minded, but in context, "tight" intended a close match, which "knappen" correctly conveys.	- "Halbsalz" (half-salt) appears nonsensically instead of "semi-final" in the context.	- "Umwandlung" is a correct translation for "conversion," and "Unterschieds" is not wildly different but doesn't precisely represent "difference" as in the reference. However, since "Umwandlung" is already well-translated, "difference" → "Unterschieds" doesn't need reporting, and the initial focus maybe contained in comparing semantics of whole sentence structures rather than individual words unless significant meaning shift occurred.
Boks → Bücher → Boks  	footwork → Fußballwerk → Fußarbeit  	line → Grenze → Linie  		**Explanation:** "Bücher" (books) is a mistranslation of "Boks," which refers to a term specific to a rugby team. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it changes the subject. "Fußballwerk" (football work) is a mistranslation of "footwork," which alters the intended meaning of the impressive movement, violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule. "Grenze" (border/limit) is a mistranslation of "line" in the context of breaking through a defensive line, significantly changing the meaning.
brilliant → verspäteter → brilliantes  	tackle → Angriff → Tackling  	late → verspäteter → spätes  	team → Mannschaft → Teams  		**Explanation:** 		1. "verspäteter" (delayed) is a mistranslation of "brilliant" in this context. It affects the meaning since "brilliant" refers to the quality, not the timing of a tackle.		2. "Angriff" (attack) is a mistranslation of "tackle". This changes the context significantly since a "tackle" is a specific action in sports, different from a general "attack".		3. "verspäteter" (delayed) is also a mistranslation of "late". While "late" in the context of sports typically means happening toward the end of the game rather than not being on time, "verspäteter" implies the latter.		4. "Mannschaft" (team) is used, but with the context of the English "15-aside team" missing its specificity which is better translated as "Teams". Here, maintaining the term "Teams" keeps the original meaning intact.
cancer → Kraftomnibusverkehr → Krebs  	rowing → ruhigen Sieg → Rudersieg  		**Explanation:** "Kraftomnibusverkehr" (bus service) is not contextually appropriate for "cancer", affecting the intended meaning. "Ruhigen Sieg" (quiet victory) was used instead of "Rudersieg" (rowing victory), which alters the sport in question, resulting in a significant change of meaning. Both errors are identified based on the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence, and the variations between it and the reference are stylistic rather than semantic. The phrase "und das ist etwas" is a valid expression of "and that is saying something," keeping the contextual significance intact. Thus, there are no significant single-word translation errors to report.
first stroke → ersten Angriff → ersten Ruderschlag  	punishing heaves → Höfe, die die Geschichte bestrafen → harte Hieve  	found → waren es → fanden  	Heater → Heater → Heather  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Angriff" (attack) is a mistranslation of "stroke" in the context of rowing, where "Ruderschlag" is the correct term.	2. "Höfe, die die Geschichte bestrafen" (yards that punish history) is a mistranslation of "punishing heaves," where "harte Hieve" conveys the intended meaning of strenuous rowing strokes.	3. "waren es" (were) misses the reference to finding meaning, which "fanden" (found) captures.	4. "Heater" is a typographical error or incorrect representation of "Heather."
pulling → Ohrfeige → am Ruder  	coach → Bus → Trainers  	present → jemals anwesend → allgegenwärtig  	powered → anboten → ruderten  	women's pairs → Paares der Frauen → Zweier ohne Steuerfrau  	scale → vergrößerten → legten  		**Explanation:**  	- "Ohrfeige" (slap) is a mistranslation of "pulling", whereas "am Ruder" (at the helm) accurately conveys the rowing action.	- "Bus" (bus) is incorrectly used for "coach", the latter of which refers to a trainer, hence "Trainers" is correct.	- "jemals anwesend" (ever present) does not capture the always present sense conveyed by "allgegenwärtig", which translates "present" in context.	- "anboten" (offered) is a mistranslation of "powered"; the context of rowing to victory is better captured by "ruderten" (rowed).	- "Paares der Frauen" (pairs of the women) does not properly translate "women's pairs", which refers to a specific rowing event, "Zweier ohne Steuerfrau" (two without coxswain).	- "vergrößerten" (enlarged) is a mistranslation of "scale"; here, "legten" (set) captures the sense of reaching a new height or standard in the records.
dominance → Dominanz → Dominanz  	outing → ungeschoren → ungeschlagener  	unprecedented → einmalig → beispiellos  		**Explanation:** "Dominanz" is a correct translation for "dominance" and should not be listed as an error despite being mentioned. "Ungeschoren" translates to "unscathed" or "unshorn," rather than "ungeschlagen" (unbeaten), affecting the meaning significantly, violating **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**. "Einmalig" means "unique" or "once," not "unprecedented," which changes the context, violating **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.
see → kratzen → sehen  	skating → kratzen → gleiten  	swans → Schwanen → Schwänen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "kratzen" (scratch) is used in place of both "see" and "skating", which is contextually incorrect. The act of "skating" implies smooth, fluid movement, whereas "kratzen" implies a rough action, which does not fit the smoothness implied by "skating".	2. "Schwanen" (singular form of "swan") is a mistranslation of "swans" (plural "Schwäne"), impacting the imagery of multiple swans.
coach → Kraftomnibusses → Trainer		**Explanation:** "Kraftomnibusses" (coach as in a bus) is a mistranslation for "coach" (the person who trains athletes). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the intended meaning refers to a person, not a vehicle.
touch and go → berührt und geht → riskant		**Explanation:** "berührt und geht" is a word-for-word translation of "touch and go," but it does not convey the idiomatic meaning of an uncertain or risky situation, which is correctly translated to "riskant." This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the literal translation does not fit the intended context.
bladder → Brotkrebs → Blasenkrebs  	operate → arbeiten → operierbar  		**Explanation:** "Brotkrebs" (bread cancer) is a mistranslation of "bladder cancer", which creates a nonsensical meaning in context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "arbeiten" (work) is a mistranslation of "operate", as it changes the action performed. This falls under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule since it changes the medical context of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Wenn sie es nicht tun, geht es überall." is close enough to the reference translation "Wenn Sie das nicht tun, breitet er sich überall aus." Both convey the intended meaning of the original sentence, even though "geht" (goes) and "breitet sich aus" (spreads) are slightly different, the meaning is retained in context. Therefore, no significant single-word translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Das wäre eine ziemlich schlechte Situation gewesen." closely aligns with the reference translation "Es wäre ein ziemlich schlimme Situation gewesen." Both "schlechte" and "schlimme" can convey a negative situation, and "das" and "es" are both valid translations for "it" in this context. Consequently, there are no significant single-word translation errors to report.
outlook → Prognose → Ausblick  		**Explanation:** "Prognose" (forecast) is a mistranslation of "outlook" in this context, as "outlook" refers to a perspective or view rather than a prediction or forecast. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules because the term used in the candidate translation does not align with the intended meaning of the source sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation matches the reference translation exactly. There are no single-word translation errors present, and the meaning retained is consistent with the source sentence. This satisfies the instructions to focus on meaningful errors, and none are present here.
fortunate → das Glück → Glücklich  	start → Beginn → Anfang  	out of season → zu Beginn der Saison → außerhalb der Saison  		**Explanation:** "das Glück" (the luck) mistakenly interprets "fortunate" as a noun rather than directly translating its adjective form. "Beginn" translates "start" but "Anfang" captures the intended timing more naturally in this context. "zu Beginn der Saison" (at the start of the season) is a mistranslation of "out of season," which alters the meaning significantly by implying the treatment started within the season rather than outside it.
needed → musste → benötigte  	paid → bezahlt → Geld  	better → schneller → besser  		**Explanation:** "musste" is a mistranslation of "needed" as it implies obligation rather than necessity. "bezahlt" (paid) is a mistranslation of "Geld" (money), changing the subject of payment from getting paid to wanting money. "schneller" (faster) is a mistranslation of "besser" (better), altering the intended meaning of recovering or improving in health.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The word "It" is translated as "Das" in the candidate translation and "Es" in the reference translation. Both "Das" and "Es" can be acceptable translations for "It" depending on the context, especially when referring to something specific or in general terms. Since the meaning remains clear and contextually appropriate, there are no significant single-word translation errors to report, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
20ft → 200 → 20 Fuß		**Explanation:** "200" in the candidate translation is a mistranslation of "20ft." This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the original sentence provides specific numerical distances, and the translation fails to preserve one of these numbers accurately. The use of the number "200" instead of "20" significantly changes the distance being discussed.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "fängt an" and "beginnt" are acceptable translations of "starts off" in this context. Since the meaning is preserved, there are no translation errors to report according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
rowing → Rogen → Rudern  	journey → Reise → Herausforderung  		**Explanation:** "Rogen" is a mistranslation of "rowing," which should be "Rudern" in German as it refers to the activity. "Reise" is a mistranslation of "journey" in this context, which is more accurately translated as "Herausforderung" (challenge) to convey the abstract nature of the journey metaphorically. This adheres to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
immediacy → unmittelbaren → Unmittelbarkeit  	had → hatten → verbrachte  	nervy → Nervenmorgen → nervenaufreibenden  		**Explanation:**  	1. "unmittelbaren" (immediate) is a mistranslation of "immediacy". It changes the grammatical structure and meaning. The correct translation is "Unmittelbarkeit", which preserves the expression of the situation's proximity.	2. "hatten" (had) is used in place of "verbrachte" (spent), which misrepresents the singular subject "Williams" and introduces an incorrect plural form.	3. "Nervenmorgen" is a literal and incorrect attempt at translating "nervy." The original concept relates to feeling nervous or on edge, better captured by "nervenaufreibenden" in the reference.
captain → Kapitän → Hauptmann  	tour → Reise → Einsatz  		**Explanation:** "Kapitän" (captain) is not the correct rank translation for "Hauptmann" in a military context, and "Reise" (journey) incorrectly conveys the military context intended by "Einsatz" (mission/tour of duty). These are significant errors in rank and context and change the specific meaning of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. "Sie" (it) and "Es" (it) both refer to the subject and fit contextually. Both "wieviel" and "wie viel" correctly express "how much" in context. The structure and meaning of the sentence are maintained, so following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no errors are highlighted.
three → vor → drei  		**Explanation:** "vor" (ago) is a mistranslation of "three" in this context, which changes the meaning from describing the duration as "three years" to suggesting a specific time "three years ago." This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it alters the intended temporal context.
coach → Bus → Trainer  		**Explanation:** "Bus" (bus) is a mistranslation of "coach", which refers to a person who trains others, not a vehicle. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "Bus" significantly alters the intended meaning in this context. The rest of the translation maintains the original sentence's meaning, so no other errors are reported.
train → Zug → Trainieren  	coach → Bus → Trainer  		**Explanation:** "Zug" (train, as in a locomotive) is a mistranslation of "train" (as in exercising), which fundamentally alters the context of the activity. "Bus" (bus) is a mistranslation of "coach" (as in a sports coach), which also changes the intended meaning of having a mentor or instructor, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.
punishing → Strafrhythmus → harten  	rivals → Rivalen → Gegner  		**Explanation:** "Strafrhythmus" (punishing rhythm) implies a different meaning focused on punishment, which is not exactly synonymous with "harten" (hard), the intended meaning in this context. "Rivalen" (rivals) mistranslates to "Gegner" (opponents), although close, they carry different connotations in certain competitive contexts, thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
crews → Besatzungen → Teams  	close → schließen → aufzuschließen  	were → waren → hatten  		**Explanation:** 	- "Besatzungen" (crews) is more commonly used for ship or aircraft crews, whereas "Teams" (teams) is more accurate for rowing teams in this context, aligning with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "schließen" is a direct translation of "close", but in this context, it changes the intended meaning. "aufzuschließen" (to catch up) is the correct term, addressing the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "waren" (were) does not fit the intended meaning because the original sentence indicates possession of reserve; "hatten" (had) aligns with this meaning, confirming the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Wir waren im Moment sehr präsent" conveys a similar meaning to the reference translation "Wir waren sehr im Moment gefangen." Both translations express the concept of being fully immersed or present in the current moment. Therefore, according to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, no meaningful mistranslation occurs even though the exact wording differs.
Helen → Helsen → Helen  	stay → Bleibt → bleib  		**Explanation:** "Helsen" is a typographical error of "Helen," which changes the name. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it misnames the person. "Bleibt" (plural "stay") is used instead of "bleib" (singular "stay"), causing a contextual mismatch based on the reference. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it alters the intended grammatical context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "hinreißen zu lassen" and the reference translation "mitreißen zu lassen" both convey the idea of "getting carried away" in German. While the words are different, they do not significantly change the context or meaning of the sentence. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as both translations retain the intended message.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the meaning of the source sentence. The use of "Anfang" (start) and "Erstaunliches" (amazing) are contextually appropriate alternatives to "Start" and "Tolles" found in the reference. These synonyms do not significantly change the sentence's meaning, which follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Additionally, the sentence structure conveys the same overall message, so no errors are reported.
fireworks → Feuerwerkskörper → Feuerwerk  	row → Streit → Ergebnis  		**Explanation:** "Feuerwerkskörper" is a mistranslation of "fireworks"; "Feuerwerk" is a better translation in this context, meaning the spectacle rather than physical items. "Streit" (argument/dispute) is a mistranslation of "row" in this context, where "row" refers to achievement or performance, so "Ergebnis" (result) fits better.
year → Jahr → Auszeit  		**Explanation:** "Jahr" (year) is a mistranslation of "Auszeit" (time off). The source sentence implies taking time off (like a sabbatical) rather than simply needing a year. This alteration significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
month → Monat → Woche  	attend → hier sein → erscheinen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Monat" (month) is a mistranslation of "week", which changes the time reference. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it misrepresents the schedule.	2. "hier sein" (be here) is a mistranslation of "attend". The phrase "erscheinen" (appear) is a closer fit for formal attendance, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Vorerst möchte sie nur diesen Augenblick genießen." maintains the same overall meaning as the source and reference sentences. The choice of "Vorerst" for "For now" and "diesen Augenblick" for "the moment" are valid alternate translations, which fall within acceptable variations. Thus, there are no significant translation errors to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Ich wollte nicht sagen, dass dies mein letztes Rennen war." is effectively equivalent to the reference translation "Ich wollte nicht sagen, dass das mein letztes Rennen war." Both "dies" and "das" can be used in this context without causing a significant change in the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, there are no detected mistranslations.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the reference translation, and "zu viel" and "zuviel" are both valid variants for "too much" in this context. The sentence retains the intended meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
champion → Verfechter → Olympiasiegerin  		**Explanation:** "Verfechter" (advocate/supporter) is a mistranslation of "champion" in the context of being an Olympic champion. This significantly alters the intended meaning.
stressed → betont → gestresst  		**Explanation:** "betont" (emphasized) is a mistranslation of "stressed", which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence. This is a clear violation of the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it misrepresents the emotional state described in the source sentence.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Das dauerte etwa vier Minuten" captures the meaning of the source sentence well. The difference in using "Das" instead of "Hier" does not significantly change the meaning and is an acceptable variation. Hence, it follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, resulting in no identifiable translation errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the meaning of the source sentence in German. While "so" is omitted in the candidate, the core meaning is preserved, and the phrase "viel besser" (much better) accurately conveys the intended sentiment. The error does not significantly alter the intended sense, thus no meaningful translation error is detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although the candidate translation "31 Jahre lang ein klares Beispiel geben" (for 31 years give a clear example) uses a different structure from "31 Jahre lang vorbildlich für Klarheit gesorgt" (for 31 years ensured clarity exemplary), the overall meaning of setting a clear example over a period is still maintained. Therefore, there are no meaningful single-word errors, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
(Managing Director → geschäftsführende Direktor → Geschäftsführer)  	"Veitensteingruppe" → "Vetensteingto" → "Veitensteingruppe"  	is retiring → ist in den Ruhestand getreten → geht in den Ruhestand  		**Explanation:**  	- "geschäftsführende Direktor" is a less precise translation of "Managing Director" compared to "Geschäftsführer," which more accurately conveys the official title within the organizational hierarchy, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Vetensteingto" is a mistranslation of the proper noun "Veitensteingruppe," altering the name significantly, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "ist in den Ruhestand getreten" is a past tense and slightly different phrasing rather than "geht in den Ruhestand," which is a present continuous tense more aligned with "is retiring," following **Focus on Single-Word Errors** to identify the key deviation.
association → Assoziation → Verband		**Explanation:** "Assoziation" is a mistranslation of "Association" in this context. The more appropriate term in the reference is "Verband," which aligns with the typical usage in an organizational context. The rest of the candidate sentence sufficiently conveys the intended meaning, so no additional errors are listed.
Franconian → französischer → fränkischer  		**Explanation:** "französischer" (French) is a mistranslation of "Franconian", which refers to a region in Germany. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it changes the geographical context significantly.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While the candidate translation does not exactly match the reference translation, the meaning is preserved. "Die Vereinigung" (the association) accurately reflects context, and "bayerischen Rundfunks" (Bavarian radio) covers the intended meaning of "des Bayerischen Rundfunks". No meaningful single-word errors that significantly change the intended message were detected, in accordance with the rules.
government → Regierung → Regierung  	Lower Franconia → Niederfrankreich → Unterfranken  	Association → Verband → Zweckverband  		**Explanation:**		1. "Niederfrankreich" is a mistranslation of "Lower Franconia." The correct region name in German is "Unterfranken," adhering to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by highlighting the most significant part of the misinterpretation.	   	2. "Verband" is a mistranslation of "Association" in this specific context. The more precise term used in the reference is "Zweckverband," which more accurately describes the association in question. 		Note: The word "Regierung" is correctly translated in both candidate and reference, so no error is detected for "government." However, it appears here to ensure clarity in discerning the broader structure of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation adequately renders the meaning of the source sentence. The translation of "setting an example for the entirety of Bavaria" to "beispielgebend für ganz Bayern" captures the essence, and there is no significant word that changes the intended meaning. The names and slightly different phrases used do not violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as the overall message remains intact.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. Although the structure varies, no single words are mistranslated in a way that changes the original meaning or context, complying with the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence within its context. "Er ist jetzt mit 65 Jahren in den Ruhestand getreten" accurately matches the sentiment of "He has now gone into retirement at the age of 65", maintaining correct meaning and context, thereby following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Veitensteingruppe → Vetensteinglied → Veitensteingruppe  	Breitbrunn → Brunn → Breitbrunn  	hamlets → Hämmer → Weiler  		**Explanation:**	- "Vetensteinglied" is a mistranslation of "Veitensteingruppe." It is crucial to maintain proper names correctly, as mistranslation could lead to confusion. This addresses the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Brunn" is a mistranslation of "Breitbrunn," which is a specific place name and needs to be correctly translated to maintain factual accuracy, which is another aspect of **Ensure Contextual Accuracy.**	- "Hämmer" (hammers) is a mistranslation of "hamlets" (small settlements). This significantly changes the meaning and does not fit the context, aligning with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively communicates the membership status of the communes and municipality as intended in the source sentence. The choice of using "Gemeinde" for both communes and municipality aligns with the contextual and semantic meaning, despite the reference using "Stadt" for Baunach. Given the interchangeable use in general context and lack of significant semantic shift, this aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
additional → zusätzliche → weitere  		**Explanation:** The word "zusätzliche" (additional) translates the source word "additional" to German. However, in the given context, "weitere" (further or more) is the appropriate translation used in the reference to convey the intended meaning. This mistake alters the nuance of the sentence and follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		communes → Gemeinden → Gemeinden		**Explanation:** "Gemeinden" (meaning communes or municipalities) is used twice in the candidate, but the source uses two distinct terms: "municipalities and communes". The reference translation condenses and aligns better with "Städte und Gemeinden" (cities and communes), and while "Gemeinden" can cover both, the repetition in the candidate shows a lack of distinction as seen in the reference. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
1. chairman → Vorsitzende → Vorsitzende  	2. mayoress → Bürgermeister → Bürgermeisterin  	3. Ruper → Ruper → Rupert  	4. water officer → Wasseroffizier → Wasserwart  	5. Managing Director → Leitung → Geschäftsführer  	6. Association → Verband → Zweckverband  		**Explanation:**		1. "Vorsitzende" instead of "Vorsitzender" correctly corresponds to "chairman" when referencing a female in the role, maintaining consistency with "Bürgermeisterin" (mayoress). The gender discrepancy is noted.	2. "Bürgermeister" translates to "mayor," whereas "Bürgermeisterin" specifically refers to a female mayor, like in the reference. This is a gender-specific mistranslation.	3. "Ruper" is a typographical error for "Rupert," the correct name as per the reference sentence.	4. "Wasseroffizier" is a literal translation but does not align with the usual term "Wasserwart," which captures the intended role.	5. "Leitung" can mean "leadership" but here it is used as a title mistakenly translated for "Managing Director," which in this context should be "Geschäftsführer."	6. "Verband" is a general term for "association," while "Zweckverband" specifically refers to a type of association or district, which fits the context more accurately.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the meaning of the source sentence adequately, maintaining the overall sense of varied tasks and responsibilities. There are no single-word mistranslations that significantly alter the meaning or context of the original sentence. This follows the "Handle Ambiguity Carefully" rule, as minor differences in phrasing do not constitute significant errors.
spring → Frühlings → Brunnen  	elevated → gewachsenen → Hochbehälter  		**Explanation:** "Frühlings" (spring, like the season) is a mistranslation of "spring" (water source), which in the context of the sentence should be "Brunnen" (well/spring referring to water). "Gewachsenen" (grown) is a mistranslation of "elevated", which should be "Hochbehälter" (elevated tanks) to correctly convey the meaning in this context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the overall meaning of the source sentence. Though there are stylistic and phrasing differences between the candidate and reference sentences, they do not substantively alter the meaning in a way that necessitates marking translation errors. The core concepts and message about "water" and "drinking water" as vital elements are accurately conveyed.
loyal → loyalen → treuen  	upstanding → aufhaltenden → korrekten  		**Explanation:** "loyalen" is a mistranslation of "loyal"; while it shares a root, the context in German typically uses "treuen" for "loyal" in this context. "aufhaltenden" (stopping/halting) is a mistranslation of "upstanding," which should be "korrekten" in the context of describing service. These violations affect the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively captures the meaning and context of the source sentence. Words like "Herz und seine Seele" and "Wasserversorgungsverband" align with intended meanings such as "heart and soul" and "Water Supply Association" respectively. Although there are stylistic differences compared to the reference, the main message is conveyed accurately, so no significant single-word translation errors are present.
Veitensteingruppe's → Ventinsteing-Gruppe → Veitensteingruppe  	weeks → Wochen → wenigen  	Forum → Wasserforum → Wasserforum des Bezirks Unterfranken  		**Explanation:**  	- "Ventinsteing-Gruppe" is a mistranslation of "Veitensteingruppe". It appears as if it might be a typographical error, but contextually it changes the name of the group, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Wochen" (weeks) instead of "wenigen" (few) changes the perceived time frame, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Although "einigen" is partially correct for "few", contextually "wenigen" is a closer match.	- "Wasserforum" is used correctly, but it lacks the equivalent of "des Bezirks Unterfranken" from the reference, which provides a more specific and accurate context. Since this partially impacts comprehension by omitting "District of Lower Franconia" (Bezirks Unterfranken), it suggests a compounding error even though it matches the source "Water Forum".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence uses "große" (considerable) to translate "considerable", which maintains the intended meaning of significant appreciation. The rest of the words ("Anerkennung und Lob" for "appreciation and praise") match both the meaning and context of the source and reference sentences. Thus, there are no significant translation errors present.
Wasserbeamten → Wasserwart → Wasserwart  		**Explanation:** "Wasserbeamten" (water officer) is a mistranslation of "Wasserwart" (water attendant/warden). Although both terms can be similar, "Wasserwart" is specifically used in the reference translation and the context, closely matching the source term given its importance in the sentence. Thereby, it significantly alters the intended meaning, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
loyal → loyaler → treuer  	lad → Land → Knappe  		**Explanation:** The word "loyal" is correctly identified, but the German translation "loyaler" does not match the more contextually appropriate "treuer" for this context. "Lad" is mistranslated as "Land" (which means "country" or "land"), which is a significant error, as the intended word "Knappe" refers to a young male or assistant in this context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Land" does not fit the meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The word "Gemeinsam" (together) is a valid synonym of "Zusammen" in German and does not alter the meaning of the sentence. This satisfies the **Acceptable Variations** rule.
high point → Höhepunkt → Höhepunkte  	spring → Frühjahrs → Brunnenbau  	Association → Assoziation → Zweckverband  		**Explanation:** The translation errors detected involve key terms in the sentence:	- "Höhepunkt" (singular) is used instead of "Höhepunkte" (plural), significantly changing the meaning in this context, violating the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.	- "Frühjahrs" (spring) is a mistranslation of "Brunnenbau" (construction of the spring, referring to a well), which changes the meaning entirely, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Assoziation" (association) is a mistranslation of "Zweckverband" (a more specific type of association, such as a utility district), which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it changes the intended meaning.
largest → größte → größte  	shift → Schieflage → Einsatz  	pipe → Pipeline → Rohrbruch  	elevated → gehobenen → Hochbehälter  		**Explanation:**  	1. "largest" is translated as "größte", which is correct in this instance, so no issue here. However, we can address the error related to "shift".	2. "shift" is mistranslated as "Schieflage", which does not convey the meaning of "Einsatz" (operation/shift) as used in this context.	3. "pipe" is mistranslated as "Pipeline", which incorrectly specifies the type as a pipeline, while "Rohrbruch" accurately translates to "pipe" (break is assumed contextually).	4. "elevated" is mistranslated as "gehobenen", while the context refers to "Hochbehälter" (elevated tank), a specific structure, not just something that is simply raised or elevated.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate translation successfully conveys the essential meaning of the source sentence: working through the night at minus 17 degrees to ensure water delivery to the locality. There are stylistic differences and some structural variations, but no single-word translation errors significantly alter the meaning. Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, no errors are present.
supply → Angebot → Versorgung  	spring → Frühjahr → Neubrunn  	elevated → gewachsene → Hochbehälter  	hosepipe → Hoffnung → Schläuchen  		**Explanation:** The mistranslation errors identified significantly alter the meaning of the candidate translation: "Angebot" (offer) instead of "Versorgung" (supply), "Frühjahr" (spring as in season) instead of "Neubrunn" (new spring referring to a specific place), "gewachsene" (grown) instead of "Hochbehälter" (elevated tank), and "Hoffnung" (hope) instead of "Schläuchen" (hose). These errors violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, as they change the context and intended meaning of the original sentence.
management → Verwaltung → Geschäftsführung  	passed → übertragen → übergeben  		**Explanation:** "Verwaltung" (administration) is a mistranslation of "management", which is more accurately represented by "Geschäftsführung". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because "Verwaltung" implies a different scope of responsibility. "Übertragen" (transferred) and "übergaben" (handed over) differ in nuance, with "übergeben" being the more appropriate translation in this context, maintaining the intended meaning of a formal transfer of management.
open → offen für → offen mit  		**Explanation:** The phrase "offen für" translates to "open for," but in this context, "open with" (as in "openly discusses") is the intended meaning. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the candidate translation changes the relationship between the subject and the topic, making it seem like she is open to the condition itself rather than being candid about it.
Medicine → Arzneimittel → Medizin  	has come a long way → sind weit gekommen → hat große Fortschritte gemacht  	the (gender) → der 44-jährige → die 44-Jährige  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Arzneimittel" (medicines/drugs) is a mistranslation of "Medicine" in this context. "Medicine" refers to the field, not the physical substances, and should be translated as "Medizin."	2. "sind weit gekommen" (have come far) does not capture the progress implied by "has come a long way", which is better expressed as "hat große Fortschritte gemacht" (has made great progress).	3. "der 44-jährige" (the 44-year-old man) should match the gender in "die 44-Jährige" (the 44-year-old woman), as indicated in the reference translation.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence "Als ihr Sohn von der Krankheit diagnostiziert wurde, dachte sie, sie würde sterben." conveys the same meaning as the source sentence when compared to the reference. The differences, such as "diagnostiziert wurde" instead of "erkannt worden sei", do not significantly alter the meaning, especially since "diagnostiziert" and "erkannt" are both contextually valid translations of being medically recognized or identified. Similarly, "dachte" and "glaubte" convey equivalent meaning in this sentence. Thus, no single-word translation errors are found according to the task instructions.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the essential information, using reasonable German expressions parallel to the source's meaning. Words like "geschult wurde" for "being schooled" and "privat" for "privately" serve their contextual purposes, aligning with "lerne nun privat" from the reference. While there are variations in syntax and phrasing, the candidate translation doesn't have clear single-word translation errors that alter the sentence's meaning based on the provided criteria.
sang → sagte → sang		**Explanation:** The word "sagte" (said) is a mistranslation of "sang" (sang) in this context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because saying something at a location and singing at La Scala require different actions, changing the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "auf der Erde" and "auf Erden" are valid translations for "on earth". The candidate translation preserves the intended meaning and follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, thus no significant translation errors are detected.
(offspring → Nachwuchs → stammt aus)  	(bass-baritone → Bas-Barbarone → Bassbariton)  		**Explanation:** "Nachwuchs" (young talent) is a less precise translation of "offspring" that can imply something like new generation or talent but not biological lineage, as in the reference. The term "Bas-Barbarone" appears to be an erroneous variation of "Bassbariton" (bass-baritone), which specifically refers to a vocal register, and needs to be accurate in this musical context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the intended meaning accurately. The difference between "now" and "jetzt" versus "nun" is negligible in this context, and both convey the same time aspect. The name spelling variation does not affect the translation task as names are commonly transliterated differently. Therefore, it follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule as the meaning remains intact.
- Crime passionelle → Kriminalität → Beziehungstat	- partner → Partner → Lebensgefährtin		**Explanation:** "Kriminalität" (crime) is a mistranslation of "Crime passionelle," which refers to a crime of passion, more accurately translated as "Beziehungstat" (relationship crime). "Partner" (partner) is a mistranslation of "his partner" in this context, which should specifically refer to "Lebensgefährtin" (female partner) as per the source and reference sentences. Both errors violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as they significantly alter the meaning and context of the sentence.
partner → Partner → Partnerin	Apartments building → Apartementsgebäude → Mehrfamilienhaus		**Explanation:** "Partner" is a mistranslation of "partner" when compared to "Partnerin" because the context suggests a female partner ("sie" refers to a female in the sentence). "Apartementsgebäude" is a less accurate translation for "apartment building" compared to "Mehrfamilienhaus," which more accurately conveys the meaning of a residential building containing multiple apartments.
partner → Partner → Lebensgefährtin		**Explanation:** "Partner" is used in the candidate translation, while the reference translation specifies "Lebensgefährtin", indicating a female partner. This distinction is significant for the intended contextual meaning, fitting the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source sentence. The variations between the candidate and the reference, such as "wird offiziell gesucht" and "öffentlich gefahndet", do not significantly change the intended meaning of "officially being sought". Both are valid translations in context, consistent with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
search → Suche → Mitteilung  	happening → findet statt → passiert  	across → in ganz → bundesweit  	might → kann → könnte  		**Explanation:** 		- "Suche" (search) does not accurately capture the reference "Mitteilung" (announcement or message). This represents a significant shift in meaning, violating **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.	- "findet statt" (takes place) is not correctly mapped to "passiert" (is happening), affecting the contextual translation accuracy.	- "in ganz" (throughout/entire) fails to convey "bundesweit" (nationwide), altering the scope and significance of the search.	- "kann" (can) is not a suitable translation for "könnte" (might), altering the likelihood and uncertainty of the statement.
1. muscular → muskularisch → muskulös  	2. sun-tanned → sonnenbesetzt → braungebrannt  	3. bald patch → böses Flickwerk → Glatze  		**Explanation:**  	- "muskularisch" is an incorrect translation for "muscular." The correct word in German is "muskulös."	- "sonnenbesetzt" is not a valid translation for "sun-tanned." The appropriate word is "braungebrannt."	- "böses Flickwerk" translates to something akin to "evil patchwork," which is a significant mistranslation for "bald patch." The correct translation is "Glatze."
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Die Polizei hat jetzt ein Foto von ihm veröffentlicht" correctly conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The word "jetzt" used in the candidate translation is an acceptable variation for conveying the timing ("now"), similar to "mittlerweile" in the reference translation. Since the meaning remains intact and no single-word errors that significantly alter meaning are present, no translation error is reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Aber es ist ein paar Jahre alt" uses "Aber" (but) as a translation of "but", and "ein paar Jahre alt" faithfully reflects "a couple of years old". The differences between "Aber" (but) and "allerdings" (however) are minor and acceptable in translation, and they do not significantly change the meaning of the sentence, per the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, no mistranslation is reported.
bald → schiefes → Glatze		**Explanation:** "schiefes Flickwerk" (skewed patchwork) is a mistranslation of "bald patch". The word "schiefes" (skewed) changes the intended meaning significantly, specifically for "bald," which refers to hair loss, not to something being crooked or skewed. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. From the translation, "Glatze" (bald) is needed to maintain the meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both the candidate and the reference translations convey the idea that "the man should not be approached or spoken to," which aligns with the source sentence. The usage of "angesprochen werden" in the candidate sentence and "direkt angesprochen werden" in the reference may be slightly different in tone but do not change the intended meaning, thus adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
believe → glaubt → so  	may → kann → könne  		**Explanation:** "glaubt" is a mistranslation of "believe" in this context, as it does not reflect the indirect speech correctly, whereas "so" is used correctly in the reference. "kann" is a mistranslation of "may," which suggests ability rather than the possibility or allowance expressed by "könne" in indirect speech, thus significantly altering the meaning.
110 → nennen → rufen  		**Explanation:** "nennen" (name) is a mistranslation of "call" in the context of calling an emergency number. The correct translation should involve "rufen" (call) as used in the reference, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule to reflect the intended meaning of making a phone call.
crime passionelle → Verbrechensliga → Beziehungstat  		**Explanation:** "Verbrechensliga" (crime league) is a mistranslation of "crime passionelle", which refers to a crime of passion. This significantly alters the meaning of the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. The intended expression is captured by the term "Beziehungstat".
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the same meaning as the reference, despite using slightly different structures. The key information about the birth years of the victim and perpetrator is accurately translated, and the use of "geboren" (born) and "sei Jahrgang" (born in the year) are acceptable variations, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon analyzing the candidate translation against the reference, there are no significant single-word translation errors that alter the intended meaning of the source sentence. While there are differences between the candidate and reference translations, they do not constitute errors under the guidelines, as key information like "Polizeitruppe" for "police force" and "getötet wurde" for "killed" accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Mord" and "Tötungsdelikt" can be used to translate "homicide," though "Mord" is more specific and commonly understood as "murder," it fits the general context here without altering the essential meaning of the sentence. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where the candidate does not incorrectly convey the source's meaning, thus no errors are reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference. The phrase "Wir sagen jetzt nicht mehr" is a valid translation for "We are not saying any more at this time". The differences in word order and slight variations in wording do not significantly change the meaning of the sentence, complying with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
SWAT team → SWAT-Team → Spezialeinsatzkommando (SEK)  	scene → Ort → Tatort  		**Explanation:**  	1. "SWAT team" was translated as "SWAT-Team" in the candidate sentence, but the reference uses "Spezialeinsatzkommando (SEK)", which is the localized term for a German-speaking context, according to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "scene" was translated as "Ort", which is a more general term for "place" or "location" instead of "scene", which in this context is specifically "Tatort" meaning "crime scene", as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
ray → Hoffnungsstrahl → Lichtblick  		**Explanation:** "Hoffnungsstrahl" (ray of hope) and "Lichtblick" (glimmer of hope) are both expressions related to hope, but "Lichtblick" is the more contextually appropriate term commonly used in this reference and carries the intended connotation better. Since this difference affects the nuance conveyed by the term "hope," it follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
crises → gedrängt → krisengebeutelte  	spared → erspart → verschont
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The candidate translation does not contain single-word errors that change the core meaning of the sentence in a significant way. All critical concepts such as "financial burdens," "promotion of green energy," and "off the table" are correctly translated, preserving the intended message, thus complying with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, and the words chosen align well with both the source and the reference translations. No single-word elements significantly alter the intended meaning, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules. Comparing "Federal Minister of the Economy" with "Wirtschaftsminister" and "exemption from the renewable energies levy" with "Ausnahme von der Umlage für erneuerbare Energien," both are contextually consistent with the reference translation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While there are differences between the candidate and reference translations, they don't constitute significant errors that change the meaning of the sentence. Both translations adequately convey the original meaning without introducing any incorrect words, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
planned → geplant → zunächst geplant  	blast furnaces → Blasfasern → Hochofen  		**Explanation:** 		1. "ursprünglich geplant" (originally planned) translates directly, but in the reference, "zunächst geplant" (initially planned) is used, which is closer in meaning contextually and suggests a mistranslation due to the slight shift in temporal nuance. However, given that both temporal contexts (originally vs. initially) lead to the same outcome in this context, this is not marked as an error. Still, the intention was to express the step-by-step planning process as in the reference.	   	2. "blast furnaces" is mistranslated as "Blasfasern" (blowing fibers), which does not fit the context of a steel manufacturing process. The correct term "Hochofen" (blast furnace) is used in the reference and aligns with the intended meaning in the source, addressing the **Identify Mistranslations** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
association → Verband → Branchenverbands  	threatened → in Gefahr → drohten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Verband" (association) is used in the candidate, but the more contextually appropriate translation would be "Branchenverbands" (industry association), which captures the specific type of association mentioned in the source.	2. "in Gefahr" (in danger) is not an accurate translation for "threatened" in this context. The reference uses "drohten," which correctly conveys that the steel industry is at risk of incurring additional costs, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. Although there are variations in phrasing, such as "grundlegende Vereinbarung" versus "Grundsatzeinigung", both are acceptable translations for "basic agreement" in this context. The focus remains intact, which avoids violating any of the given rules.
EEG → EEV → EEG  		**Explanation:** "EEV" is a mistranslation of "EEG". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "EEG" refers to a specific term (likely related to a levy or surcharge) which is inaccurately translated here, affecting the meaning of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Auch das wird nicht gegen die Stahlindustrie erhoben" captures the meaning of the source sentence well, translating "will not be levied against the steel industry" correctly. Although there are slight differences, such as "against" being translated as "gegen" instead of "in der", these do not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence regarding the context and intent. Therefore, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no errors are reported.
Germany → die → Deutschlands  	self-generation → Stromerzeugung → Eigenstromerzeugung  		**Explanation:** 	1. "die" (the) is a mistranslation of "Germany." It omits the implied subject, which is Germany in this context. The correct translation explicitly mentions "Deutschlands."	2. "Stromerzeugung" (electricity generation) is a mistranslation of "self-generation" ("Eigenstromerzeugung"), which specifically refers to the generation of electricity by the entity using it, not just general electricity generation. This significantly alters the meaning following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with the reference translation, maintaining the intended meaning of the source sentence. Although there are differences in wording, they do not result in a significant change of meaning, and the overall context is preserved. Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no errors are reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both the candidate translation and the reference translation convey the importance of Gabriel's efforts to the steel industry, despite wording differences. The meanings align sufficiently to follow the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the overall meaning and intent of the source sentence. The key elements are present and accurately reflect the source content. The structure and presentation of the phrase "Stahl ist die Zukunft" correspond well enough with "steel is the future," and the context is faithfully represented. Thus, no significant single-word translation errors are present according to the provided guidelines.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Dem müssen weitere Schritte folgen" accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence "This needs to be followed by other steps." Although the structure differs from the reference translation "Weitere müssen folgen," the essential elements and intent are preserved, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. There is no significant change in meaning or context that would necessitate flagging any word as a mistranslation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and differs from the reference sentence only in structure but not in meaning. The key terms such as "Klimaziele" (climate targets), "Beschäftigungsziele" (employment objectives), and "Emissionszertifikate" (emissions allowances) are accurately translated. While there are differences in phrasing, none of these alter the intended meaning, and thus, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, there are no significant translation errors to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and aligns closely with the reference translation. The choice of words such as "Stahlsektor" (steel sector), "Finanzkrise" (financial crisis), and "Überkapazitäten" (overcapacities) are appropriate and maintain the intended message of the source sentence. There are no significant changes in meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence accurately and maintains coherence with the reference translation. While there are differences in phrasing, such as "verschlimmert" vs. "verschärfte" and "gebracht hat" vs. "warf", these do not constitute significant mistranslations or errors within the context provided, as they do not alter the overall meaning of the sentence. Thus, in adherence to the instructions of **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully**, no errors are reported.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the same meaning as the source and matches the reference translation in terms of content and accuracy. There are no single-word translation errors as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** instruction, and no mistranslations that alter the overall meaning or intent of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The difference between "improved slightly" (leicht verbessert) and "relaxed somewhat" (etwas entspannt) does not significantly alter the core meaning. Both translations capture the sense of a positive change in the situation. Therefore, per the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no significant translation errors are identified.
import taxes → Einfuhrsteuern → Einfuhrzölle  		**Explanation:** "Einfuhrsteuern" (import taxes) is a mistranslation of "import taxes", where "Einfuhrzölle" (import duties) is preferred in the reference. Although both may refer to taxes related to imports, "Einfuhrzölle" is more accurate in this context.
how long → wie lange → nachhaltig  		**Explanation:** The candidate's translation of "wie lange" (how long) does not capture the meaning of "nachhaltig" (sustainably) from the reference, which affects the sentence's meaning in terms of price duration certainty. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules. Additionally, no direct equivalent for "will remain perked up for" in the candidate matches the reference's idea of "Preiserholung" (price recovery). However, the primary word mismatch here is "wie lange" versus "nachhaltig," leading to this mistranslation being the focal point.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. "Wirtschaftsführer" as "sector leader" is a reasonable interpretation, and both "war" and "blieb" serve to show that Thyssenkrupp was cautious. Therefore, there are no mistranslations violating the rules.
prices → geplündert → stagniert		**Explanation:** "geplündert" (plundered) is a mistranslation of "plateaued", which changes the meaning of the sentence. This significantly alters the intended meaning and violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by suggesting a decrease or theft instead of stability.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation aligns with the source and reference sentences. The word choices like "Sektor" for "sector", "schwierige Situation" for "tricky situation", and "die Preise weiter senkt" for "reducing prices further" maintain the intended meaning. Additionally, there are no significant changes in meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, and thus no errors are reported.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference. Both "Anlagen" and "Werke" can refer to "plants" or "facilities," and both translations accurately convey the intended content and meaning. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as the translation choice does not alter the sentence's meaning significantly.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The order of phrases is slightly different, but it doesn't affect the overall meaning. All key terms such as "end of 2015," "around 86,000 people," "employed," and "Germany's steel industry" are correctly translated, aligning well with the reference translation. Thus, there are no significant single-word translation errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the meaning of the source sentence accurately. The use of "steigender Aufträge" for "increasing orders" and "zurückhaltend" for "cautious" fits the context, and while "zunehmenden Bestellungen" in the reference could suggest different phrasing, it does not affect the intended meaning significantly. Therefore, according to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** guidelines, no significant single-word translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. "im Vorjahr" (in the previous year) is a slight variation from "im Vorjahresmonat" (in the corresponding month in the previous year), but it does not significantly alter the meaning in this context. Both "erzeugten" and "produzierten" correctly represent "produced," and "der Stahlverband" is a general term encompassing the specific "Wirtschaftsvereinigung Stahl". Thus, there are no significant errors to report following the instructions.
brief spike → kurzen Rede → kurzen Erhöhung	amounts → Beträge → Menge
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and the reference translation both convey the intended meaning of the source sentence accurately. The phrasing "Seit Beginn des Jahres" and "Seit Jahresbeginn" are synonymous, and the differences in wording do not alter the overall meaning. Therefore, there are no significant translation errors.
expecting → erwartet → rechnet  	output → Produktion → Ausstoß  		**Explanation:** "erwartet" (expects) is a mistranslation of "expecting" in this context where "rechnet" (anticipates) is a more accurate reflection of the original meaning, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Produktion" (production) is a mistranslation of "output," where "Ausstoß" (output, especially in terms of production or emissions) is the correct reference, significantly impacting meaning, thus reflecting the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
mind → Gesundheit → Geist  	singing → Senken → Singen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Gesundheit" (health) is a mistranslation of "mind". In the context of this sentence, "mind" should relate to "Geist". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since "Gesundheit" already appears as the translation for "health".	2. "Senken" (lowering/reducing) is a mistranslation of "singing". This significantly changes the intended meaning of the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it diverges from the original context of an activity benefiting the elderly.
Singing → Singapur → Das Singen	sings → Sänge → singt		**Explanation:**  	- "Singing" should be translated as "Das Singen," but it was translated as "Singapur," which is the name of a place and does not fit contextually. This is a significant change in meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "sings" should be translated as "singt," but it was translated as "Sänge," which is incorrect since "Sänge" refers to "songs" or "singing" in a different form, not fitting the intended verb form "sings." This changes the grammatical structure unnecessarily and affects the meaning, thus violating the **Identify Mistranslations** rule.
singing → Singing → Singen	physically → physisch → körperlich		**Explanation:** "Singing" should be translated as "Singen" to correctly reflect the noun form in German. "Physisch" is a mistranslation of "physically" in this context, as "körperlich" is the appropriate term to describe physical movement or feelings in relation to the body, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
rehearsal → Generalprobe → Probe	balanced → ausgewogen → ausgeglichen	happy → glücklich → fröhlich	generally → allgemein → insgesamt		**Explanation:** 	1. "Generalprobe" (final rehearsal) is a mistranslation of "rehearsal," which can be any rehearsal, not necessarily a final one. This aligns with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	2. "Ausgewogen" (well-balanced) is a mistranslation of "balanced" in the sense of "emotionally balanced," which is better captured by "ausgeglichen." This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	3. "Glücklich" (happy) is a somewhat acceptable translation, but "fröhlich" (cheerful) aligns better with the context provided by the reference.	4. "Allgemein" (generally) is a plausible translation but doesn’t capture the sense of "in total" or "overall" implied by "insgesamt" (overall), which fits the contextual meaning better.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the meaning of the source sentence accurately. The use of "Darüber hinaus" (and additionally/besides) matches the intended context, and the rest of the translation maintains the original sentence's meaning, respecting the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
Singing → Singing → Singen  	elderly → älteren Menschen → Senioren  	host → vielerlei → mehreren  	great → großes → tolles  	Association → Verband → Seniorenliga  		**Explanation:**  	- "Singing" was left untranslated in the candidate translation, which violates the **Contextual Accuracy** requirement.	- "älteren Menschen" translates to "older people," while "Senioren" is a more accurate translation of "elderly" in the provided context, considering it is about an organization for senior citizens.	- "vielerlei" means "many kinds of," which slightly deviates from the more precise "mehreren" (several), considering the context of a "host of reasons."	- "großes" means "big," while "tolles" better translates to "great" in this context, maintaining the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Verband" is a general term for "association," but "Seniorenliga" accurately reflects the specific organization, which is significant for correct interpretation.
1. elderly → älteren → Senioren  	**Explanation:** "Älteren" (older) is used instead of "Senioren" (elderly), which specifically refers to older people. This is a mistranslation because "elderly" in the context of the sentence refers to seniors, not just older people in general, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.		2. share → profitieren → teilen  	**Explanation:** "Profitieren" (benefit) is used instead of "Teilen" (share), which changes the meaning significantly. The original sentence talks about sharing enjoyment, not benefiting from music with like-minded people. This error significantly impacts the meaning, aligning with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.		3. says → sagen → beschreibt  	**Explanation:** "Sagen" (say) is plural and mismatched with "Hackler," which is singular. The intended meaning is more accurately captured by "Beschreibt" (describes), as it refers to Hackler's statement. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. 		4. Hackler → Hakkler → Hackler  	**Explanation:** "Hakkler" is a misspelling of "Hackler", introducing an error that changes the name. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as names should be accurately spelled.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the same meaning as the source sentence. Although there are some differences in wording compared to the reference translation, such as "ältere Menschen" for "the elderly" instead of "Senioren", these variations do not significantly alter the meaning or violate any of the error detection rules. Therefore, no single-word translation errors are present.
weaken → schwächen → auflösen  	choir → Chor → ein Chor  		**Explanation:**  	1. "schwächen" (weaken) is translated correctly in isolation but lacks the reflexive sense needed to convey the self-dissolving nature implied by "weaken" as intended in this context. The reference uses "auflösen" which means "dissolve," capturing the self-directed weakening implied.  	2. "Chor" (choir) is linguistically valid, but lacks the article "ein," making it grammatically incorrect in this sentence's context. In German, using "ein" provides correct generic references to non-specific members of a group, as intended by "a perfect way."
Ursel → Usel → Ursel  	way → zusammenzuleben → Zusammenseins		**Explanation:**  	- "Ursel" was mistranslated as "Usel", which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as names should remain consistent.	- The phrase "way of being together with other people" is translated as "zusammenzuleben," which means "living together," instead of the more accurate "Zusammenseins" or "being together," which matches the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it changes the context of the original sentence.
Singing → Singingings → Singen  	demanding → anspruchsvoll → anstrengend  		**Explanation:** "Singingings" is not a valid German word and incorrectly translates "Singing". This violates the **Identify Mistranslations** rule as it does not match the source or reference meaning. "anspruchsvoll" (demanding) does not convey the same intensity as "anstrengend" (strenuous), which is the correct translation in this context, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although the structures of the candidate and reference sentences differ, the meaning is preserved. Both "lehrt" (teaches) and "trainieren" (train) convey the action of learning or practicing, and "ältere Menschen" (elderly people) and "Senioren" (seniors) are equivalent in context. Hence, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, there are no significant single-word mistranslations to report.
limits → Grenzen → fordert  	run out of breath → aus dem Atem laufen → aus der Puste  		**Explanation:**  	1. **"limits → Grenzen → fordert"**: "Grenzen" (limits) is a literal translation, but "fordert" (challenge) in the reference captures the intended meaning better in context. This aligns with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it's about achieving physical fitness.	   	2. **"run out of breath → aus dem Atem laufen → aus der Puste"**: "aus dem Atem laufen" is a more direct translation but less idiomatic than "aus der Puste", which better conveys the idea of becoming winded in German. This change is crucial due to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it affects how the physical state is described idiomatically in daily life contexts.
Klang → Stimme → Klang		**Explanation:** "Stimme" (voice) should be translated as "Klang" (sound) in this context to align with the reference translation. The focus of the sentence is on the quality of the voice (sound) rather than the voice itself, which changes the intended meaning.
Singing → Singing → Singen  	German Association of Senior Citizens' Associations → deutschen Verband Seniorenverband → Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisationen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Singing" in the candidate sentence is not translated into German. The correct translation should be "Singen" as per the reference translation.	2. "deutschen Verband Seniorenverband" is a mistranslation of "German Association of Senior Citizens' Associations". The correct translation is "Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisationen", as indicated in the reference translation. The candidate translation does not accurately represent the organization mentioned, and therefore violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
singing → Zusammenleben → Singen  		**Explanation:** "Zusammenleben" (living together) is a mistranslation of "singing" and changes the meaning of the sentence. "Singen" (singing) is the correct reference word, which aligns with the source sentence's meaning. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, as the activity of singing is crucial to the context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence accurately reflects the source sentence's meaning, and the word choices like "sieht" for "sees," "Anhörung" for "listening," and "Emotionen" for "emotions" are contextually appropriate. Although there are variations in wording compared to the reference translation, the overall meaning and important elements are preserved, which adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
song → Starke → Lied  	texts → Texte → Liedtexte  		**Explanation:** "Starke" (strong) is a mistranslation of "song," as used in the context of "song texts." The source emphasizes song lyrics ("Liedtexte"), which is a more contextual term than "starke Texte" (strong texts). Similarly, "texts" should be translated as "Liedtexte" in this specific context, which highlights the focus on song lyrics rather than generic texts. These violate the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, where the meaning in the musical context is changed.
Singing → Singapur → Singen  	demands → erfordert → abverlangt  		**Explanation:** "Singapur" (Singapore) is a mistranslation of "Singing", which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as Singapore is unrelated to the context. "erfordert" (requires) does match "demands" closely; however, given the context in the reference, "abverlangt" (demands in a more demanding sense) might offer a slightly distinct nuance worth considering, yet it may be borderline and context-dependent. Nonetheless, the primary clear error remains with "Singapur".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, maintaining the essence of focusing on one's own voice and rhythm while adapting to other singers as a significant cognitive challenge. No significant single-word errors that change the intended meaning are present, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the overall meaning of the source sentence, allowing for slight variations in expression. The choice of "ihre Aufmerksamkeit auf andere Menschen als sich selbst richten" effectively conveys focusing on others, just as "sich nicht nur auf sich selbst zu konzentrieren" does. Thus, there are no significant translation errors based on the guidelines.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with the source and reference translations. There are no meaningful translation errors that significantly alter the meaning of the individual words in context. The slight variations in structure and phrasing do not violate the guidelines.
happy → glückliches → begeistertes		**Explanation:** "glückliches" (happy) is a mistranslation of "enthusiastic", which in German is better represented by "begeistertes". The meaning changes from an audience feeling content to one showing enthusiasm or excitement, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
self-esteem → Selbstachtung → Selbstwertgefühl  		**Explanation:** "Selbstachtung" (self-respect) is a mistranslation of "self-esteem". The term "Selbstwertgefühl" is more appropriate for the context of boosting one's self-esteem through singing in a choir, as it refers specifically to feelings of self-worth. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by not fitting the intended psychological aspect of self-esteem.
1. show → zeigen → zu zeigen		**Explanation:** "zeigen" (show) in the candidate is not preceded by "zu", which is necessary here to form the infinitive construction "Sich selbst zu zeigen," preserving the structure and meaning. This aligns with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		2. strength → Kraft → stärkt		**Explanation:** "Kraft" (strength) as a noun does not carry the same dynamic action as "stärkt" (strengthens), which fits the verb form in the reference sentence. This changes the implied nature of what the experience does, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source sentence. While the structure differs from the reference translation, the words used maintain the original sentence's intent and meaning. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule because alternative structures and synonymous expressions do not constitute errors if they preserve the intended meaning.
new → neuen → neues  	hobby → Hobby → Hobby  	delay → verzögern → zögern  		**Explanation:**  	1. "neuen" is a mistranslation of "new" as it should be "neues" in the context of "neues Hobby" (new hobby) to comply with grammatical gender agreement in German.	2. "Hobby" is correctly translated and matches the reference; hence, it is not a mistranslation despite appearing in the output above. (Added to clarify why it appears, it's a repeat/context clarification)	3. "verzögern" means "to delay," which does not capture the intended meaning of "zögern" (to hesitate) in this context. The phrase in English is advising not to hesitate, which aligns better with "zögern." Hence, it violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the recommendation's tone from acting promptly to not delaying.
you're → Sie → Man  	yourself → Ihnen → allein  	note's → Notiz → Ton  		**Explanation:**  	- "Sie" (you/they) is a mistranslation of "You're," which in this context should be more general and impersonal like "Man" (one), to fit the group activity context, adhering to **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.	- "Ihnen" (you) incorrectly translates "yourself," which should be "allein" (alone) to match the sense of singing alone, following **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.	- "Notiz" (note as in a written note) is a mistranslation of "note" (musical note). The correct word is "Ton," which fits the musical context, hence following **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.
elderly → Ältere → Senioren  	options → Fuß → Möglichkeiten  	Hackler → Hakkler → Hackler  		**Explanation:** "Ältere" (older) is a less precise translation of "elderly", which in context refers specifically to "Senioren" (seniors). "Fuß" (foot) is a mistranslation of "options", where "Möglichkeiten" (possibilities/options) is the correct term. "Hakkler" is a spelling error in the name "Hackler". This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**, **Focus on Single-Word Errors**, and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
know → bereits → aus dem Bekanntenkreis  	elderly → ältere Menschen → Senioren  	just → nur → einfach  		**Explanation:**  	- "bereits" (already) incorrectly replaced "know", which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it suggests a different condition entirely than the source.	- "ältere Menschen" (older people) is a mistranslation of "elderly", which should be more contextually precise as "Senioren" (seniors or elderly in a more general group sense).	- "nur" (only [just]) alters the sense of simply joining or going along without stipulations, which does not match "just" in the sense of "simply." This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes the ease and intent suggested in the original sentence.
choirs → Tore → Chöre		**Explanation:** "Tore" (goals/gates) is a mistranslation of "choirs". This is a significant error as it changes the subject from musical groups to something unrelated, which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by altering the intended meaning of the sentence.
parish → Parish → Gemeinde  	churchwarden → Kirchenchirr → Kirchenvorsteher  		**Explanation:** "Parish" is not translated (remains in English), where "Gemeinde" would have been correct to convey "parish". "Kirchenchirr" is a mistranslation or typo and does not exist in German, where "Kirchenvorsteher" would be the correct term for "churchwarden".
choirs → Ochsen → Seniorenchöre		**Explanation:** "Ochsen" (oxen) is a mistranslation of "choirs", which is a significant error as it completely changes the entity being referred to. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the correct concept involves musical groups, not animals.
ask → bitten → um Hilfe bitten  	look things up → die Dinge zu betrachten → bei der Internetrecherche  		**Explanation:** "bitten" (ask) lacks the specificity of "um Hilfe bitten" (ask for help) in the context of seeking assistance, which changes the instruction's intent. "die Dinge zu betrachten" (to look at things) doesn't correctly convey the action "look things up" (research or seek information online), which is expressed more accurately by "bei der Internetrecherche" (for online research). Both errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by not fitting the intended action in the context.
interested → interessiert → Lust  	absolutely → absolut → unbedingt  	thinks → denkt → rät  		**Explanation:**  	- "interessiert" (interested) in the candidate is a literal translation, but in context, "Lust" (desire) as in the reference makes more sense idiomatically.	- "absolut" (absolutely) is a direct translation but doesn't convey the emphasis as "unbedingt" (absolutely/necessarily) would in the context.	- "denkt" (thinks) is a mistranslation in this context since the source sentence implies "rät" (advises/recommends), not just a thought.
singing → Singapur → Singen  	release → Freilassung → Befreiendes  		**Explanation:** "Singapur" (Singapore) is a mistranslation of "singing". "Freilassung" (release in the sense of setting free or discharging a person) is a mistranslation of "release" (in the sense of freeing emotion), significantly altering the intended meaning.
react → Mühlen → Schreie  	kittens → Küchen → Jungtiere  		**Explanation:** "Mühlen" (mills) is a mistranslation of "react", which doesn't fit the context. "Küchen" (kitchens) is a mistranslation of "kittens", which changes the meaning of the sentence.
kittens → Küchenschreie → Katzenbabys  		**Explanation:** "Küchenschreie" (kitchen cries) is a mistranslation of "kittens" (Katzenbabys). This is a significant error that changes the meaning of the sentence, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
miaowing → Mieat → Miauen  	counterparts → Kollegen → Weibchen  		**Explanation:** "Mieat" is not a valid German word and is not a translation of "miaowing", which should be "Miauen", aligning with the **Identify Mistranslations** rule. "Kollegen" translates to "colleagues" rather than "counterparts" in this context and does not reflect the gender-specific comparison being made in "Weibchen", following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
1. tell → zeigen → erkennen  	2. agitated → verärgert → Erregungsgrad  	3. kittens → Kitzen → Katzenbabys  	4. miaowing → Mieur → Miauen  		**Explanation:** "zeigen" (show) is a mistranslation of "tell" (determine, in context), "verärgert" (angry) is a mistranslation of "agitated" (excited, in context), "Kitzen" (incorrect plural form of a rarely used diminutive for "kittens") is a mistranslation of "kittens" (Katzenbabys), and "Mieur" is a non-existent word meant to be "miaowing" (Miauen). These errors violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules as they change the meaning of the original sentence significantly.
kittens → Kätzer → Kätzchen		**Explanation:** "Kätzer" is an incorrect translation for "kittens". The correct translation would be "Kätzchen," which accurately represents the intended meaning in context following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Identify Mistranslations** rules.
Male → Männerkatzen → Kater		**Explanation:** "Männerkatzen" (male cats) is a mistranslation of "Kater" (tomcats), which is the appropriate term for male domestic cats. The error violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Männerkatzen" is not a commonly used term for this context in German.
agitated → alterten → erregten  	kittens → Küchenmächen → Jungtieren  		**Explanation:** "alterten" (aged) is a mistranslation of "agitated", which significantly changes the context from emotional state to age. "Küchenmächen" (a nonsensical word that resembles "kitchen maid") is a mistranslation of "kittens", which should be "Jungtieren" (young animals) to match the context of young felines. These are significant errors as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures all significant elements and terms from the source sentence. "Verfasserin" is a correct translation of "author," "veröffentlicht" for "published," and all other components like the journal name and timing ("am Freitag") are consistent with the reference. While there are minor stylistic differences, there are no meaningful single-word mistranslations that impact the sentence's core meaning.
duration → Dauer → Dauer  	pitch → Spielraum → Tonhöhe  	kitten's → Kittens → Kätzchen-Schreie  		**Explanation:** The translation of "pitch" is incorrect, as "Spielraum" (scope/space) does not convey the intended meaning of auditory "Tonhöhe". The possessive form "kitten's" is incorrectly translated to "Kittens", while the correct reference is "Kätzchen-Schreie," reflecting the crying or vocalization of kittens. The word "duration" is correctly translated as "Dauer", so it is not listed as an error.
adult male cats → erwachsene männliche Katzen → Kater  	examined → geprüft → beobachtet  		**Explanation:**  	1. In German, the specific term for "adult male cats" is "Kater", whereas "erwachsene männliche Katzen" translates directly but is less precise. This fits the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it provides clarity on the gender of the cats in the context of animal husbandry.  	2. The candidate translation "geprüft" implies "tested", whereas the reference translation "beobachtet" means "observed". The context of an animal husbandry program suggests monitoring behavior, which makes "beobachtet" more appropriate. This error conforms to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
kitten → Kätzers → Kleinen  	sound → Ton → Rufe  	brother → Geschwister → Geschwistern  		**Explanation:** 	- "Kätzers" (male cat or incorrect variation of "kitten") is a mistranslation for "kitten", which should be "Kleinen" (small ones, young cats) in this context.	- "Ton" (sound) is a mistranslation for "Rufe" (calls or cries), which is more specific in the context of the sounds a kitten makes.	- "Geschwister" (singular form used for sibling) is used instead of the plural "Geschwistern" (siblings) which fits better in this context.
agitated → agitierten → erregten  	played → gezeigt → konfrontiert  		**Explanation:** The word "agitierten" (agitated) does not precisely match "erregten" (excited), which is a more suitable translation in this context as it conveys the emotion expressed by the cat sounds. The word "gezeigt" (shown) does not accurately translate "played" in the context of sound, where "konfrontiert" (confronted) better captures the idea of being exposed to or presented with the sounds.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation adequately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The word choices in the candidate match the intended meanings, even though the structure differs slightly from the reference sentence. "Stichprobengröße" (sample size), "Forscher" (researchers), and "signifikant" (significant) are all correctly translated from the source sentence. The prioritization of meaning is maintained, fulfilling the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
female → Frauen → Weibchen  	offspring → Nachkommen → Nachwuchs  	differentiate → Jungfrauen → Schreie  		**Explanation:**  	1. **female → Frauen → Weibchen**: "Frauen" (women) is a mistranslation of "females" in the context, where "Weibchen" (females) specifically denotes female animals.	2. **offspring → Nachkommen → Nachwuchs**: "Nachkommen" is semantically similar to "offspring" but contextually, "Nachwuchs" is a better fit when referring to the offspring of animals.	3. **differentiate → Jungfrauen → Schreie**: "Jungfrauen" (virgins) is an incorrect translation of "differentiate" in this context; it significantly changes the intended meaning. The reference shows the intended sense pertains to responding to distinct sounds, here denoted by "Schreie" (cries).
sound → Ton → Rufe  	speaker → Redner → Lautsprecher  	agitated → akagierten → erregteren  		**Explanation:** "Ton" (tone/sound) is a general translation but does not convey the meaning of "calls" (Rufe) which is used in the context of animal sounds. "Redner" (orator/speaker) refers to a person, whereas "Lautsprecher" (loudspeaker) refers to the device intended in this context. "akagierten" appears to be a misspelling or incorrect word form instead of "highly agitated" which is better translated as "erregteren".
may → kann → möglicherweise		innate → inständig → angeboren		sexual → sexuelle → Geschlechts		**Explanation:** 	- "may" is more accurately translated as "möglicherweise" in the context of expressing probability, rather than "kann", which conveys the ability to do something.	- "innate" is mistranslated as "inständig", which means "insistent" in English. The intended meaning is "angeboren", which refers to something that is inherent or natural.	- "sexual" in the context of maturity or development is better translated as "Geschlechts", which aligns with the term "sexual maturity", as is clear from the reference translation.
male cats → männlichen Katzen → Männchen  	biologist → Biologe → Biologin  		**Explanation:** "männlichen Katzen" (male cats) is a mistranslation of "Männchen" (males), which is a more general term and does not specifically refer to cats. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Biologe" (male biologist) is a gender-specific term that differs from "Biologin" (female biologist) in the reference. Since the gender of the biologist was specified in the source and reference, this is a meaningful error, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
babies' → Aufschrei → Babygeräusche		**Explanation:** "Aufschrei" (outcry) is a mistranslation of "babies' cries" as intended in the source, which changes the nuance significantly. The reference captures this as "Babygeräusche" (baby noises), which is broader but contextually fits better than "Aufschrei". Therefore, this follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it alters the intended type of sound from the source text.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence and aligns closely with the reference translation. Words like "Frauen" (women), "sensibler" (more sensitively), "Säuglinge" (infants), and "Biologin Marina Scheumann" (biologist Marina Scheumann) are accurately translated and do not alter the original meaning of the source sentence. The minor variations in structure and word choice, such as "selbst" and "ganz gleich" or "berichtete" placement, do not significantly change the meaning or violate any instructions. Thus, according to the task criteria, no significant single-word translation errors are present.
Supercup → Supecup → Supercup		**Explanation:** The candidate translation erroneously spells "Supercup" as "Supecup". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the name of the event is misspelled, affecting the sentence's accuracy.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The phrases "eine Fußballlegende in der Türkei" and "in der Türkei eine Fußball-Legende" are both correct translations of the source sentence, with no significant change in meaning. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where differences in word order or hyphenation that do not affect meaning are not considered errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source sentence and is in line with the reference translation. The differences are stylistic rather than significant mistranslations, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Organisation" and "Gruppe" can be used to refer to a group within the context of a terrorist organisation, and they preserve the meaning of the original sentence effectively. This aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where there are no meaningful errors requiring reporting.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation meaningfully conveys the content of the source sentence. While there are different structural choices between the candidate and reference translations, there are no single-word errors that significantly alter the intended meaning.
Duell → Duel → Duell  	Arch-Rivalen → Arch-Rivalen → Erzrivalen  	Supecup → Supecup → Supercup  	Zeile → Zeile → Linie  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Duel" should be "Duell" according to the reference, so there is a minor typographical error. However, given its proximity to the reference, this is not significantly meaningful but is noted for completion.	2. "Arch-Rivalen" is not an acceptable translation for "arch-rivals" (correct: "Erzrivalen"). This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** as "Erzrivalen" has both historical and contextual weight that connotes deep-seated rivalry.	3. "Supecup" appears to be a typographical error and is corrected to "Supercup" per the reference, given its contextual relevance to the official sports context in question.	4. "Zeile" is a mistranslation of "line". In the reference, "Linie" is used to convey the figurative meaning of an official stance or position, differing significantly from "Zeile" (a line of text), breaching the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
state of emergency → Ausnahmezustand → Verhängung  		**Explanation:** "Ankündigung" (announcement) is used in the candidate translation but should be "Verhängung" (imposition) in this context as indicated by the reference. However, the key mistranslation is the concept of "announcing" versus "imposing," which centers on the word associated with it in German.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon comparing the source and reference sentences with the candidate translation, we find that the key terms like "suspected," "followers," "imam Fethulla Gülen," and "believed to be responsible for the attempted coup" are accurately represented in the candidate translation. Any variations in phrasing closely align with the reference and do not alter the intended meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same overall meaning as the source and reference translation, despite differences in wording. "hört nicht auf" and "wird nicht halt gemacht" both express the idea of something not stopping in the context used here. The word "Fußball" (football) is translated correctly, and the sentence structure adequately captures the intended meaning. This aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule since the meaning remains intact, and there are no significant single-word errors to report.
state prosecutor → Staatsanwalt → Staatsanwaltschaft  	issued → erlassen → stellte aus  	arrest → Verhaftung → Haftbefehl  	striker → Sterkers → Starkicker  		**Explanation:**  	1. **State prosecutor**: In the candidate translation, "Staatsanwalt" is used instead of "Staatsanwaltschaft." Though both words relate to legal prosecution, "Staatsanwaltschaft" correctly refers to the entire prosecutor's office, aligning with the reference sentence.	2. **Issued**: The issuance of a warrant in legal terms typically uses "stellt aus" rather than "erlassen," which changes the legal nuance.	3. **Arrest**: "Verhaftung" (arrest) is not appropriate here, as "Haftbefehl" (warrant) correctly captures the procedural document involved.	4. **Striker**: "Sterkers" is likely a typographical error of "Stürmer" (or "Striker"), whereas "Starkicker" in the reference captures the intent of a notable football/soccer player.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the meaning of the source sentence accurately. The key elements such as "Sükür", "now lives in America", "accused", "member", and "terrorist organisation" are translated correctly to German. Although there are stylistic differences between the candidate and the reference translations, they do not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence, thus following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
responsible → Verantwortung → verantwortlich		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation, "Verantwortung" (responsibility) is used, changing the meaning compared to "responsibly" from the reference, "verantwortlich". This alters the sense of who is being held accountable, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The significant elements, such as the duration of "ninety days", the concept of "state of emergency" continuing until "October", and the effect on "the lives of most Turks" having "practically no effect" are all maintained within acceptable translation variations. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, acknowledging that while words may vary, the overall meaning is preserved.
democracy → Demokratiekontrollen → Demokratie-Wachen		**Explanation:** "Demokratiekontrollen" (democracy checks) is a mistranslation of "democracy vigils". This error significantly changes the intended meaning. A vigil is an event where people stay awake, often to protest or express solidarity, whereas "Kontrollen" implies a form of inspection or regulation. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the overall meaning of the source sentence when compared to the reference sentence. While the wording differs, it still accurately conveys the division of the country and sport into supporters and non-supporters of Erdogan, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence closely matches the reference translation, with "Insbesondere" and "Besonders" both meaning "in particular" or "especially," which are acceptable variations in this context. No significant changes in meaning or mistranslations are present, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same essential meaning as the source sentence. Although there are differences in sentence structure and word order compared to the reference, there are no single-word translation errors that significantly change the meaning or context. Therefore, this follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, and no error is reported.
hearts → sie → ihr Herz  		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation, "sie" (they) is used instead of "ihr Herz" (their hearts), which changes the intended meaning. This is a significant mistranslation in context, as the sentence refers to fans' emotions and allegiances represented by the beating of their hearts. This error follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
cup → Staatssieger → Pokalsieger  		**Explanation:** "Staatssieger" (state winners) is a mistranslation of "cup winners". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "Pokalsieger" (cup winners) is the correct context within a football or sports setting.
native → Eingeborene → Kölner  	sporting → Sportwert → sportlichen  	goals → Ziele → Toren  	assists → Unterstützung → Vorlagen  	completions → Wettkämpfen → Wettbewerben  	scorer → Spitzengärtner → Topscorer  		**Explanation:** "Eingeborene" translates to "aboriginal" or "native" in the sense of indigenous people, which in this context should be "Kölner" referring to a native of Cologne. "Sportwert" translates directly as "sporting value" but lacks the nuance of "sportlichen Wert," which is more precise in the context of sports accolades. "Ziele" means "goals" in the sense of aims or objectives, whereas "Toren" refers to soccer goals. "Unterstützung" translates to "support," but here it should be "Vorlagen," meaning assists in a sporting context. "Wettkämpfen" (competitions) is less appropriate than "Wettbewerben," which more accurately matches the context of sports contests. "Spitzengärtner" is an unusual mistranslation of "scorer," which should be "Topscorer," maintaining the context of scoring in sports.
Fenerbahce → Fernebahn → Fenerbahce  	scored → erkannte → erzielte  	goal → Ziel → 1:0-Siegtreffer  		**Explanation:** "Fernebahn" is an incorrect translation of "Fenerbahce", missing the specific team name. "erkannte" (recognized) does not correctly translate the action "scored" in the context of sports. "Ziel" (goal) does not carry the same meaning as "1:0-Siegtreffer" (1-0 winning goal), failing to convey the sports-specific achievement.
1. "Fanatik" → "Fanati-Zeitung" → "Fanatik"		**Explanation:** "Fanati-Zeitung" adds "Zeitung" making it slightly awkward and altering the specific name of the publication "Fanatik". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it's essential to maintain the original name of a publication.		2. praised → gelobt → bejubelte		**Explanation:** "gelobt" (praised) is a weaker term compared to "bejubelte" (celebrated), which conveys more enthusiasm and excitement. This changes the intensity of the praise, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.		3. player → Spieler → Beste		**Explanation:** "Beste" focuses on being the best whereas "Spieler" is just player. The original might suggest "the best" without explicitly tying only to being a player, but since the context is football, keeping "beste Spieler" maintains this notion. The significant shift was "Beste" versus "Spieler", needing focus on impactful word.		4. pitch → Spielfeld → Platz		**Explanation:** "Spielfeld" directly translates to "playing field" or "playing area", while "Platz" is a common term specifically used in sports contexts to refer to a "pitch" or "field". This minor contextual inaccuracy violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the more common term in football contexts should have been used.
finished → endete → abgeschlossen  	cup → Tasse → Pokal  		**Explanation:** "endete" (ended) is a mistranslation of "finished", which does not capture the context of completing something in a notable way, as indicated by "in style". "Tasse" (cup, as in a drinking vessel) is a mistranslation of "cup" (as in a competition trophy), which changes the intended meaning.
record-holders → Platteninhaber → Rekordmeister		**Explanation:** "Platteninhaber" (record owner) is a mistranslation of "record-holders", which refers to an athletic or sports team term "Rekordmeister" in German. This error significantly changes the meaning of the sentence in the sports context, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
knockout → Hirngespinst → Vorrunden-K.o  	heats → Champions League → Vorrunden  	Lions → Lons → Löwen  		**Explanation:**  	"Hirngespinst" (delusion) is a mistranslation of "knockout", which in this sports context refers to being eliminated. This represents a significant change of meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.  	"Heats" refers to the initial rounds, and is mistranslated as "Champions League". This changes the meaning of where the knockout occurred, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.  	"Lons" is a typographical error for "Lions", leading to a lack of contextual sense, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the elements of the source sentence. The phrase "sie erreichten erst den sechsten Platz" conveys the intended meaning of "only reached sixth place," and "im 'Süper Lig'" correctly references the league. The candidate translation and reference translation differ in structure, but both expressions fit the context correctly, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.
cup → Staatsstreich → Pokal  		**Explanation:** "Staatsstreich" (coup) is a mistranslation of "cup", which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it suggests a political event rather than a sporting event.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Wir haben es getan - und das ist das Wichtigste", sagte Podolski." conveys the same meaning as the source sentence and aligns with the reference translation. The structure "wir haben es getan" and "das ist das Wichtigste" are valid and accurately reflect the intended meaning of "We did it - and that's the most important thing." There are no significant single-word errors that change the core meaning, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Sieger" for "winners" and "ein besseres Jahr des Spiels" for "a better year of play," which accurately conveys the meaning intended by the source sentence. "Besitktas" is a proper noun and appears misspelled in the candidate, but since this does not fall under the typical word mistranslation category and there is no significant change in meaning, it is not counted as a translation error here. Therefore, no individual words are mistranslated.
basis → Grundstein → Basis  	star goalkeeper → Sternengestalter der Sterne → Torschützenkönig  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Grundstein" is a mistranslation of "basis". While "Grundstein" usually means foundation stone, it's acceptable here in the specific phrase, so this error may not be the most critical, but it's a noted shift.	2. "Sternengestalter der Sterne" (literally "star creator of stars") is a significant mistranslation of "star goalkeeper". The reference clearly mentions "Torschützenkönig" (goal-scoring king), which better captures the intended role and achievement as a top goal-scorer rather than a goalkeeper, a substantial error worth noting under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
31-year-old → 31-jährigen → 31-Jährigen  	returns → Renditen → Rückkehr  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation's "31-jährigen" does not reproduce the declined form "31-Jährigen" used in the reference when describing a person's return. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Renditen" (returns as in financial returns) is a mistranslation of "returns", which in context means "Rückkehr" (comeback or return of a person). This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it changes the meaning from a person's comeback to financial gains.
1. loan → Darlehen → ausgeliehene	2. coup → Staatsstreichversuch → Putschversuch	3. Championship → Europameisterschaft → EM		**Explanation:**  	- "Darlehen" (loan) is a mistranslation of "loan" in this context, where the correct term should reflect that the player is "ausgeliehen" (on loan) rather than a financial loan "Darlehen".	- "Staatsstreichversuch" (attempted coup) is a correct rendition; however, "Putschversuch" is a more contextually appropriate translation in reference to political coups in German.	- "Europameisterschaft" (European Championship) is a broader term, whereas "EM" is a more commonly used abbreviation in the context of soccer tournaments, aligning better with the reference and maintaining the sentence's coherency.
Kicker → zitierten → zitierte	magazine → Clubführers → Fachmagazin  		**Explanation:**  	1. **Kicker → zitierten → zitierte**: The candidate uses "zitierten" (plural or formal address for quoted), which doesn't correctly fit the sentence where "zitierte" (singular, quoted) is needed to match the singular noun "Fachzeitschrift" (specialist magazine).	2. **magazine → Clubführers → Fachmagazin**: The candidate uses "Clubführers" (club leader/director), which is a mistranslation of "magazine". The reference uses "Fachmagazin" for "specialist magazine". In this context, identifying the key word maintains clarity about the source of the quote.
star → Sterner → Stürmer		**Explanation:** "Sterner" (aster) is a mistranslation of "star", which in the context of sports typically means "Stürmer" (forward or top player). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "Sterner" is incorrect in the given sports context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with the reference and the meaning of the source sentence. "Athletes" is translated as "Sportler", which is an acceptable synonym for "Athleten". The phrase "still in with a chance of winning medals" translates to "haben noch immer die Chance, Medaillen zu gewinnen", which maintains the intended meaning. Thus, there are no significant mistranslations or deviations from the source allowing for the variations found.
Justin → Richter → Justin  	banned → verboten → gesperrt  		**Explanation:** "Richter" (judge) is a mistranslation of "Justin", which changes the subject of the sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the person being discussed is Justin Gatlin, not a judge. "verboten" (forbidden) is a mistranslation of "banned", which should be "gesperrt" in this context.
banned → verboten → darf nicht  		**Explanation:** "verboten" (forbidden) is a mistranslation of "banned," which, in this context, is better translated by the phrase "darf nicht" (not allowed), which captures the prohibition aspect more accurately. This respects the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it directly affects her capability to participate.
guilty → Schuldige → überführte  	competing → konkurrieren → kämpfen  		**Explanation:** "Schuldige" (guilty) is a mistranslation of "track athletes who have been found guilty" ("überführte Leichtathletik-Sünder"), missing the specificity of athletes in the context of doping violations. "konkurrieren" (compete) is a less contextually appropriate word compared to "kämpfen" (fight/struggle), which captures the essence of intense competition related to athletics. Both errors significantly alter the intended meaning of the sentence, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
issue → Dopingproblem → Thema		**Explanation:** "Dopingproblem" (doping problem) is a mistranslation of "issue". The correct translation "Thema" (theme or issue) is more aligned with the broader meaning of addressing doping as a topic or matter of concern, rather than specifying it as a problem. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule since it changes the nature of how doping is discussed in the context.
protested → protestierte → eingeklagt  	Brutalitätswut → Brutalitätswut → Brust  		**Explanation:**  	1. "protestierte" (protested) is a mistranslation of "appealed" ("eingeklagt" is more accurate in the legal context of appealing a conviction).	2. "Brutalitätswut" (brutality rage) erroneously translates "breaststroke" ("Brust" is the correct term for the swimming style). These errors significantly alter the meaning of the original sentence and follow the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by selecting the most impactful word within incorrect phrases.
bizarre → bizarre → skurrile  	waltzed → ging → stolziert  	entrance → Eingang → Auftritt  		**Explanation:**  	- "bizarre" (bizarre) directly translates but "skurrile" (quirky) fits better in the reference, yet "bizarre" remains marginally acceptable and hence not marked as an error initially. However, given the context of stylistic difference, we can justify it here, considering **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** for significant nuances.	- "waltzed" is mistranslated as "ging" (went), whereas "stolziert" (strutted) better conveys the original intent of a stylized or unusual way of moving in context, violating **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**. 	- "entrance" was translated to "Eingang" (entry), while in context, "Auftritt" (performance/entrance in sense of an act) captures the intended meaning more accurately, satisfying **Focus on Single-Word Errors** since it changes the context of the final word.
audience → Zuhörerin → Publikum		**Explanation:** "Zuhörerin" (female listener) is a mistranslation of "audience". The intended meaning is the crowd or group of people witnessing the event, not a single female listener. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes who is cheering.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While certain word choices like "anderen Athleten" for "other athletes" and "beteiligt waren" for "having been involved" differ from the reference, they are appropriate translations and do not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence. This adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules. Consequently, no single-word translation errors are found.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Überblick" and "Übersicht" can be used interchangeably in this context to convey the meaning of "overview". This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule since the meaning remains intact and thus no significant mistranslation occurs.
Justin → Gertin → Justin  	4x100m → 4x100 Millionen → 4x100-m  	track athletes → Spursportler → Figuren in der Leichtathletik  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Justin" was mistranslated as "Gertin", which is significant because it's a proper noun and changing it alters the identity of the person.  	2. "4x100m" was translated as "4x100 Millionen", which incorrectly introduces the word "Millionen" (millions), altering the meaning of the relay type.  	3. "track athletes" was mistranslated as "Spursportler", which specifically refers to someone who participates in track sports, whereas "Figuren in der Leichtathletik" more broadly encompasses "figures in athletics" and fits the context better.
banned → verboten → gesperrt  	for → für → wegen  		**Explanation:** "verboten" (forbidden) is a mistranslation of "banned," which should be "gesperrt" to indicate being barred or suspended in the sports context. "für" (for) is incorrectly used in this context; the correct term is "wegen" (because of/for), indicating the reason for the ban. These errors affect the meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
Olympic → Olympische → Olympiasieger  	World → Fußballweltmeisterschaft → Weltmeister  	banned → Verbot → Bann  	100m → 100 Millionen → 100 m  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Olympische" (Olympic) is used as an adjective, but it should be "Olympiasieger" (Olympic champion) to properly reflect the meaning in the context.  	2. "Fußballweltmeisterschaft" (football World Cup) is incorrectly used for "World Champion." The original refers to "Weltmeister" (World Champion), not specifically related to football.  	3. "Verbot" (ban) is mistranslated because it generally implies a prohibition rather than a period of suspension or banishment as "Bann" does in this context.  	4. "100 Millionen" (100 million) is clearly a mistranslation for "100m" (100 meters).
two-time → zweiseitige → zweimalige  	champion → Champions → Olympiasiegerin  	relay → Relais → Staffel  	four-time → vierfache → siebenfache  	ban → Verbot → Sperre  	Oxycodone → Oxycododo → Oxycodon  		**Explanation:**  	- "zweiseitige" (two-sided) is a mistranslation of "two-time", which should be "zweimalige" to indicate twice.	- "Champions" is a plural form used incorrectly for "champion", which should be "Olympiasiegerin" in this context.	- "Relais" is a mistranslation of "relay", which should be "Staffel" referring to the track event.	- The incorrect reduction of "four-time" affects understanding of ranks and titles: "vierfache" was incorrectly used instead of "siebenfache".	- "Verbot" (ban) in this context should be "Sperre" as it more accurately reflects a professional suspension in sports.	- "Oxycododo" is a typographical error for "Oxycodone", which should be "Oxycodon" in German.
29-year-old → 29-Jährigen → 29-Jährige		herself → sich → sich selbst		bad → schlechten → starke		saying → sagten → habe		**Explanation:**		- "29-Jährigen" (plural) is a mistranslation of "29-year-old" (singular), which should be "29-Jährige."	- "sich" (herself) could be expanded to "sich selbst" for clarity, but this is considered a minor difference, hence not included in the triple.	- "schlechten" (bad) changes the severity of the pain compared to "starke" (strong).	- "sagten" (they said) is incorrect for the singular context of "she said," which is "habe" in reported speech following "sich" in the reference.
1. discus → Diskussion → Diskus  	   **Explanation:** "Diskussion" (discussion) is a mistranslation of "discus". The context is important, as it refers to an athlete's sport discipline.	   	2. stimulant → stimulierenden → Stimulans-Mittel  	   **Explanation:** "stimulierenden" is a mistranslation of "stimulant". The adjective form does not fit well in the intended context, where a noun is required.		3. methyhexaminine → Methythinau → Methylhexanamin  	   **Explanation:** "Methythinau" is an incorrect rendering of "Methyhexaminine". The correct term is "Methylhexanamin", a specific chemical compound that is relevant here.		4. Champion → Champion → Olympiasiegerin  	   **Explanation:** "Champion" is not a correct translation for "Olympic Champion" when referring to a female athlete in the German language. The correct term is "Olympiasiegerin".
knowingly → wissentlich → wissentliche  	banned → verboten → gesperrt  		**Explanation:**  	1. "wissentlich" (knowingly) does not align with "the wissentliche Einnahme" (the knowing intake), which suggests denying its intake. The context implies a denial, and "weiterhin" should show that aspect. Hence, "wissentlich" is not appropriate.	2. "verboten" (forbidden) is not the same as "gesperrt" (banned, barred), which is more aligned with the context of being banned from participation.
1. throws → Stürme → Würfe	2. tipped → gehalten → Goldfavoritin		**Explanation:** "Stürme" (storms) is a mistranslation of "throws", which significantly alters the meaning from athletic performance to weather events, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "gehalten" (held) is a mistranslation of "tipped", where "Goldfavoritin" refers to a favorite or contender for gold, maintaining the intended context of likelihood or expectation, per **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
LaShawn → Shawn → LaShawn  	400 → 444000 Mio. → 400  	relay → Stellvertreter → Staffel  	Merrit → Mert → Merritt  	Champion → Champion → Olympiasieger  	two-time → Zwei-Zeit → zweimalige  	400m → 400 Millionen → 400 m  	World → Weltmeisterschaft → Weltmeister  	banned → verboten → gesperrt  		**Explanation:**  	- "LaShawn" is mistransliterated as "Shawn", affecting the proper noun.	- "400" is translated to "444000 Mio.", a clear numerical and unit mismatch.	- "relay" is mistranslated as "Stellvertreter" (deputy), not related to athletics.	- "Merrit" is misspelled as "Mert", affecting the proper noun.	- "Champion" is incomplete without "Olympic" in this context.	- "two-time" should be specified as "zweimalige" (twice) rather than "Zwei-Zeit" (two-time, literal).	- "400m" is mistranslated to "400 Millionen" (400 million), which changes meaning significantly.	- "World" translating to "Weltmeisterschaft" (World Championship) instead of "Weltmeister" (world champion) alters the meaning.	- "banned" translates to "verboten" (forbidden) instead of "gesperrt" (banned), fitting the context of sports sanctions better.
penis enlargement → Penise-Erweiterungsdroge → Mittel zur Penisvergrößerung		**Explanation:** "Penise-Erweiterungsdroge" is an incorrect translation of "penis enlargement," where "Penise" is not a standard German linguistic construction for "penis," and "Erweiterungsdroge" suggests a drug explicitly, whereas the reference uses "Mittel," which can mean "means" or "agent," more closely aligning with the original meaning. The error here is primarily in the compounded form of the word.
200m → 2000 → 200  	400m → 400 Millionen → 400  		**Explanation:** "2000" is a mistranslation of "200m" and "400 Millionen" is a mistranslation of "400m". These translation errors change the distances being referred to, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because they significantly alter the factual content of the sentence.
1. athlete → Sportler → Athleten	2. stripped → weggenommen → aberkannt  		**Explanation:** 	- "Sportler" (sportsperson) is a less specific translation for "athlete". Given the context where the reference uses "Athleten" (athlete), the candidate translation loses specificity.	- "weggenommen" (taken away) does not convey the same meaning as "aberkannt" (stripped) in the context of medals being rescinded or reversed due to rules violations. This significantly alters the legal or formal implication in the context of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the information that "Tichon lost his 2005 World Championship title nine years later due to testosterone doping involvement." There are some variations in wording, such as "seinen Titel 2005 der Weltmeisterschaft" versus "seinen WM-Titel von 2005," but these do not change the meaning. Therefore, according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, no significant translation errors are detected.
1. steroids → Steriden → Steroid	2. Champion → Champion → EM-Titel		**Explanation:** 	1. "Steriden" is a mistranslation of "steroids." The correct German translation in the context of doping substances should be "Steroid", matching the reference.	2. "Champion" is a mistranslation in this context. The candidate used "Champion" which does not specifically reflect "European Champion title." The reference correctly uses "EM-Titel," denoting "European Championship title," which fits better contextually.
bronze medal → Bronzemedale → Bronzemedaille		**Explanation:** "Bronzemedale" is a mistranslation as it is a misspelling of "Bronzemedaille". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it represents an incorrect German word. The correct word in the context of the translation is "Bronzemedaille". Rest of the translation maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence.
80.04m → 80,4 Millionen → 80,04 m  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "80,4 Millionen" (80.4 million) is a mistranslation of "80.04m" (80.04 meters). This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it drastically alters the magnitude and context of the figure.
Liu Hong → Liu Hongkong → Liu Hong  	world record holder → Weltrekordinhaber → Weltrekordlerin  	favourite → Begünstigte → Goldfavoritin  	tested positive → positiv zu gewinnen → positiv getestet
1. world champion → Weltmeister → Weltmeisterin		**Explanation:** The reference translation specifies "Weltmeisterin" (female world champion), while the candidate uses "Weltmeister" (male world champion). This changes the gender of the subject, breaching the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule related to gender consistency.		2. traces → Spuren → Hinweise		**Explanation:** The candidate uses "Spuren" (traces) which could be considered a mistranslation of "Hinweise" (indications) as conceptual accuracy diverges, according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.		3. dietary supplement → Ernährungszusatz → Nahrungsergänzungsmittel		**Explanation:** "Ernährungszusatz" (dietary additive) does not fully convey the intended meaning of "Nahrungsergänzungsmittel" (dietary supplement), altering the contextual accuracy in line with the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule. The intended substance aligns more with supplements rather than general additives.		4. ban → Verbot → Sperre		**Explanation:** In this context, "Verbot" (ban) is not accurately portraying "Sperre" (suspension), affecting the precise interpretation of the anti-doping actions, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with the reference translation. "eine österreichische Frau" (an Austrian woman) is a valid and more descriptive way to express "Österreicherin" (Austrian) in this context. Both terms accurately communicate the intended meaning. Additionally, there is no critical mistranslation or significant meaning change, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Thomas Schnöll → Thomas Schnörl → Thomas Schnöll  	Sprecherin → Sprecher → Sprecher  	der → sagte → sagte der  		**Explanation:** "Thomas Schnörl" is a mistranslation of "Thomas Schnöll," which is particularly significant given the role of a spokesperson. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Sprecherin" is a mistranslation of "Sprecher" because the reference specifies "Sprecher," indicating a male role, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The candidate misplaced the word "der" after "Sprecherin," causing a syntactical error that wasn’t in the source or reference. This disrupts the direct reportage structure and is thus considered a meaningful error.
cuts → Kürzungen → Schnittwunden  		**Explanation:** "Kürzungen" (reductions) is a mistranslation of "cuts" in this context, which should refer to "Schnittwunden" (cuts or lacerations), following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule since it changes the meaning from a physical injury to something unrelated.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "beabsichtigt" (intends/plans) and "thought of/considered/planned" can reasonably convey the intended meaning of planning to return home. Additionally, "Anfang September" (start of September) and "nach Hause zurückzukehren" (to return home) are consistent across the candidate and reference translations, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules. Hence, no single-word translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the same meaning as the source sentence and matches the reference in terms of key content. Both translations indicate uncertainty about whether Austrian citizens are affected by explosions in specific locations, adhering to the context appropriately. Following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no meaningful single-word translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence captures the intended meaning of the source sentence accurately. While there are differences in phrasing, both "Dem Vernehmen nach" and "so Schnöll" convey the idea of the statement being attributed to Schnöll. "damit" and "diesbezüglich" both refer to the resulting situation from the preceding information. The rest of the translation aligns well with the reference, maintaining the intended context and meaning, thus adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Bangkok → Bangkok → Bangkok		district → Nachtlebensraum → Ausgehviertel 		**Explanation:** 		1. "Bangkok" is correctly translated and should not be listed as a translation error. This was initially included incorrectly.	   	2. "Nachtlebensraum" is a mistranslation of "district." "Nachtlebensraum" (nightlife space) does not accurately convey the intended meaning of "Ausgehviertel" (entertainment or nightlife district). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "Nachtlebensraum" is not a standard term for a nightlife district.		Additionally, if there are no more errors, instead of adding the incorrect explanation of "Bangkok," I will update the output:		**Correct Output:**		district → Nachtlebensraum → Ausgehviertel
Holland → Holland → Niederländer  	Italians → Italien → Italiener  		**Explanation:** "Holland" is incorrectly used instead of "Niederländer" (Dutch people), and "Italien" (Italy) is incorrectly used instead of "Italiener" (Italians), violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The words need to refer to people rather than places.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences, with no single-word translation errors that significantly change the meaning of the message. While there are differences in phrasing, they are acceptable variations that do not violate any translation rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence. The reported event ("Bombenexplosion") and its occurrence ("frühen Morgen") are correctly conveyed. Although there are structural differences compared to the reference translation, they do not result in a significant change in meaning. Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, there are no errors to report.
Patong beach → Pong-Stränden → Patong  	occurred → war → ereignete sich  		**Explanation:** "Pong-Stränden" is a mistranslation of "Patong beach". "war" (was) is used instead of "ereignete sich" (occurred), which alters the meaning of the sentence in terms of the event's timing.
civil servant → Beamten → städtische Angestellte  		**Explanation:** "Beamten" (official) is a mistranslation of "civil servant," which in this context should refer to "städtische Angestellte" (municipal employee) for accuracy. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Beamten" might be more broadly understood, and fails to convey the specific context of a municipal employee.
device → Sprengstoff → Sprengsatz  	launched → gestartet → in die Luft gegangen  		**Explanation:** "Sprengstoff" (explosive) is a mistranslation of "device", which changes the type of object described. "gestartet" (started/launched) is a mistranslation of "launched" in this context, as the reference captures the intended meaning of detonating or going off with "in die Luft gegangen". Both errors violate **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** as they alter the sentence's meaning significantly.
south-east → Süd → Südost  	casualties → Opfer → Verletzte  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Süd" (south) instead of "Südost" (south-east), which changes the geographical location mentioned in the source, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Additionally, "Opfer" (victims) is used instead of "Verletzte" (injured or casualties), affecting the specificity of the affected individuals, which significantly impacts the meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence. While the reference translation uses a different structure, the essential meaning regarding a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin is preserved. This aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as there are no single-word mistranslation errors that significantly alter the sentence's meaning.
bomb attacks → Bombenanschläge → Bombenattentate  	signature → Unterschrift → Handschrift  	Army General → Army General → Armeegeneral  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Bombenanschläge" is a mistranslation of "bomb attacks" as "Bombenattentate" is more precise for the context, aligning with the reference. This affects **contextual accuracy**.	2. "Unterschrift" is a mistranslation of "signature" because in this context, "Handschrift" ("handwriting") is the correct metaphorical term for a pattern or distinctive mark in attacks, thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	3. "Army General" should be "Armeegeneral" to maintain correct terminology in German, aligning it with the reference translation for consistency and accuracy.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source sentence. Despite the difference in structure between the candidate and reference translations, both sentences accurately capture the original meaning. The candidate accurately translates "attacks" as "Angriffe," "assuming" as "gehen davon aus," and "coordinated" as "koordiniert." This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as the variations do not change the core meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation sufficiently conveys the meaning of the source sentence without any significant deviation in terms of meaningful content when compared to the reference. Both "Handlungen" (actions) and "Taten" (deeds) can represent the intended action carried out by the rebels, and there are no single-word errors that significantly alter the meaning of the sentence. This aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, indicating acceptable variation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation successfully conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. The word choices reflect the original input accurately, and the overall sentence structure matches the desired interpretation from the reference translation. There are no single-word errors that significantly alter the meaning. This adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. Each element of the sentence is accurately translated within the context, maintaining the intended meaning. Despite slight differences in phrasing (e.g., "ab" vs. "erklärte"), no single-word significantly alters the meaning, abiding by the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Es ist nur lokale Sabotage, beschränkt auf bestimmte Gebiete und Provinzen" closely aligns with the reference translation "Das ist nur örtliche Sabotage, die sich auf begrenzte Gebiete und Provinzen beschränkt." The words "lokale" and "örtliche" are near-synonyms, and "beschränkt auf bestimmte" vs. "die sich auf begrenzte beschränkt" are contextually equivalent, thereby adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. There are no significant changes in meaning, so no errors need to be identified.
bombs → abgeschossen → gelegt		**Explanation:** "abgeschossen" (fired/shot) is an incorrect translation of "set off". The reference uses "gelegt" (laid/placed/set off), which accurately conveys the action of detonating bombs. This is a significant change in meaning, satisfying the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
planned → bevorstehende → planned		notification → Notifizierungen → Hinweise  	security → Sicherheitsdiensten → geheimdienstliche  	attacks → Angriffe → Anschläge		**Explanation:** 	1. "planned" was mistranslated as "geplante," while "bevorstehende" was used in the reference, indicating the intended meaning as "forthcoming" or "upcoming."		2. "notifictation" was translated to "Notifizierungen," which is a direct but rare translation of "notification." The reference used "Hinweise," which aligns better with the context as "hints" or "indications" from intelligence services.		3. "security" was translated to "Sicherheitsdiensten," while the reference used "geheimdienstliche," aligning the context to refer more specifically to intelligence services.		4. "attacks" was translated as "Angriffe," while the reference used "Anschläge," which more accurately conveys the intent of violent attacks.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Each word in the candidate translation sufficiently captures the meaning of the source sentence. While the structure and some phrasing differ from the reference translation, the candidate maintains the intended message that the responsible party for the attacks remains unknown. Thus, no significant word-level translation errors are identified as per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule and the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
told → erzählte → wies  	increased → erhöhen → verstärken  	nightlife → Nachtbezirke → Vergnügungsviertel  		**Explanation:**  	1. "erzählte" (told, in the sense of narration) is a mistranslation of "told" in this context, where the police are giving instructions, and "wies" (instructed) is a more appropriate choice. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.  	2. "erhöhen" (increase) should be "verstärken" (strengthen) as the context implies strengthening security measures rather than just increasing them. This is necessary for the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.  	3. "Nachtbezirke" (night districts) is a mistranslation of "nightlife", which implies areas focused on entertainment and leisure, better captured by "Vergnügungsviertel" (entertainment districts), following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
small-scale → kleine → kleinere  	bombings → Bombardements → Bombenanschläge  		**Explanation:**  	"kleine" (small) is a mistranslation of "small-scale", which should be "kleinere" (a comparison implying 'smaller-scale' or 'less significant' bombings). "Bombardements" (bombardments) is a mistranslation of "bombings", which should be "Bombenanschläge" (bomb attacks or bombings) specific to the context of sporadic and targeted events. These changes follow the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule due to their impact on the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source sentence. The choice of "jahrelang" (for years) and "benutzt wurde" (was used) are valid translations that accurately capture the intended meaning of the reference translation. There are no single-word translation errors that significantly change the meaning in context.
issued → herausgegeben → empfiehlt  	recommendation → Empfehlung → Folge  		**Explanation:**  	1. "herausgegeben" (issued) is a mistranslation of "empfiehlt" (recommends), which changes the nuance of the action by the Foreign Ministry. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the source emphasizes a recommendation rather than a formal issuance.	2. "Empfehlung" (recommendation) does not fully convey the meaning of "Folge" (comply or follow), especially in the context used in the reference. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, since it distinctly modifies the tone and expected action by the audience.
1. Yala → Jala → Yala  	2. Vihear → ViHeare → Vihear  	3. alert → Sicherheitswachstum → Sicherheitsrisiko  		**Explanation:**  	- "Jala" is a mistranslation of "Yala" due to spelling error, and it does not match the intended province name, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "ViHeare" is a significant misspelling of "Vihear", which results in the wrong name being used.	- "Sicherheitswachstum" (security growth) is incorrect for "security alert", and should be "Sicherheitsrisiko" (security risk) in the context of issuing an alert, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
skirmishes → Hin und Her → Auseinandersetzungen  	advised → informiert → abgeraten  	travel → Einreise → Reisen  	districts → Bezirke → Provinzen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Hin und Her" (back and forth) is a mistranslation of "skirmishes" which means "Auseinandersetzungen" (conflicts/skirmishes). This does not sufficiently capture the confrontation implied by "skirmishes."	- "informiert" (informed) is a mistranslation of "advised" which in this context means "abgeraten" (advised against). The candidate changes the intended advice/warning to a simple informational statement.	- "Einreise" (entry) is a mistranslation of "travel" which should be translated as "Reisen" to align with the intent of advising against travel.	- "Bezirke" (districts) is a mistranslation of "Provinzen" (provinces), altering the scale and possibly geographic meaning, as "districts" may imply smaller regions compared to "provinces."
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While the candidate translation uses "Sicherheitswarnung" (security alert) and the reference translation uses "Sicherheitsrisiko" (security risk), both convey the intended heightened sense of security caution. The overall meaning remains intact and follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, thus not warranting any significant error report.
attacks → Angriffe → Anschläge		**Explanation:** "Angriffe" (attacks) and "Anschläge" (assaults) can have slightly different connotations. In the context provided, the word "Angriffe" significantly changes the nuance of the sentence compared to "Anschläge", which refers specifically to acts of terror or violent assaults rather than a general attack. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as using "Angriffe" might imply a broader range of attacks not specifically implied by "Anschläge".
military → militärischen → Militär  	large-scale → Großeinfluss → großen Einfluss  		**Explanation:** "militärischen" (military-related) should be directly translated to "Militär" (military) as in the reference. "Großeinfluss" (large influence) is an incorrect translation of "large-scale influence", which in the context is "großen Einfluss" (great influence) to convey the intended meaning. These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as they significantly alter the intended meanings.
Head → Leiter → Chef  	said → sagten → sagte  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Leiter" (leader) is a less precise translation of "Head" in this specific context. "Chef" (chief-head) is a more accurate term for the title "Head" of the junta, meeting the requirements of the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		2. "sagten" is the plural past form of "sagen" and appears incorrect here, as "Prayut Chan-o-cha" is a singular noun. The correct singular past form is "sagte", aligning better with the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule since it concerns the accuracy of verb conjugation in context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation correctly conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The words and structure used align well with the intended message in the reference translation. There are no significant single-word errors that alter the meaning of the original sentence, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
latent → latente → schwelenden  	resistance → Widerstandsbrüche → Aufstand  		**Explanation:** "latente" is a direct translation from "latent", but in the context of the reference, "schwelenden" (simmering) is more fitting to describe a developing situation. "Widerstandsbrüche" (resistance breaks) is an incorrect translation for "resistance" as "Aufstand" (uprising) properly conveys the meaning of organized opposition in the given context. Therefore, these words were identified as violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. The structure and wording differences do not contain any significant single-word mistranslations, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
shrine → Schirm → Schrein		**Explanation:** The word "Schirm" (umbrella) is a mistranslation of "shrine" (Schrein), significantly altering the meaning of the sentence in context. "Schirm" fails to convey the intended cultural and religious significance, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Angriff" and "Anschlag" can be used to translate "attack" in this context, and "jüngsten" and "jüngeren" both convey "recent" effectively. The candidate translation maintains the intended meaning without significant deviation, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the same meaning as the source and aligns closely with the reference translation. Both "rechtsgerichtete" and "rechte" accurately reflect "right-wing" in this context, and the slight structural differences do not alter the fundamental meaning. This complies with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** guidelines.
regional authorities → Regionalbehörden → Landesämtern	watchlist → Liste → Beobachtung		**Explanation:** "Regionalbehörden" (regional authorities) is a literal translation but does not translate the specific term "Landesämtern" which refers to specific state offices/agencies in Germany tasked with internal security. This is important for contextual accuracy. "Liste" (list) is a mistranslation of "watchlist." Although a "watchlist" is a type of list, it is a specific kind of list related to surveillance, which fits better with "Beobachtung" (observation/surveillance).
1. terms → Sicht → bei  	2. indicators → Anzeichen → Anhaltspunkte  	3. efforts → Bemühungen → Bestrebungen  	4. free → freie → freiheitliche  	5. order → Ordnung → Grundordnung  		**Explanation:** 	- "terms" is mistranslated as "Sicht," which should align more with "bei."	- "indicators" is translated as "Anzeichen," but "Anhaltspunkte" better fits the reference context.	- "efforts" is translated as "Bemühungen," but "Bestrebungen" better captures the intent.	- "free" is translated as "freie," but "freiheitliche" is more contextually accurate.	- "order" is translated as "Ordnung," while "Grundordnung" provides the necessary specificity in this context.
Muslim → Moslems → Zuwanderer islamischen  	vilified → ermordet → diffamiert  		**Explanation:** "Moslems" (Muslims) is a less precise translation given the more specific "Zuwanderer islamischen Glaubens" (migrants of Islamic faith) in the reference. However, this difference is minor as they're commonly understood similarly. Nonetheless, the more critical mistranslation is "ermordet" (murdered), which is a severe shift in meaning from "vilified" or "diffamiert" in German. This misrepresentation violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it drastically alters the sentence's intent.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "die Entwicklung" (the development) and "die Bewegung" (the movement) can be considered paraphrases depending on context as "monitoring" can involve both development and movement. The rest of the translation maintains the original meaning of the source sentence. Therefore, based on **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, no significant single-word errors are present.
Identitäre Bewegung → Identitäre Gruppe → Identitäre Bewegung  		**Explanation:** "Gruppe" (group) is a mistranslation of "Bewegung" (movement). The organization's name should remain "Bewegung" to accurately refer to the specific entity known as the "Identitäre Bewegung". This changes the identified organization in the sentence, contradicting the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. All other words in the candidate maintain the intended meaning of the source sentence.
multicultural → multikulturellen → Multikulti  	madness → Wahnsinn → Wahn  	fights → bekämpft → wendet sich gegen  	mass immigration → Masseneinwanderung → Massenzuwanderung  	foreigners → Ausländer → Überfremdung  		**Explanation:** 	- "multikulturellen" is a mistranslation of "multicultural", as "Multikulti" is more colloquially used in this context.	- "Wahnsinn" is a direct translation of "madness", but "Wahn" in the reference is a more nuanced term fitting the expression.	- "bekämpft" (fights) suggests direct confrontation, whereas "wendet sich gegen" (stands against) implies opposition without aggression, changing the tone.	- "Masseneinwanderung" is a literal translation of "mass immigration", but "Massenzuwanderung" used in the reference might carry a slightly different nuance within the given context.	- "Ausländer" (foreigners) does not carry the same connotation as "Überfremdung" (foreign infiltration or overforeignization), which is more aligned with the notion of "loss of identity".
protecting → schützen → beobachten  	federal states → Bundesstaaten → Bundesländern  	Identitäre → Identitäre → Identitären  		**Explanation:** "schützen" (protect) is a mistranslation of "beobachten" (observe/watch), which is the intended function in context. "Bundesstaaten" (federal states) is a mistranslation of "Bundesländern" (federal regions/states in Germany), the latter being more appropriate in the German context. Lastly, "Identitäre" is singular here, whereas "Identitären" is plural, matching the original English sentence, making it significant as it changes the number of the noun in the context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The phrase "worked closely with regional authorities" is effectively translated to "eng mit den regionalen Behörden zusammengearbeitet". Both the candidate and reference sentences contain slight variations in phrasing, but these do not significantly alter the intended meaning. Therefore, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no errors are reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation adequately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While there are some differences between the candidate and the reference translations, none of these differences significantly alter the meaning or demonstrate a clear mistranslation of individual words. The phrase "to approach their target group on their level" is translated as "ihre Zielgruppe auf ihr Niveau zu bringen", which is an acceptable rendering in the given context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "Im Allgemeinen" and "Generell" capture the essence of "In general." The candidate sentence retains the context of speaking to young people in their own language with references to "Popmusik," like the reference translation. Both capture the intended meaning correctly, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, and no significant mistranslations are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Radikale Islamisten und Rechtsextremisten tun das" accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although the structure differs slightly from the reference translation, there are no single-word translation errors that significantly alter the meaning. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule as it's a valid translation without introducing significant meaning changes.
calm → ruhige → betuliche  	actual → eigentliche → eigene  	matter → Thema → Sache  		**Explanation:** 	1. "ruhige" (calm) is a mistranslation of "betuliche" (fussy or prudish), which in context is meant to be a more specific description than just "calm".	2. "eigentliche" (actual) mistranslates "eigene" (own), altering the intended emphasis on possession or ownership.	3. "Thema" (topic) mistranslates "Sache" (matter), changing the meaning of what is being referred to in the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Both "emotionale Reaktion provozieren" in the candidate and "emotional ansprechen" in the reference are valid translations of provoking an emotional response. There is no significant change in meaning, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although the candidate and reference translations are different in structure, both accurately convey the meaning of the source sentence. The candidate translation uses "besonders gefährdet" (particularly vulnerable) and "junge Menschen" (young people), which aligns well with "Junge Leute" (young people) being "in besonderer Weise anfällig" (particularly vulnerable) in the reference. Hence, no single-word translation errors are detected according to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.
Bundesstaaten → Bundesländern → Bundesländer		**Explanation:** The term "Bundesstaaten" (states) is used in the candidate translation instead of "Bundesländern" (federal states), which is a more appropriate translation for the German context. This significantly changes the geographical reference and violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "Informationen" and "Erkenntnisse" are acceptable translations of "information" in this context, and the meaning is preserved. Thus, there are no significant single-word translation errors according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence when compared with the reference translation. The critical components, such as "constitutional protection" ("verfassungsmäßigen Schutz"), "potential contact" ("potenzieller Kontakt"), and the concept of relevance from a certain point, align well between the sentences. There are no single-word mistranslations that significantly alter the meaning or context.
depends → hängt → kommt  	focus → Fokus → Zielrichtung  	people → Extremisten → Personen  		**Explanation:**  	- "hängt" is a mistranslation of "depends", which is more accurately represented as "kommt" in this context, respecting the idiomatic phrase "Es kommt darauf an".	- "Fokus" is a mistranslation of "focus", where "Zielrichtung" better captures the intended meaning of changing the organization's general focus or direction.	- "Extremisten" is a mistranslation of "people", while "Personen" is a broader term that captures the general intent before specifying that these people are extremists.
decisive → Entscheidende → ausschlaggebend  	people → Leute → Personen  	exert → kontrollieren → Einfluss haben  		**Explanation:** 	- "Entscheidende" (important/deciding) is a mistranslation of "decisive", which should be "ausschlaggebend" (decisive/decisive factor) in this context. This changes the emphasis of significance in the sentence, violating **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.	- "Leute" (people) is a less formal term than "Personen" (persons), and the reference uses "solche Personen" to match the more formal tone, violating **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.	- "kontrollieren" (control) is a mistranslation of "exert influence", which should be translated as "Einfluss haben" (have influence), changing the nature of the verb significantly and violating **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence "Das wurde nicht zur Kenntnis genommen" is a reasonable translation of "This has not been noted," as it conveys the correct meaning. Comparing this to the reference translation, "Dies sei nicht erkennbar," which suggests something is not recognizable, both sentences convey a similar sense of lack of recognition or acknowledgment. As the meanings align sufficiently and fit the context, there are no significant single-word translation errors to report. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence and aligns well with the reference translation. Any differences between the candidate and reference translations are minor and do not significantly alter the overall meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "rechtsgerichtete terroristische Strukturen" for "right-wing terrorist structures," which, while not identical to "rechtsterroristische" in the reference translation, conveys the same meaning. Additionally, the repetition of "existieren" might seem redundant, but it doesn't result in a significant change in meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Thus, no single-word significant translation errors are detected.
Old School Society → Alten Schulgesellschaft → Old School Society  	Freitaler → Freitler → Freitaler  		**Explanation:** "Alten Schulgesellschaft" (Old School Society) is mistranslated as "Alten Schulgesellschaft", suggesting a literal translation where it is kept in English in the reference. This violates **Focus on Single-Word Errors** where the correct phrase is not translated literally. "Freitler" is a mistranslation of "Freitaler", changing the name of the group, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
right-wing → rechtsgerichtete → rechtsterroristische  	terrorist → Terrorgruppen → Gruppierungen  	small → kleine → Kleinstgruppen  	attacks → Angriffe → Anschläge  	on → auf → gegen  	asylum seekers → Asylbewerber → Asylsuchende  	refugee shelters → Flüchtlingsunterkünfte → Flüchtlingsheime  		**Explanation:**  	- "rechtsgerichtete" (right-wing directed) does not convey the same level of extremism or specificity as "rechtsterroristische" (right-wing terrorist). 	- "Terrorgruppen" (terror groups) doesn't explicitly convey "terrorist groups" in the original's specific political context, which "Gruppierungen" (groups) captures in the reference, maintaining context while "right-wing" already specifies their nature.	- "kleine" (small) translates directly from the source, but "Kleinstgruppen" (very small groups) conveys what the translation aimed for more accurately.	- "Angriffe" (attacks) should be "Anschläge" (more akin to terror attacks), which is a more precise match to the reference.	- "auf" (on) in "Attacks on" compared to "gegen" (against) can notably affect intent in a potential misinterpretation.	- "Asylbewerber" (asylum applicants) versus "Asylsuchende" (asylum seekers) reflects a nuanced but present distinction in German, with the latter more closely aligning with "seekers."	- "Flüchtlingsunterkünfte" (accommodations) is acceptable but "Flüchtlingsheime" (homes/shelters) more closely aligns with the reference translation's context.
Germany-wide → deutsch-europäische → deutschlandweite  	Europe-wide → deutsch-europäische → europaweite  	control → Kontrolle → Steuerung  		**Explanation:** 	1. **Germany-wide** is mistranslated as "deutsch-europäische" (German-European) instead of "deutschlandweite" (Germany-wide). This changes the scope of the control being discussed and thus violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	   	2. **Europe-wide** is similarly mistranslated as "deutsch-europäische". It should be "europaweite" to maintain the intended scope of control.	   	3. **control** is translated as "Kontrolle" instead of "Steuerung", which is used in the reference. Although "Kontrolle" can mean control, in this context "Steuerung" is more precise and aligns better with the source meaning, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the meaning of the source sentence accurately. Variations such as "bisher bestehenden" vs. "bisherigen" and "über soziale Netze" vs. "in sozialen Netzen" are acceptable within context, and the overall meaning remains consistent with the source and reference sentences. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation aligns accurately with both the source and reference translations, preserving the intended meanings and context of the original sentence. The words used in the candidate translation appropriately cover the meaningful content without introducing significant variations or errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "erschreckend" (frightening) is a valid translation of "frightening." Although the reference uses "das Besorgniserregende," the candidate sentence accurately conveys the intended meaning. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where the meaning is preserved, allowing for alternative valid expressions.
suspected → verdächtigt → Tatverdächtigen  	carrying out → Durchführung → Attacken  	members → Mitglieder → Anhänger  	far-right scene → rechtsextreme → rechten  		**Explanation:** 		1. "verdächtigt" (suspected) is inaccurate as it generally refers to being regarded as suspicious, whereas "Tatverdächtigen" means "suspects," highlighting those accused of an act, in this context, better conveying the legal implication.	2. "Durchführung" (execution) deviates from the context of "attacks" since it implies carrying out a planned action, whereas the correct term in this sentence context would be directly related to the "Attacken" (attacks).	3. "Mitglieder" (members) could be misleading since it implies belonging to a group, whereas "Anhänger" (followers/supporters) better fits the context of individuals without suggesting formal membership, consistent with its usage in similar discourse about sociopolitical alignment.	4. "rechtsextreme" (far-right) can overly emphasize extremism alone in such contexts over "rechten", which more broadly communicates being part of the political right wing, aligning with the tone of the reference.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Each element of the candidate translation conveys the intended meaning of the source and is consistent with the reference translation. The differences in wording do not lead to significant changes in meaning, so no errors are reported, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
sensation → Internet-Senation → Internethit  		**Explanation:** "Internet-Senation" is a mistranslation of "Internet sensation" when compared to the reference "Internethit". The incorrect word "Internet-Senation" is an improper use in German and does not exist in the same context, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Despite differences in structure, no single-word errors significantly distort the meaning. "Olympische Sportler" is a valid translation of "Olympic athletes," and "Schlagzeilen" accurately reflects "headlines." The core message remains intact with no critical single-word mistranslations identified.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "mutigen Leistung" (brave performance) and "mutige Auftritt" (brave appearance) preserve the meaning of the source sentence. Although there are slight variations in phrase choice, the translation of meaning remains intact according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, there are no significant translation errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** All the words used in the candidate translation have equivalents in the source sentence that fit the context, and the meaning is preserved. Although "Aquatikzentrum" and "Aquatics Center" differ, their meanings are equivalent, and the rest of the translation accurately conveys the original message. Hence, there are no errors based on the provided instructions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the overall meaning of the source sentence and aligns closely with the reference translation. The variations in wording do not result in significant differences in meaning. The sentence remains accurate within the context, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
Habte → Habitat → Habte  	sensation → Sendung → Hit  		**Explanation:** "Habitat" is a mistranslation of the name "Habte", which significantly changes the subject of the sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The use of "Sendung" (broadcast/program) instead of "Hit" (sensation) alters the meaning significantly by misrepresenting "sensation" in this context, ensuring high accuracy in following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
24-year-old → 24-Jährigen → 24-Jährige  	completed → abgewickelt → beendet  	heat → Hitze → Vorlauf  	competitor → Wettbewerber → schnellster  	taking place → abgewickelt → belegte den 59. Platz  		**Explanation:**  	- "24-Jährigen" is a mistranslation given the plural form used here, while "24-Jährige" is correctly singular, matching the source and reference.  	- "abgewickelt" (processed) is a mistranslation of "completed" in this athletic context, where "beendet" (finished) is more accurate.  	- "Hitze" (heat, in the context of temperature) is a mistranslation; "Vorlauf" (heat, in the context of a race) is correct.  	- "Wettbewerber" (competitors generally) should specify "schnellster" (fastest) to convey the correct meaning of "next-fastest competitor."  	- "abgewickelt" also tries to translate "taking place," but it does not convey the intended meaning of ranking; "belegte den 59. Platz" (taking the 59th place) is appropriate.
sporty → sportliche → sportliche  	figure → Persönlichkeit → Figur  	eye → Auge → Aufmerksamkeit  		**Explanation:**  	1. "sporty" is translated as "sportliche" in both candidate and reference, which is correct. However, "figure" is mistranslated as "Persönlichkeit" (personality) instead of "Figur", significantly changing the meaning. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** as the focus should be on physical appearance, not character trait.	2. "Attention" is mistranslated as "Auge" (eye) instead of "Aufmerksamkeit". This changes the manner in which the media is interested. Thus, it satisfies the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as the core aspect of media interest has been altered.
24-year-old → Teilnahme → 24-Jährige  		**Explanation:** "Teilnahme" (participation) is a mistranslation of "24-year-old", indicating confusion between a person and an action. This is a significant error that violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Ethiopian → Äthiopier → Äthiopier  	swimming federation → Schwimmbadföderation → Schwimmverband  		**Explanation:** "Äthiopier" is correctly translated, so it remains in the list as a necessary part of the phrase context. "Schwimmbadföderation" (swimming pool federation) is a mistranslation of "swimming federation," which should be "Schwimmverband" (swimming federation) to correctly convey the meaning. The focus remains on the single-word error in the context of "Schwimmbadföderation" to "Schwimmverband."
given out → überlassen → verteilt  		**Explanation:** "überlassen" (entrusted) is a mistranslation of "given out". The intended action is to distribute or hand out, which is captured by "verteilt" (distributed). This error fits the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it alters the intent of the sentence. The rest of the sentence is sufficiently accurate in meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both the candidate and reference translations convey the same meaning as the source sentence, with "Athleten" as an acceptable synonym for "Sportler" and the structure of the sentences well aligned. There are no significant errors affecting the meaning of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "vorbereitet" for "prepared" and the reference uses "macht sich fertig", both of which accurately convey the idea of preparing for a race. Since the meaning is preserved, there are no significant single-word translation errors according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
first → Namensnamen → ersten  	nicknames → Namensnamen → Spitznamen  		**Explanation:** "Namensnamen" is a mistranslation of "first nicknames". It doubles the word "name" and fails to convey the intended meaning of "first nicknames". "Spitznamen" accurately reflects "nicknames". Both identified errors significantly alter the original message and comply with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. The word "bald" and "die Runde" do not contain any significant contextual errors.
Robel the whale → Robel die Wale → Robel der Wal		**Explanation:** "die Wale" (the whales) is a mistranslation of "the whale", which changes the meaning from singular to plural. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it affects the intended characterization of the individual.
reference → Bezug → Anlehnung  	flabby → abenteuerlichen → Wohlstandsbauch  		**Explanation:** "Bezug" (reference) is a mistranslation of "reference", which should be "Anlehnung" in this context. "Abenteuerlichen" (adventurous) is a mistranslation of "flabby", referring to a "Wohlstandsbauch" (paunch), a term that's contextually more appropriate. These errors significantly alter the intended meaning, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
100 metre freestyle → 100-Meter-Freetyp → 100 Meter Freistil		**Explanation:** "Freetyp" is not an appropriate translation for "freestyle" in the context of swimming. The correct term in German is "Freistil". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it misrepresents the swimming category.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence is a valid translation of the source sentence. "Vergleiche wurden auch angestellt" is a faithful translation of "Comparisons were also made," and "Eric the Aal" is an accurate translation of "Eric the Eel" in this context. Therefore, there are no significant errors based on the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. The phrases used in the candidate, such as "lenkte die Aufmerksamkeit der Medien," are an acceptable way to express drawing media attention. There are no single-word errors significantly changing the sentence meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
performance → Stückwärme → Auftritt		**Explanation:** "Stückwärme" (segment heat) is a mistranslation of "freestyle heat." The key error here is the translation of "heat" in the competitive sense. However, since it's part of a multi-word phrase, and "Freistil" accurately translates "freestyle," the error focuses on "heat." In this context, "heat" refers to a portion of the competition, not physical warmth or segmental heat, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
cheering → Gerangel → angefeuert		**Explanation:** "Gerangel" (scramble/tussle) is a mistranslation of "cheering" (anfeuern). This significantly changes the context from a positive reception to a chaotic or negative scenario, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Therefore, it constitutes a significant translation error.
22 years old → 22 Jahre alt → 22-Jährige  	learnt → lernen → lernte  	distance → lange → Distanz  		**Explanation:** "22 Jahre alt" is a literal translation and misses the concise form "22-Jährige", which maintains the specific context of age. "lernen" (infinitive "to learn") instead of "lernte" (past tense "learnt") incorrectly conveys ongoing action rather than past completion. "lange" (long) is unable to independently convey the concept of "distance", lacking specificity and changing the meaning.
front-row → Vorreiter → vordersten  	stunning → betäubende → atemberaubenden  		**Explanation:** "Vorreiter" (pioneer) is a mistranslation of "front-row". It violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "pioneer seat" does not make sense contextually. "Betäubende" (numbing) is a mistranslation of "stunning", which significantly changes the adjective's meaning to suggest a negative connotation, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
downtown's → der Heimatstadt → in der Innenstadt  	Society → Gesellschaft → Society  	holds → hat → hält  		**Explanation:** 	1. "der Heimatstadt" (of the hometown) is a mistranslation of "downtown's", which should reflect "in der Innenstadt" (in the downtown). This error changes the locational context.	2. "Gesellschaft" (company/society in a general sense) is used instead of "Society," which refers to "Society of Architectural Historians", a specific proper noun and organization name; it should remain "Society" in the translation.	3. "hat" (has) is a mistranslation of "hosts"/"holds" in this context, where "hält" (holds) aligns better with hosting an event.
Bertram Goodhue → Bertram Goodhue von → Bertram Goodhue  	Pfeifers Vereins → Pfeifers Vereins → Pfeiffer Associates  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Bertram Goodhue von" in the candidate translation suggests "Bertram Goodhue of" rather than indicating it refers to a design by Bertram Goodhue. The correct translation should not alter the name or attribution in this context.	2. "Pfeifers Vereins" is a mistranslation of "Pfeiffer Associates". "Vereins" (association or club) is not the correct translation for "Associates" in the context of a firm or company name, which is significant to the meaning.
21 → (missing) → 21  	Southwestern → Southwest → Southwestern  		**Explanation:**  	1. The date "21" is missing in the candidate translation. This changes the meaning by omitting the crucial information about the date, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.  	2. "Southwest" is a mistranslation of "Southwestern". "Southwest" suggests a different name and meaning than "Southwestern", which is a significant contextual error according to the **Identify Mistranslations** rule.
attendees → Besatzungen → Besucher  	tour → reisen → besichtigen  	Central → Zentrale → Mittelsaal  	Period → Zeiträume → Stilzimmer  	Cactus → Caks → Kaktus  	Lounge → Room → Lounge  	Tea → Room → Teesalon  		**Explanation:** "Besatzungen" (crews) is a mistranslation of "attendees" (Besucher) as it refers to a completely different group. "Reisen" (travel) is incorrect for "tour" (besichtigen), as it suggests a different activity. "Zentrale Halle" (central hall) changes the meaning from "Mittelsaal" (central or main room in this context). "Zeiträume" (time periods) conflicts with "Period Rooms" (Stilzimmer), which refers to rooms styled in a certain historical period. "Caks" is a typographical error and mistranslation of "Cactus" (Kaktus). "Room" does not fit in the context of a "Lounge". Similarly, "Room" as a translation of "Tea Room" misses the nuance of "Teesalon" associated in German with a specific type of room.
advance → Vorstandskarten → Vorverkaufstickets		**Explanation:** "Vorstandskarten" translates to "board tickets," which incorrectly conveys the type of tickets being referenced. "Vorverkaufstickets" is the correct translation for "advance tickets" which specifically means tickets bought in advance. This is a significant error as it refers to a different kind of ticket altogether, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
open → Flickenteppich → offene  	makeover → Farce → Makeover  		**Explanation:** "Flickenteppich" (patchwork rug) is a mistranslation of "open", which significantly alters the description of the type of space being referred to. Additionally, "Farce" (farce) is a mistranslation of "makeover", changing the intended meaning from a positive transformation to something ridiculous. Both errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation, "Die Feier des 90. Geburtstags der Zentralen Bibliothek" sufficiently captures the original "Celebrating L.A.'s Central Library's 90th birthday," and "mit - was sonst? - einem neuen Buch" aligns well with both the source and the reference sentence. Although there are structural differences and slight variations, none of the individual words significantly alter the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no word is demonstrably incorrect.
owner → Eigentümers → Inhaberin		**Explanation:** The word "Eigentümers" (of the owner) in the candidate translation is a mistranslation, as it implies theft of the owner themselves rather than theft from them, which is the intended meaning of "owner of a shop" in the source. "Inhaberin" (owner) in the reference translation is used correctly in context to mean that theft occurred from the shop owned by the person.
Geretsry → Geretsried → Geretsriederin  	Grundbuchfenster → Grundbuchfenster → Fenster im Erdgeschoss  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Geretsry" is a misspelling of "Geretsried", which misidentifies the place, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. It should instead reference the town "Geretsried" or its derivative "Geretsriederin".	2. "Grundbuchfenster" is incorrect for "ground-floor window", as "Grundbuchfenster" implies a "land register window", not a window on the ground floor. The correct translation is "Fenster im Erdgeschoss", which adheres to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
returns → zurückkehrte → zurückkam  	till → sie → Kasse  		**Explanation:** "zurückkehrte" (returned) is a more literal translation but doesn't fit the context of the reference sentence as "zurückkam" does, which is a more natural expression for returning. "sie" (they/she) is a mistranslation of "the till", which should refer to "Kasse" (cash register/till) in this context. The focus should be on the cash register, not the person, changing the entity involved.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Es gab keine Spur des Täters" successfully conveys the intended meaning of "There was no trace of the perpetrator." Although the reference sentence uses a different grammatical structure, the key elements such as "Spur" (trace) and "Täter" (perpetrator) are accurately translated, aligning with both the source meaning and the significant content of the reference translation. Thus, it adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule by maintaining the correct context and meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although the translations are differently phrased, the candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning that the shop did not have CCTV (video surveillance). The key element "CCTV" is correctly retained in the candidate sentence. Given the instructions, no significant translation errors at the word level are present.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Trumpf" (trump card) is not the correct translation for the proper noun "Trump".
Donald → Donald Trumpp → Donald Trump		**Explanation:** The only error is with "Donald Trumpp", where "Trumpp" is a misspelling of "Trump". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes the proper name, which is significant in identifying a person. 		Other than this, the candidate translation maintains the intended meaning quite well, hence no further single-word errors are listed.
Trump → Trumpp → Trump		**Explanation:** "Trumpp" is a clear spelling error and mistranslation of "Trump," which needs to be corrected to match the reference and source, adhering to the **Identify Mistranslations** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "würde Urlaub machen" (would go on holiday) captures the essence of the source sentence. Although the reference uses a different structure, "fahre dann eben in den Urlaub", which means "go on holiday," the candidate sentence is still contextually and semantically correct. According to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, the differences here are stylistic rather than errors.
mind → übel → egal  	lost → verloren hätte → verliert  		**Explanation:** "übel" (badly) is a mistranslation of "mind", which changes the sentiment expressed. This is a meaningful error since it alters the intention, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "verloren hätte" (had lost) incorrectly translates "lost" in this context, as it suggests hypothetical past loss rather than the possibility of losing, violating **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.
doesn't → macht → reiche		said → sagte Trumpf → sagte Trump		**Explanation:** "macht" (make) is a mistranslation of "doesn't make it", changing the intent of the sentence significantly by not capturing the sense of success implied in "make it". This identification follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump", incorrectly altering the name, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
1. candidate → Kandidaten → Kandidatin	2. terrorism state → Terrorismus-Staat → Terrormiliz		**Explanation:** "Kandidaten" (male candidate) is a mistranslation of "candidate" when referring to Hillary Clinton, who is female, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The phrase "islamischen Terrorismus-Staat" (Islamic terrorism state) is a significant mistranslation of "Islamic State", which should be "Terrormiliz Islamischer Staat" (Islamic State militia), as it changes the entity being referred to.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "In seiner Partei wächst der Widerstand weiter" captures the overall meaning of the source sentence accurately. The words used are synonymous or contextually appropriate and do not change the intended meaning conveyed by the source and reference sentences. Thus, according to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, there are no significant single-word translation errors.
service → Postdienst → Post  	gets → tritt → steigt  	on board → an Bord → in den Handel  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Postdienst" (postal service) could be considered broadly synonymous with "Post" (post), but they differ in usage within the context, with "Post" being more concise and appropriate.	2. "tritt" (steps or enters) is a mistranslation of "gets". The reference uses "steigt" (gets on board/involves), which is more contextually fitting.	3. "an Bord" (on board) is a literal mistranslation here. The idiomatic expression "steigt...ein" used in the reference suggests involvement or initiation in a business context, which "in den Handel" (into the trade) captures better.
Deutsche → Detusche → Deutschen  	electric → elektrische → Elektro  	truck → Lkw → Zustellfahrzeug  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Detusche" is a typographical error for "Deutsche", meaning "German". This is a straightforward misspelling, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "elektrische" (electric) is valid but "Elektro" (specifically related to electric vehicles) is more accurately used in the reference translation to denote the type of vehicle. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule because "Elektro" specifically aligns with the context of vehicles.	3. "Lkw" (truck) is a general term whereas "Zustellfahrzeug" (delivery vehicle) specifies its use, aligning more accurately with the source sentence describing a specific type of vehicle in action. This reflects a **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** approach by focusing on the vehicle's function.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Despite some differences in structure and wording between the candidate and the reference translations, both versions convey the same essential meaning: that other companies have a clear interest in the vehicle. As there are no individual words in the candidate translation that significantly misrepresent the source material, this follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
postal service → Postdienst → Post  	electric vehicle → Elektroauto → Elektrofahrzeug  		**Explanation:** "Postdienst" (postal service) can be misunderstood as a service rather than the organization "Post", which significantly impacts the meaning as it personalizes the organization itself rather than a service it provides. "Elektroauto" (electric car) is a narrower term than "Elektrofahrzeug" (electric vehicle), which affects the broader sense intended in the reference. This change of meaning follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
(soon → bald → in Kürze)  	(company → Unternehmen → Konzern)  	retailing → Einzelhandel → Handel  	vehicle → Fahrzeugs → Transporter  		**Explanation:**  	- "bald" can be a mistranslation in some contexts compared to "in Kürze," which is specific here. However, without significant contextual difference, it could be acceptable, but needs noting.	- "Unternehmen" does not fully capture the size implied by "Konzern."	- "Einzelhandel" (retail) as a noun is not the exact verb form "Handel" captures (retailing) as an action; hence it's a misalignment.	- "Fahrzeugs" (vehicle) is broader than "Transporter," which could mean a specific type of vehicle needed in the context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence conveys the intended meaning with acceptable variations in wording. "Postdienst" and "Post" both refer to the postal service, and "sein Elektrofahrzeuge" is equivalent to "ihre Elektro-Transporter" in the given context. The rest of the candidate sentence effectively matches the relevant details in the source and reference, so the translation maintains the intended message.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Despite differences in phrasing, the candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source and aligns well with the reference translation. Both translations convey the intention to sell to third parties, and the role and timing of the quote are accurately reflected. Therefore, per the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, no single-word translation errors are identified.
StreetScooter → StreetScoter → StreetScooter  	parcels → Parallelen → Päckchen  		**Explanation:** "StreetScoter" is a misspelling of "StreetScooter", which is a significant error as it refers to a specific product name. "Parallelen" (parallels) is a mistranslation of "parcels", significantly altering the meaning and not fitting contextually.
demand → Forderungen → Nachfragen  		**Explanation:** "Forderungen" (claims/demands) is a mistranslation of "demand" (in the sense of requests or need) in this context. The correct translation should be "Nachfragen" (inquiries), which preserves the intended meaning of requests from tradesmen. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Forderungen" suggests claims rather than requests.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon comparison of the candidate translation with the source and reference sentences, all key elements are preserved, and the meaning is effectively conveyed. The candidate translation accurately communicates the intent and details of the source sentence, respecting the rules from the instructions, such as **Handle Ambiguity Carefully**, since synonyms and variations in phrasing do not lead to any meaningful mistranslations.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essence of the source sentence. While "vehicles" is translated as "Fahrzeuge" instead of "Autos," both are valid translations. Additionally, the phrase "per level" is not explicitly translated in the candidate, but the overall meaning of planning to use factories for production is maintained, and "pro Jahr" (per year) captures the frequency aspect. No significant meaning change is detected, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
company → Deutschen → Konzern  	increase → erhöhen → vergrößern  	size → Größe → Flotte  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Deutschen" (Germans) is a mistranslation of "company", which changes the subject of the announcement. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it refers to the wrong entity.	2. "erhöhen" (increase) is incorrectly used for "vergrößern" (expand). While both can mean increase, in this context, "vergrößern" aligns with the expansion of a "fleet" (Flotte) rather than the cars themselves.	3. "Größe" (size) is not the correct translation of "fleet" in this context. The Source refers to increasing the number of cars (a fleet expansion), not the physical size of individual vehicles.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence "Wir machen einen sehr, sehr starken Schritt in Richtung 2020", sagte er Ende Juli. aligns well with the meaning of the source sentence and the reference translation. All the words in the candidate sentence accurately capture the intended meaning of the source. Therefore, no significant mistranslation is detected following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The terms "gesamte" and "komplette" both accurately translate "entire" in this context. Thus, no meaningful translation errors that impact the overall meaning of the sentence are present, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses different words for some elements but overall conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. "Unterwegs" (out and about) is a valid translation for "aktiv" in this context, and "den Straßen Deutschlands" (Germany's roads) is equivalent to "Deutschlands Straßen". Therefore, no mistranslations are detected according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
managing director → Verwaltungsdirektor → Führung  	steps down → fällt zurück → tritt ab  	figures → Zahlen → Geschäftszahlen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Verwaltungsdirektor" (administrative director) is a mistranslation of "managing director." The term doesn't accurately reflect the seniority of the position compared to "Führung" (leadership/executive).	2. "fällt zurück" (falls back) does not convey the intended meaning of "steps down," which implies a resignation or stepping aside, unlike "tritt ab."	3. "Zahlen" (numbers) is less specific than "Geschäftszahlen" (business figures), which is necessary for capturing the context of financial results.
managing director → Geschäftsführers → Chef		**Explanation:** "Geschäftsführers" (executive director) is a mistranslation of "managing director". While the terms can be related depending on the organizational context, "Chef" is the more accurate translation for the specific role being replaced in this sentence. Additionally, "tritt an die Stelle" (takes the place of) does not convey the intended meaning of "replacing" as clearly as "tauscht aus" (is replacing), but since this is a phrase-level issue and the significant word difference is captured with "managing director", only the significant single-word error is reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Sein Rücktritt kam schnell, aber es war keine vollkommene Überraschung" is a valid way to express the source sentence. "schnell" (swiftly) and "plötzlich" (suddenly) are synonymous in this context, and both "sein Rücktritt" (his resignation) and "Die Rücktritte" (the resignations) can be contextually appropriate depending on whether the reference narrows or expands the subject compared to the source. The phrase "keine vollkommene Überraschung" conveys the same idea as "nicht ganz überraschend" in terms of it not being a complete surprise. Therefore, no significant translation errors are detected.
Matthias Harmann → Matthias Hartmann → Matthias Hartmann  	geschäftsführenden Direktoren → Vorstandschef → Managing Director  		**Explanation:**  	1. **"Matthias Harmann" → "Matthias Hartmann":** The candidate has a name mismatch, as it should be "Matthias Hartmann" as per the reference.	2. **"geschäftsführenden Direktoren" → "Vorstandschef":** In the candidate, "geschäftsführenden Direktoren" (Managing Directors) is a mistranslation compared to "Vorstandschef" (Managing Director) due to the plural form, which changes the specific role being referred to in the context.
figures → Zahlen → Geschäftszahlen  	managing director → Geschäftsführers → Unternehmensführung  	fifth → fünfte → Nummer Fünf  	personal → persönlichen → personellen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Zahlen" (numbers) inaccurately translates "figures" given the context of disappointing business performances, where "Geschäftszahlen" (business figures) better captures the intended financial context.	2. "Geschäftsführers" (managing director) is a literal translation but contextually "Unternehmensführung" (corporate management) aligns with a broader management departure.	3. "fünfte" (fifth) does not convey the notion of being ranked as "Nummer Fünf" (number five), which ties to the position or status in a competitive ranking.	4. "persönlichen" (personal) incorrectly translates the intent behind "personellen" (personnel-related), referring to changes involving staff or leadership.
GfK → GGKK → GfK  	managing → Geschäftsführer → Vorstands-Chef  		**Explanation:** "GGKK" is a mistranslation of "GfK", as they refer to a specific entity which should remain unchanged. "Geschäftsführer" (managing director) is a potential translation for "managing director," but it doesn't match "Vorstands-Chef" (executive chairman) in the reference. In this context, "Vorstands-Chef" seems to convey a more precise executive position based on the reference.
managing director → Leiter → Vorsitzende  	supervisory board → Überwachungsrates → Aufsichtsrats  	supervisory committee → Überwachungsausschuss → Aufsichtsgremium  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Leiter" (leader) is a mistranslation of "managing director," which should be "Vorsitzende" in this context.	2. "Überwachungsrates" (monitoring council) is a mistranslation of "supervisory board," which should be "Aufsichtsrats."	3. "Überwachungsausschuss" (monitoring committee) is a mistranslation of "supervisory committee," which should be "Aufsichtsgremium." These mistranslations significantly alter the intended meaning.
Hausruckinger → Hauruckinger → Hausruckinger		**Explanation:** "Hauruckinger" is a mistranslation of "Hausruckinger", which is a name. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it alters proper identification of the individual mentioned in the sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the reference translation in meaning. Key terms such as "officially", "role of 'board spokesman'", and "Hartmann's successor" are accurately translated, and there are no significant deviations that change the intended meaning of the source sentence. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as the function of specific words like "nehmen" or "werden" may vary slightly, but the overall sentence retains its correct meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence. The key terms and concepts, such as "different viewpoints" and "long-term business direction," have been accurately translated. The variation between "Rücktritt" (resignation) and "Rücktritte" (resignations) is minor and does not significantly alter the meaning in context, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, no significant translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translates "company spokesman" to "Unternehmenssprecher," "did not give" is expressed as "hat keine weiteren... vorgetragen," and "on Friday" is correctly placed as "am Freitag." Despite differences in word order, the meaning aligns with both the source and reference sentences, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and the reference translation both adequately convey the meaning of the source sentence. The differences in structure do not introduce significant meaning changes. Hence, according to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, there are no notable single-word translation errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence accurately, without any significant mistranslations. While there are differences in wording between the candidate and reference translations, the overall message remains consistent, complying with the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the same meaning as the source sentence. "steht an der Spitze" (stands at the top of) is a valid translation of "headed up" in this context, as it conveys leadership. Additionally, there is no significant semantic difference introduced by "der GFK" versus "an der GfK-Spitze". Therefore, no mistranslations exist that significantly alter the meaning of the sentence, aligning with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the main elements of the source sentence, and there are no significant single-word mistranslations when compared to the reference translation. Since the reference translation takes a slightly different interpretation, no direct word-by-word match exists, but the candidate translation remains faithful to the original sentence. Thus, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules, no single-word errors are identified.
every → jeder → irgendwann  		**Explanation:** The word "jeder" (every) in the candidate translation is a mistranslation of "eventually" as conveyed by "irgendwann" in the reference translation, which is meant to indicate that every shareholder would become unsettled at some unspecified future time. This significantly affects the meaning of the temporal aspect, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
quants → Better → Quandts  		**Explanation:** "Better" is a mistranslation of "quants", which refers to individual names "Quandts." This is a significant error that distorts the intended meaning, adhering to the **Identify Mistranslations** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
losses → Viertel → Verlusten		**Explanation:** The candidate translation incorrectly translates "quarters" as "Viertel" in "vorherigen Viertel". The correct translation in this context (financial quarters) is "Quartalen" as seen in the reference. This error violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Viertel" typically refers to non-financial quarters or sections. "Verlusten" is correctly translated in the candidate sentence, maintaining the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The words chosen in the candidate translation are synonymous or near-synonymous with those in the reference translation, and no significant change in meaning occurs. Despite some differences in phrasing, none of these affect the sentence's intended message, satisfying the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the meaning of the source sentence accurately. Both "Im Vergleich zu den ersten sechs Monaten des Jahres" and "Bezogen auf das erste Halbjahr" refer to comparing timeframes accurately. "war der Umsatz ... um 3,4% zurückgegangen" aligns sufficiently with "schrumpfte der Umsatz ... um 3,4 Prozent". Therefore, no significant errors in single words are detected according to the given criteria.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Words such as "geringere" (reduced), "Wert" (value), "aufgrund" (because of), "schwierigen Wirtschaftsklimas" (difficult economic climate), and "insbesondere" (in particular) all appropriately reflect their respective counterparts in the source sentence. While the syntax differs somewhat from the reference translation, the candidate maintains the intended meaning and context. Therefore, no meaningful single-word mistranslations are detected.
goodwill → Ratifizierung → Firmenwertabschreibungen  		**Explanation:** "Ratifizierung" (ratification) is a mistranslation of "goodwill amortisation". This significantly changes the meaning since "ratification" does not convey the concept of writing off an asset or amortization, which "Firmenwertabschreibungen" correctly does. Therefore, it violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the meaning of the source sentence. While there are some variations in wording compared to the reference translation, such as "erzielte" for "had made," these do not alter the fundamental meaning. The capitalization variance in "GFK" vs. "GfK" is also not significant in terms of meaning. The key financial terms "profit" and the amount "19.7 million" are correctly translated, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
incident → Zufälle → Unfälle  	slips → gleitet → rutscht  	ditch → Mündung → Graben  		**Explanation:**  	1. **incident → Zufälle → Unfälle:** "Zufälle" (coincidences) is a mistranslation of "incident". The context suggests a car accident, which "Unfälle" (accidents) accurately captures.	2. **slips → gleitet → rutscht:** "gleitet" (glides) is a mistranslation of "slips". The reference uses "rutscht" (slips), which better conveys the sudden and unintended movement of the bus.	3. **ditch → Mündung → Graben:** "Mündung" (mouth) is a mistranslation of "ditch". The word "Graben" (ditch) is the correct term for a roadside trench.
1. coach → Menschen → Reisebusses		**Explanation:** "Menschen" (people) is a mistranslation of "coach" (Reisebusses), which significantly changes the meaning by omitting the specific vehicle involved in the accident, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the reference emphasizes the type of vehicle.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence. The word "Fluggäste" (air passengers) in the candidate can be considered a valid translation of "passengers" in some contexts and does not significantly alter the intended meaning when compared to "Insassen" (occupants, passengers) in the reference. The rest of the translation aligns well with the reference and conveys the same information, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
66-year-old → 66-jährige → 66 Jahre alte  	bus driver → Busfahrer → Fahrerin  	swerved → vermeiden → ausweichen  	oncoming → kommenden → entgegenkommen  	lorry → Lastkraftwagen → Laster  		**Explanation:**  	1. "66-jährige" (66-year-old) is missing the element of "years" which is included in "66 Jahre alte".  	2. "Busfahrer" (bus driver) is incorrect because of gender; the source specifies a female driver, which matches "Fahrerin".  	3. "vermeiden" (avoid) is a mistranslation of "swerve," which typically involves a sudden change of direction to avoid something, captured by the word "ausweichen" in the reference.  	4. "kommenden" (coming) does not fully convey the directionality of "oncoming," which is more accurately captured by "entgegenkommen".  	5. "Lastkraftwagen" (generic term for truck) is not incorrect, but "Laster" is the more traditionally used term for "lorry" in the reference context.
came → abgerissen → kam  	skidded → gestürzt → rutschte  	ditch → Kehrtwende → Graben  		**Explanation:**  	1. "abgerissen" (torn off) is a mistranslation of "came off". The word "abgerissen" does not fit the context here and changes the meaning significantly.  	2. "gestürzt" (fell) is not a correct translation for "skidded". "Rutschte" (skidded) appropriately describes the vehicle's movement in the intended context.  	3. "Kehrtwende" (u-turn) is a mistranslation of "ditch", which significantly affects the sentence's meaning, changing an obstacle where the vehicle ended up.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the meaning of the source sentence effectively. The words "positioniert" and "Lage" both refer to the positioning of the bus, and "Menschen" and "Personen" both mean people, conveying the correct context. Additionally, "allein" (alone) and "selbstständig" (independently) are synonymous enough in this context. Thus, no errors are significant enough to be reported.
freed → freigelassen → befreite		**Explanation:** "freigelassen" (released) is a mistranslation of "freed" in this context. "Freigelassen" implies a voluntary release, which does not fit the contextual meaning intended by "freed," as typically used for emergency rescue operations like those performed by a fire brigade. Hence, it violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Six → Sechs → Sechs  	rescue vehicles → Rettungsfahrzeuge → Rettungswagen  	ambulance → Krankenwagen → Notarztwagen  	attendance → anwesend → kamen  	scene → Unfallort → Unfallort  	no.2 road → zweiten Straße → Landesstraße 2  		**Explanation:**   	1. **rescue vehicles → Rettungsfahrzeuge → Rettungswagen:** "Rettungsfahrzeuge" (rescue vehicles) significantly changes the meaning in this context, as "Rettungswagen" (ambulances) specifies emergency medical vehicles rather than general rescue vehicles. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the context requires medical emergency response.	2. **ambulance → Krankenwagen → Notarztwagen:** "Krankenwagen" translates to "ambulance," but "Notarztwagen" is a more specific type of emergency ambulance, suggesting the presence of a paramedic or doctor, which fits the reference translation more appropriately under the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	3. **attendance → anwesend → kamen:** The candidate translation "anwesend" (present) implies mere presence, while "kamen" (arrived) in the reference implies an action performed, important for understanding the dynamics, thus altering the intended meaning under **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.	4. **no.2 road → zweiten Straße → Landesstraße 2:** "zweiten Straße" (second street) is a mistranslation of "no.2 road," where "Landesstraße 2" (highway/road number 2) conveys the specific road name, which is crucial under the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
1. passengers → Fahrgäste → Reisenden	2. Krummhörn's → Krummörn → Krummhörner		**Explanation:**  	- "passengers" is translated as "Fahrgäste" instead of the reference translation "Reisenden". Both "Fahrgäste" and "Reisende" can be used for "passengers," but "Reisende" fits better contextually with traveling, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.	- "Krummhörn's" is translated as "Krummörn," which misses the possessive form. Therefore, "Krummörn" is incorrect compared to the reference "Krummhörner". This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** as the possessive form indicates the district belonging to Krummhörn.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While the structures of the candidate and reference translations are different, the meaning is preserved. Analyzing the candidate translation: "Ersatzbus" (replacement bus), "Busgesellschaft" (coach company), and relevant verbs and pronouns match the context and intent. Given the lack of singular words inappropriately changing the meaning, the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule confirms the translation's accuracy, hence no errors are listed.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and the reference translation both convey the same overall meaning, including the request to the lorry driver and witnesses to contact the police. While there are slight differences in word choice, such as "Lkw-Fahrer" versus "Lasterfahrer" (both mean lorry driver), and "alle Zeugen" versus "mögliche Zeugen" (all witnesses versus possible witnesses), these do not constitute significant changes in meaning that would trigger a translation error under the rules provided.
Zultenberg → Lalltenberg → Zultenberg  	Lindenberg → Lopp → Lindenberg  		**Explanation:**  	- "Lalltenberg" is a mistranslation of "Zultenberg". The source mentions "Zultenberg" which the candidate translation replaced incorrectly.	- "Lopp" in the candidate translation is present in a position where "Lindenberg" should be mentioned according to the source and reference.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. Although the structure is different, each component like "sewage fee" ("Abwasserentgelte"), "sewage works" ("Abwasseranlagen"), "raise" ("angehoben"), and "improvement works" ("Verbesserungsarbeiten") aligns well within the context. Thus, there are no meaningful single-word translation errors present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "geschätzten Berechnung" for "estimated calculation", which is contextually acceptable. "Sich belaufen auf" for "will come to" and "Abwassergebühren" for "sewage fees" are also acceptable translations in this context. Therefore, there are no significant mistranslations that change the intended meaning, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
mayor → Bürgermeister → Bürgermeister  	Steinhäuser → Steinkott → Steinhäuser  	district → Bezirksverwaltung → Landratsamt  	budget → Haushaltsplans → Haushalts  	sewage → Kläranlagen → Abwasseranlagen  		**Explanation:** 	1. "mayor" is correctly translated as "Bürgermeister" in both candidate and reference, so no error is reported for this term.	2. "Steinhäuser" was mistranslated as "Steinkott," which significantly changes the meaning since it's a person's name.	3. "district administration" translated as "Bezirksverwaltung" does not match "Landratsamt," which is more precise for "district office" in this context.	4. "budget" is mistranslated as "Haushaltsplans," a minor variation and acceptable. The focus is on structure precision where "Haushalt" is more apt.	5. "sewage plants" was translated as "Kläranlagen," while "Abwasseranlagen" is closer to the meaning, as it includes all wastewater facilities, not just the treatment plants.
market town → Marktstadt → Markt  	break even → durchbrechen → kostendeckend  		**Explanation:** "Marktstadt" is translated as "market town" but the intended context refers to "Markt" (market), which is more accurate given the reference. "durchbrechen" (break through) is an incorrect translation of "break even," which should be "kostendeckend" (break even). These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules because the meanings are significantly altered in context.
Welschenkahl → Welchenkahl → Welschenkahl  	Zultenberg → Ultenberg → Zultenberg  		**Explanation:**  		1. "Welschenkahl" is mistranslated as "Welchenkahl". This is a critical mistranslation because it refers to a proper noun—a specific location—which must be correctly translated to preserve precise geographical references.	   	2. "Zultenberg" is mistranslated as "Ultenberg". Proper nouns like place names must be accurately translated. It affects the clarity of the text regarding the locations involved.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Die Gebührenerhöhungen betragen 48 bis 67%" conveys the same meaning as the source sentence. The choice of verbs "betragen" (amount to) and "liegen zwischen" (range between) are contextually acceptable equivalents for expressing a range of values, handling ambiguity as per the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Both variants correctly show the range of percentage increases, thus no significant translation errors are present.
administrative → Verwaltungsdirektor → Verwaltungsleiter  	committee → Ausschuss → Gremium  	sewage plants → Klärwerke → Abwasseranlagen  	market town → Marktstadt → Marktgemeinde  		**Explanation:** 		1. **administrative**: "Verwaltungsdirektor" means "administrative director," whereas "Verwaltungsleiter" means "administrative manager/director." The translation "Verwaltungsdirektor" is a specific title, while "Verwaltungsleiter" is more aligned with the expected translation. Since the meaning shifts slightly, it's marked.		2. **committee**: "Ausschuss" and "Gremium" both mean committee, but they imply slightly different formalities or types of groups. "Gremium" is more neutral and commonly used in formal contexts as fitting with "Gremium."		3. **sewage plants**: "Klärwerke" refers to water treatment plants, whereas "Abwasseranlagen" directly translates to "sewage facilities," aligning precisely with the source.		4. **market town**: "Marktstadt" translates to market city, differing in scale or designation. "Marktgemeinde" conveys the idea of a market town, being more rural and community-focused, fitting the context accurately.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. "Überfinanzierung und Unterfinanzierung" correctly represents "overfunding and underfunding," and "aus dem vorangegangenen Berechnungszeitraum ausgeglichen" correctly represents "will be balanced out from the previous calculation period." The slight differences in word choice between the candidate and the reference translation are acceptable variations and do not constitute mistranslations. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where different wording does not alter the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately represents the source sentence's meaning. The phrase "very small amount of waste" is appropriately translated to "sehr geringen Abfallmenge" and "cubic metres a pear" to "Kubikmeter pro Jahr," acknowledging the likely typo "pear" which should have been "year." Since the candidate translation conveys this correctly, no errors are marked, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
expenses → Kosten → Aufwendungen  	critical → kritische → notwendige  	major → erheblich → gravierend  		**Explanation:** "Kosten" is a mistranslation of "expenses" which should be "Aufwendungen" in the context to convey the idea of expenditures. "kritische" is a mistranslation of "critical" which more accurately translates to "notwendige" (necessary) in this context. "erheblich" (considerable) poorly conveys the impact intended by "major," which is better captured by "gravierend" (grave/serious). These errors change the intended meaning, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
amount → Abwassermenge → Abwasseraufkommen  	plants → Kraftwerken → Anlagen  		**Explanation:** "Abwassermenge" (amount of sewage) is a close translation but "Aufkommen" (volume/amount) is a more accurate term, aligning with the contextual meaning of the source and reference. "Kraftwerken" (power plants) is incorrect, as the context refers to sewage treatment plants, properly translated as "Anlagen". These errors significantly affect the sentence's accuracy, addressing the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses words that capture the essence and meaning of the source sentence when compared to the reference. Variations like "vorhergehende Berechnungszeitraum" and "zurückliegenden Kalkulationszeitraum" are acceptable variations for "previous calculation period". Similarly, "Renovierungs- und Reparaturarbeiten" aligns in context with "Sanierungs- und Reparaturaufwendungen", and the overall meaning is preserved in the candidate translation. Thus, no significant single-word errors are detected.
plant → Werk → Anlage	plants → Werke → Anlagen		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Werk" (factory/work) instead of "Anlage" (plant/facility) for "plant," and "Werke" (factories) instead of "Anlagen" (plants), which changes the intended meaning in the context significantly.	
(ventilation → Abfallbehandlungsanlage → Belüftungsanlage)  	(mechanical → Abfallbehandlungsanlage → mechanische)  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation missed the mention of "mechanical ventilation system," instead erroneously translating it as "Abfallbehandlungsanlage" (waste treatment plant), which is incorrect. "Belüftungsanlage" (ventilation system) and "mechanische" (mechanical) are key components in the context and significant for understanding the sentence correctly.
1. conveyor → Fernleitungsnetz → Förderanlagen  	2. completely → vollständig → von Grund auf  	3. clarification → Klärungsstellchen → Klärteich  	4. pond → Teichbehandlungsanlage → Teichkläranlage  	5. dredged → abgezogen → ausgebaggert  	6. sewage sludge → Klärschlamm → Klärschlamm (checked for consistency, correct)  	7. incorporated → integriert → eingebaut  		**Explanation:**  	- "Fernleitungsnetz" (long-distance pipeline network) is incorrect for "conveyor" (conveying system/equipment) at Welschenkahl, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "vollständig" (completely) doesn't match "von Grund auf" (from the ground up), altering the intensity and thoroughness of the needed overhaul, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Klärungsstellchen" (a diminutive/incorrect form of clarification) is not an acceptable term for "clarification pond," violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "Teichbehandlungsanlage" (pond treatment plant) alters the intended meaning from "pond clarification," violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "abgezogen" (deducted) is incorrect and does not fit the intended action of "dredged" which should be "ausgebaggert."	- "Klärschlamm" remains correct for "sewage sludge," as both the candidate and reference translations use the same term. 	- "integriert" (integrated) versus "eingebaut" (built-in) can signal different installation approaches, violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
extraordinary → außerordentlichen → außerordentlichen  	expenses → Ausgaben → Aufwendungen  	perpetual → ständigen → fortgeschriebenen  	support → Unterstützungs- → Betreuungs-  	maintenance → Unterhaltskosten → Wartungskosten  	calculation → Berechnungs- → Kalkulations-  		**Explanation:**  	- "extraordinary" is correctly translated as "außerordentlichen" in both the candidate and reference. No error here.	- "expenses" is translated as "Ausgaben" in the candidate but "Aufwendungen" in the reference. Both can mean expenses or expenditures, but "Aufwendungen" suggests a formal financial context, aligning it closer to the reference.	- "perpetual" is translated as "ständigen" in the candidate, but "fortgeschriebenen" in the reference. "Fortgeschriebenen" (updated/forwarded) fits the financial context better than "ständigen" (constant), indicating a mismatch.	- "support" is translated as "Unterstützungs-" in the candidate but "Betreuungs-" in the reference. "Betreuungs-" usually implies ongoing, exhibited oversight or management fitting the reference context better.	- "maintenance" is translated as "Unterhaltskosten" in the candidate, but "Wartungskosten" in the reference. "Wartungskosten" specifically refers to maintenance costs in technical contexts, fitting better.	- "calculation" as "Berechnungs-" in the candidate compared to "Kalkulations-" in the reference, both mean calculation but "Kalkulation" is slightly more specific in financial or planning context, which can influence meaning perception.		Following instructions, translation meaning shifts and contextual misalignments are recognized, particularly in financial terminology nuances.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with the source and reference sentences in terms of meaning. "Dasselbe" and "Das Gleiche" are acceptable variations for "The same," and "Stromkosten" and "Stromkosten" is consistent across all versions. Other elements like "früheren Berechnungen" (previous calculations) and "weit unter dem derzeitigen Niveau" (far below their current levels) convey the same meaning as the source, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, no significant translation errors are present.
Steinhäuser → Steinfallen → Steinhäuser  		**Explanation:** "Steinfällen" is a mistranslation of "Steinhäuser". This significantly changes the meaning because it alters the name of the person who is making the statement, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. The name must be consistent across translations to maintain the context and accuracy.
Schmidt → sich ausdehnte → ergänzte  	sewage → Kläranlagen → Abwasseranlagen  		**Explanation:** 		1. "sich ausdehnte" (expanded) is a mistranslation of "Schmidt expanded" as it suggests physical or metaphorical expansion. The intended meaning is that Schmidt is adding information, as captured by "ergänzte" (added).		2. "Kläranlagen" (sewage treatment plants) is a more specific term than the broader "Abwasseranlagen" (sewage facilities). Here, however, it matches the source, meaning the word itself is correct, but considering consistency with the reference, the intention is to reflect a more generalized sense as "Abwasseranlagen".
Steinhäuser's → Steinfett → Steinhäuser	wastewater association → Abfallverbandes → Abwasserzweckverbandes	Friesenbachtal → Friesenbaal → Friesenbachtal  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Steinfett" is a mistranslation of "Steinhäuser." In proper names, translation errors are critical as they refer to specific entities.  	2. "Abfallverbandes" (waste association) is a mistranslation of "wastewater association" (Abwasserzweckverbandes). This difference significantly alters the context related to water management.  	3. "Friesenbaal" is a typographical error of "Friesenbachtal," which is a geographic name and should be precise.
Bulgaria → Postämter → Bulgarien  	Posts → Inflation → verbucht  		**Explanation:** "Postämter" (post offices) is a mistranslation of "Bulgaria", which significantly alters the meaning of the sentence. "Inflation" appears where "Posts" should have been translated as a verb like "verbucht" (posts) to denote recording economic data, which disrupts the contextual meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although the word order differs slightly between the candidate and reference translations, all significant meanings are preserved. The translation follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as both the candidate and reference translations are valid expressions of the source sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the meaning of the source and matches the reference translation closely. The phrase "das ist der höchste Wert seit Jahren" is an acceptable rendition of "this is the highest value in years," albeit slightly different in wording, but it conveys the same meaning. Similarly, "eingestellt wurden" (was posted) is a reasonable synonym for "verbucht wurden" (was posted) within this context, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
-0.8% → 0,8% → -0,8%		**Explanation:** The candidate translation reverts the negative sign from the source, altering the original meaning of the sentence. This error is significant as it changes the inflation rate from a decrease to an increase, which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by significantly altering the intended message.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence with appropriate terminology and context. The key terms like "Verbraucherpreisindex" (consumer price index), dates, percentages, and the explanation of inflation are correctly translated. Although there are minor structural differences between the candidate and reference translations, they do not result in a change of meaning. This aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule as the meaning remains intact, and no significant errors are identified.
-0.2% → 0,2% → -0,2 %	-0.2% → 0,2% → -0,2 % 		**Explanation:** The candidate translation incorrectly renders "-0.2%" as "0,2%" in both instances. This significantly alters the meaning of the statistics reported, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as the negative sign is crucial in the context of financial data.
miscellaneous → missbräuchliche → verschiedene  	recreation → Erholung → Freizeit  		**Explanation:** "missbräuchliche" (abusive) is a mistranslation of "miscellaneous," which should be "verschiedene" (various). This changes the category's meaning significantly, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "Erholung" (recovery) is a mistranslation of "recreation," which should be "Freizeit" (leisure), fitting the intended meaning in context and following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
furnishings → Unterbringung → Mobiliar  	household equipment → Haushaltsausrüstung → Haushaltsgeräten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Unterbringung" (accommodation) is a mistranslation of "furnishings", which refers to furniture items, not accommodation.	2. "Haushaltsausrüstung" (household equipment) is a close translation but lacks the specificity of "Haushaltsgeräten", which is more accurately aligned with "household equipment" as used in this context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation aligns well with the reference translation with regard to the main elements of the sentence. Even though there are differences in the wording ("Wohnraum" vs. "Wohnungen", "Elektrizität" vs. "Strom", etc.), these variations do not distort the meaning of the sentence in a significant way, considering the context and the overall sentence structure. Therefore, no critical single-word translation errors are present.
Caricature → Caricatur → Karikatur		**Explanation:** "Caricatur" is not a valid German word; the correct translation for "caricature" is "Karikatur", following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the meaning and context of the source sentence. The words "Anime", "rassistisch" (racially), and "unsensibel" (insensitive) maintain the intended meaning, aligning well with the reference translation. Any small differences, such as the use of "einige" versus "manche" or "inspiriert von" versus "Anime-inspiriert", are acceptable variations and do not significantly alter the meaning.
lens → Lenkungsmittel → Filter  	identity → Identität → Identitäten  	is → ist → grenzt  		**Explanation:** "Lenkungsmittel" (steering device) is a mistranslation of "lens," which in this context is understood as a tool or filter, significant in meaning. "Identität" (identity) is a mistranslation of the plural form "Identitäten," misrepresenting the number. "ist" (is) inaccurately translates the concept of bordering on the absurd, which should be conveyed with a term like "grenzt" (borders).
pineapple → Angelpunkt → Ananas  		**Explanation:** "Angelpunkt" (fulcrum or pivotal point) is a mistranslation of "pineapple." This significantly changes the meaning, as the original sentence suggests transforming into various whimsical entities, including a "pineapple." This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the source context references a fruit, not a concept or point of significance.
lenses → Lizenzen → Filter  	blunt → unverschämt → unverblümte  	feature-warping → patrouilling-Werkzeuge → eigenschaftsverdrehende  	selfies → Selten → Selfies  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Lizenzen" (licenses) is a mistranslation of "lenses", which should be "Filter" in this context, as the sentence refers to tools used in photography, not licenses.	2. "unverschämt" (outrageous) is a mistranslation of "blunt", which should be "unverblümte" (blunt/direct).	3. "patrouilling-Werkzeuge" does not make sense for "feature-warping tools", which should be "eigenschaftsverdrehende Tools". The focus error is on "patrouilling" which is not related to "feature-warping".	4. "Selten" (rarely) is a mistranslation of "selfies", which should remain "Selfies" as it is a widely recognized loanword in German.
step → Schritt → Tritte		**Explanation:** "Fehlschritte" (missteps) is a mistranslation of "Fehltritte." While "Schritt" (step) and "Tritt" (stride) are related, "Fehltritte" carries the meaning of mistakes or blunders in this context, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it does not fit the intended nuance of public errors.
1. lenses → lässt → Filter  	2. drawn → Kritik an der Tatsache üben → Kritik auf sich gezogen  	3. app → Apfel → App  	4. blackface → Schwarze Gesicht → Blackface  	5. whitened skin tones → Hitzentonen → weiße Haut  		**Explanation:**  	- "lässt" (lets) is a mistranslation of "lenses" which are specific to Snapchat and not the verb 'lets'. The correct target word is "Filter".	- "Kritik an der Tatsache üben" (to criticize the fact) is a mistranslation of "drawn criticism". The direct translation that accurately captures the meaning is "Kritik auf sich gezogen".	- "Apfel" (apple) is a mistranslation of "App" (application), causing a significant change in meaning.	- "Schwarze Gesicht" (black face) is not used in the context of the controversial concept "blackface" and confuses the meaning. The contextually appropriate word is "Blackface".	- "Hitzentonen" has no recognizable meaning related to "whitened skin tones," with "weiße Haut" (white skin) being the intended translation of "whitened skin tones".
lens → Lied → Filter  	slanted → Auge → Schlitzaugen  	puffy → faule → aufgedunsene  	cheeks → Zähne → Wangen  		**Explanation:**   	1. "Lied" (song) is a mistranslation of "lens". The correct term is "Filter", as indicated in the reference sentence.	2. "Auge" (eye) is incorrect for "slanted", which means "Schlitzaugen" in the context of describing eyes.	3. "faule" (rotten) is a mistranslation of "puffy". The correct term in the context is "aufgedunsene".	4. "Zähne" (teeth) should be "Wangen" (cheeks), which is consistent with the source and reference.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence accurately translates the source sentence into German. The variations in expression, such as "hindeuten" versus "hinwiesen" and "Vielfalt" versus "Diversität," do not significantly alter the meaning and are considered acceptable under the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules. The overall meaning and context are preserved.
reports → Berichten → Berichte  	said → hieß → mitteilte  	feature → Merkmal → Feature  		**Explanation:**  	- "Berichten" is the dative plural form of "report" and is incorrectly used instead of "Berichte" (reports) in the nominative or accusative plural in the context.	- "hieß" is a mistranslation of "said" and does not accurately convey the intended meaning of "mitteilte" (communicated/stated), which fits the context of reporting/disclosure.	- "Merkmal" (trait) is a mistranslation of "feature", which in the tech context is often correctly translated as "Feature". The use of "Merkmal" alters the technical meaning applied to a software feature.
lense → Lippen → Filter  	explanation → Erklärung → Entschuldigung  	anime characters → Tiere → Anime-Charaktere  
observers → rassistische → Außenstehende  	experienced → Lichtungen → erlebt haben  	lens → Lichtungen → Filter  	hurtful → schreckliche → verletzende  		**Explanation:** 	- "rassistische" (racist) is a mistranslation of "observers", as "rassistische" changes the focus from those affected by racism to being the perpetrators. This alters the meaning inappropriately.	- "Lichtungen" (clearings) is a mistranslation of both "experienced" and "lens". "Experienced" should be "erlebt haben", and "lens" should be "Filter". Both are significant errors changing the sentence meaning.	- "schreckliche" (terrible) is a mistranslation of "hurtful", which should be translated as "verletzende". This affects the severity and nature of the stereotypes mentioned.
anime → Tiere → Anime  		**Explanation:** "Tiere" (animals) is a mistranslation of "anime", which changes the noun that is being compared. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the intended comparison involves anime, not animals.
1. Korean American → Amerikanischer → Koreanisch-Amerikanische  	2. art student → Kunststudent → Kunststudentin  	3. tweet → Teufel → Tweet  	4. lens → Linsen → Filter  		**Explanation:**   	- "Amerikanischer" (American) mistranslates "Korean American" as it omits the "Korean" aspect.	- "Kunststudent" (art student) mistranslates "art student" as "studentin" needs to be feminine according to the context.	- "Teufel" (devil) is an incorrect translation of "tweet".	- "Linsen" (lenses) mistranslates "lens" as "Filter" is more appropriate in this context.
difficult → schwer → schwierig  	gross → grobe → widerlichen  	comparison → über → Gegenüberstellung  		**Explanation:**		1. "schwer" is a mistranslation of "difficult", whereas "schwierig" captures the nuance intended in the source better.  	2. "grobe" (coarse) is a mistranslation of "gross", which changes the level of negativity intended. "widerlichen" (disgusting) better reflects the intended meaning.  	3. "über" (over/about) is incorrectly used for "comparison", which should be "Gegenüberstellung" (comparison), capturing the context of comparing side by side accurately.
yellowface → gelbe Gesichter → Gelbgesicht  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "gelbe Gesichter" (yellow faces) instead of "Gelbgesicht" (yellowface). "Yellowface" is a specific term and should be translated as "Gelbgesicht." This mistranslation violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules because the candidate translation does not accurately capture the intended cultural critique associated with the term "yellowface".
tripwires → Trippen → Stolperdrahte		**Explanation:** "Trippen" does not accurately translate "tripwires." The correct term in this context is "Stolperdrahte," which describes a tripping hazard, fitting the intended metaphorical meaning. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The rest of the translation maintains the meaning and is not erroneous.
corporate boardrooms → Verwaltungsräten → Konferenzräumen  		**Explanation:** "Verwaltungsräten" (boards of directors) is a mistranslation of "corporate boardrooms". It fails in the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** as it suggests a different location than intended. "Konferenzräumen" (conference rooms) is more contextually accurate for "corporate boardrooms" as it describes locations where business meetings typically occur.
racially diverse → rassistischer → diverser		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses the word "rassistischer" (more racist) instead of "diverser" (more diverse). This significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, as it incorrectly characterizes the younger audience in a negative light, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Snapchat → eine → Snapchats   	lenses → Snapchat → Filtern  	Katie → Klatte → Katie  		**Explanation:**	1. "eine" is a mistranslation of "Snapchat's" which should relate to the possessive context, aligning with "Snapchats" in reference.	2. "Snapchat" is mistranslated since it should reflect "lenses", translated as "Filtern" in the reference to specify the component creating the image.	3. "Klatte" is a clear typographical error replacing "Katie", changing the name completely.
Ms. → M. → Zhu  	delete → streichen → löschen  		**Explanation:** The candidate incorrectly uses "M." to abbreviate "Ms.", which should have been translated as "Zhu" directly, as the reference translation omits "Ms." altogether. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since "M." is not the standard abbreviation for "Ms." in German and does not fit the context. Additionally, "streichen" (delete in a different context, often meaning "to paint" or "to cross out") is a mistranslation of "delete," which in this context should be "löschen" as per the reference translation, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
race-related → rassistischen → rassenbezogene  	hiring practices → Anstellung → Einstellungspraktiken  		**Explanation:** "rassistischen" (racist) is a mistranslation of "race-related". The term "race-related" is neutral and does not inherently convey a negative connotation like "racist". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it alters the context of controversies. "Anstellung" (employment) is a mistranslation of "hiring practices", which misses the nuance related to the specific processes or methods. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it changes the intended focus of diversity concerns.
Ms. → M. → Zhu	ended → endete → beendete	essay → Essay → Aufsatz	#DeleteSnapchat → "Deletsenapchat" → #DeleteSnapchat		**Explanation:** "M." is an error as the correct rendering of "Ms." in the reference is simply "Zhu," avoiding the prefix due to cultural differences in using courtesy titles. "endete" (ended) misrepresents "beendete" (finished), which is more contextually accurate. "Essay" is mistranslated as "Aufsatz" which is the appropriate term. Finally, the translated hashtag "Deletsenapchat" isn't correct as hashtags generally remain untranslated.
people of color → Farbleuten → Menschen mit anderen Hautfarben  	people of color → Farbmänner → Menschen mit anderen Hautfarben  		**Explanation:** "Farbleuten" and "Farbmänner" are mistranslations of "people of color". In the context, "Menschen mit anderen Hautfarben" provides a more accurate and contextually appropriate translation. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as these terms could have a significant impact on meaning and social implications.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence. Although there are minor variations, such as "Beobachter" versus "teilen" and "weitgehend" versus "größtenteils," none of these deviations significantly change the overall meaning. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where both candidate and reference translations convey the intended meaning accurately.
figures → Zahlen → Zahlen	diversity → Vielfalt → Diversität	noting → nimmt zur Kenntnis → weist hin		**Explanation:**		1. "Figures": The term "Zahlen" is accurately translated in both the candidate and reference translations, so no mistranslation here.		2. "Diversity": "Vielfalt" is used in the candidate translation, while "Diversität" is used in the reference. Both words are acceptable translations of "diversity," but due to different contextual usage in business settings ("Diversität" is more common in discussions about staff diversity), this is identified as a significant error that could create confusion.		3. "Noting": The phrase "nimmt zur Kenntnis" in the candidate translation means "to acknowledge" rather than "to indicate" or "to note" as in "weist hin" used in the reference. This is a meaningful error, as it changes the connotation of the company's statement regarding its status.
racial → rassischen → kulturellen  	recruiter → Rekrutierer → Personalverantwortlichen  	inclusion → Eingliederung → Integration  		**Explanation:** "rassischen" (racial) is a mistranslation of "cultural", which alters the intended scope of diversity. "Rekrutierer" (recruiter) does not capture the nuanced role of "Personalverantwortlichen" (HR manager or person responsible for personnel), affecting the understanding of the hire's responsibilities. Finally, "Eingliederung" (incorporation/assimilation) differs from "Integration", which is the appropriate word to describe efforts of incorporating diverse groups while maintaining diversity, affecting the overall message.
(keep → schließen → geschlossen)		**Explanation:** "schließen" (to close) is a mistranslation of "keep" (to keep closed), which reverses the intended action implied in the source sentence. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by incorrectly suggesting an action to close the account rather than maintaining its closed status.
Military → Durchführung → Militärführung  	Distorted → Durchführung → verfälsche  	Officials → Durchführung → Militärbeamte  	Intelligence → Durchführung → Geheimdienstinformationen  	Congressional → Congressial → Kongresses  	Panel → Panel → Ausschuss  	Says → Says → stellt fest  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation has numerous mistranslations. The translation for "Military Officials" is completely mistranslated as "Durchführung," which does not convey the intended meaning. "Distorted" is similarly misrepresented as "Durchführung," losing the specific meaning. "Intelligence" is not translated, and "Congressional" is mistranslated as "Congressial," presenting a spelling error. "Panel Says" is also not translated. Each of these errors changes the sentence meaning significantly, so they must be reported.
1. Officials → Beamte → Militärangehörige  	2. Central Command → Zentralbefehlshaber → United States Central Command  	3. intelligence reports → Nachrichtenberichte → nachrichtendienstliche Informationen  		**Explanation:**		1. "Beamte" (officials) is translated as "Militärangehörige" (military personnel) in the reference, which is more specific in this context, referring to the specific group involved with the intelligence reports.	2. "Zentralbefehlshaber" (central commanders) is a mistranslation of "Central Command," which is a specific military organization. The reference correctly maintains the name "United States Central Command."	3. "Nachrichtenberichte" (news reports) is a mistranslation of "intelligence reports," which should be "nachrichtendienstliche Informationen" to accurately convey the specific type of reports being altered, adhering to the intelligence context.
1. Armed Services → bewaffnete Dienste → Streitkräfte	2. Intelligence → Geheimdienste → Geheimdienst	3. Defense Appropriations → Verteidigungszuweisungen → Wehrbudget	4. Central Command → Zentralkommunikations → Central Command	5. found → fand statt → berichtet von	6. doctoring → dokumentiert → veränderten		**Explanation:**  	1. "Armed Services" is translated as "bewaffnete Dienste" instead of "Streitkräfte", which changes the intended meaning of military services.	2. "Intelligence" is translated as "Geheimdienste", suggesting multiple agencies, whereas "Geheimdienst" (singular) corresponds to the context of a committee.	3. "Defense Appropriations" translated as "Verteidigungszuweisungen" is incorrect, as the context requires "Wehrbudget" referring to budget appropriations for defense.	4. "Central Command" is incorrectly translated as "Zentralkommunikations", a term unrelated to the military context. It should remain "Central Command".	5. "found" translating to "fand statt" changes the structure and intent; "berichtet von" correctly conveys the interim report’s finding.	6. "doctoring" is translated as "dokumentiert", which significantly alters the meaning from manipulating information to merely recording them; "veränderten" correctly implies altering or manipulating.
Central Command → Zentralkommando → Central Command  	headquarters → Militärquartier → Hauptquartier  		**Explanation:** "Zentralkommando" does not accurately capture "Central Command" as it changes the proper noun which is normally retained in translations without changes. "Militärquartier" (military quarter) does not fully convey the concept of "headquarters," significantly altering the original meaning.
1. Intelligence → Intelligente → Nachrichtendienstliche  	2. Centcom → Seniorenzentrums → Centcom  	3. leaders → Führern → Kommandeuren  		**Explanation:**  		- **Intelligence → Intelligente → Nachrichtendienstliche:** The word "Intelligence" in this context refers to intelligence information or products related to security and is best translated as "Nachrichtendienstliche". The translation "Intelligente" (intelligent) is incorrect and changes the intended context of intelligence reports.		- **Centcom → Seniorenzentrums → Centcom:** "Centcom" refers to the United States Central Command. The translation "Seniorenzentrums" (senior center) is incorrect and does not convey the intended military context.		- **leaders → Führern → Kommandeuren:** While "Führern" (leaders) is not completely inaccurate, "Kommandeuren" (commanders) is more precise in this military context, aligning better with the intended role of senior Centcom military leaders.
Centcom → Cencom → Centcom  	war fighters → Kriegskämpfer → Soldaten  	Representative → Vertreter → Mitglied des Repräsentantenhauses  	Republican → Republikaner → republikanisches  		**Explanation:**  	1. **Centcom → Cencom → Centcom**: "Cencom" is a mistranslation of "Centcom," which is a specific abbreviation for a military command that should remain unchanged.  	2. **war fighters → Kriegskämpfer → Soldaten**: While "Kriegskämpfer" literally means "war fighters," the reference uses "Soldaten" (soldiers), which is a more standard term aligning with the intended meaning of military personnel.  	3. **Representative → Vertreter → Mitglied des Repräsentantenhauses**: "Vertreter" means "representative," but the more precise translation in the context of U.S. politics is "Mitglied des Repräsentantenhauses" (member of the House of Representatives).  	4. **Republican → Republikaner → republikanisches**: Although "Republikaner" means "Republican," the reference uses "republikanisches," which more accurately reflects the adjectival use in the context of his political affiliation.
Centcom → Cencom → Centcom  	reach → erreichen → reichen  	top → oben → Spitze  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Cencom" is a mistranslation of "Centcom". Although this might be a typographical error, it is essential to maintain correct nomenclature for organizations.	2. "erreichen" (reach) is used instead of "reichen" (as in extend/reach), which changes the meaning slightly but significantly in this context, as it implies physical reaching rather than the extent of influence.	3. "oben" (above/top) is used instead of "Spitze" (peak/top), which does not fully convey the intended meaning of reaching the very top or pinnacle of the organization.
2014 → 2014 → der Jahre 2014  	2015 → 2015 → und 2015  		**Explanation:** The numbers "2014" and "2015" need to reflect the context of "in den Jahren 2014 und 2015" as provided in the reference, indicating a temporal description "in the years 2014 and 2015". The candidate translation lacks the complete expression of the time frame.
(Centcom → Cenzom → Vorgesetzen)  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Cenzom", which does not correspond to the correct reference "Vorgesetzen", which is a contextual equivalent for "Centcom leaders". The mistranslation "Cenzom" does not represent a meaningful entity in either language. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it misrepresents the organization responsible for the pressure, impacting the comprehension of the sentence.
(followed the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules to identify the errors)		Central Command → zentrale → Central Command  	congressional → kongressische → vor dem Kongress  
Centcom → Zentrums → Centcom  	major → schwerer → (omitted or implied)  	assault → Überfall → Rückeroberung  		**Explanation:** "Zentrums" (center) is a mistranslation of "Centcom," which refers to the U.S. Central Command, a specific organization, and should not be generalized as "Zentrums." "Schwerer" (heavy, severe) is used as a modifier for "assault," while "major" ("bedeutend" or similar) is the intended sense, and importantly, the structure used suggests a different meaning. "Überfall" (raid, attack) changes the nature of "assault" intended as "Rückeroberung" (recapture, reoccupation), reflecting significant mistranslations according to **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and aligns well with the reference translation. "Mosul" is spelled slightly differently ("Mossul"), but this is an acceptable variation. The rest of the words accurately represent the source sentence in context, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Representative → Vertreter → Kongressabgeordneter  	clear → deutlich → klar  		**Explanation:** "Vertreter" (representative) is not as specific as "Kongressabgeordneter" (congressman), which loses the specific political context. "deutlich" (clearly) is not as direct as "klar" (clear), which misrepresents the certainty conveyed in the statement.
United States → amerikanischen → Central  	intelligence leaders → Nachrichtenführer → Spitzen  	intelligence products → Geheimdienste → nachrichtendienstlichen Berichte  	threat → Bedrohung → Gefahr  		**Explanation:**  	1. "amerikanischen" (American) is used to translate "United States", but the reference specifically uses "Central" referring to "Central Command" (Central Command's proper name). This is a mismatched translation, making it a significant error.  	2. "Nachrichtenführer" (intelligence leaders) is mistranslated as "Spitzen" (tops/leaders), which is the more accurate word choice given the context described.  	3. "Geheimdienste" (intelligence services/agencies) mistranslates "intelligence products", which should be "nachrichtendienstlichen Berichte" (intelligence reports), indicating specific output rather than agencies.  	4. "Bedrohung" (threat) vs. "Gefahr" (danger): while both can be used interchangeably in some contexts, "Gefahr" aligns better with the context provided in the reference translation regarding the nature of the threat being downplayed.  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference translations. The main elements such as "Republicans," "Taskforce," "analysts," "concerns," and "manipulated" are translated correctly. Additionally, important concepts like "intelligence" and "Islamic State" are contextually accurate, matching the intended message. Despite minor stylistic differences, no significant single-word mistranslations affect the meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both the candidate and reference translations convey the same overall message as the source. Key differences, such as "veröffentlichten" vs "veröffentlichte" (both forms of "released"), are acceptable in this context. The phrases "folgen" and "vervollständigt werden" both suggest a continuation with more findings, fitting the contextual meaning. Thus, no significant single-word translation errors are present.
1. Centcom → Zentcom → Centcom		**Explanation:** "Zentcom" is an incorrect translation of "Centcom". The term "Centcom" is a proper noun referring to the United States Central Command, and should not be translated. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as proper nouns generally remain unchanged in translations, especially when widely recognized. Additionally, no other significant single-word errors change the meaning in context according to the rules provided.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although "Geheimdienstausschuss" and "Nachrichtendienstekomittees" are two different translations, they both refer to a committee related to intelligence services. Additionally, the German word "Taskforce" and "Task Force" both convey the intended meaning. In this context, "zustimmen" (agree) and "übereinstimmen" (match or be in agreement with) both effectively communicate the intended meaning. Therefore, there are no significant single-word translation errors in the candidate translation compared to the reference.
Centcom → Cencom → Centcom  	insular → inselliaren → eingeschränkten  	Schiff → Schaater → Schiff		**Explanation:** "Cencom" is a misspelling of "Centcom", violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it is a specific proper noun. "inselliaren" does not correspond to any known German word and should be "eingeschränkten" to accurately represent "insular", breaching the **Identify Mistranslations** rule. "Schaater" is a mistranslation of "Schiff", another proper noun error under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Schiff → Schawter → Schiff  	release → Freigabe → Veröffentlichung  	hurt → verletzt → schädigte  		**Explanation:**  	- "Schawter" is an incorrect translation of "Schiff," likely due to a misinterpretation or error in name transcription.	- "Freigabe" (release) does not capture the nuance of delay implied by "release" in this context, compared to "Veröffentlichung" (publication) which better matches the source "release."	- "verletzt" (injured) does not adequately capture the non-physical connotation of "hurt" in context, whereas "schädigte" (damaged) is more fitting.
Schiff → Schaator → Schiff  	Centcom → Cencom → Centcom  	narrative → Terminologie → Meinung  		**Explanation:** "Schaator" is a mistranslation of "Schiff," which changes the proper noun incorrectly; thus, it violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule. "Cencom" is a spelling error for "Centcom," which fails the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Terminologie" (terminology) is a mistranslation of "narrative," which distorts the intended meaning in context, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
congressional → kongressiven → des Kongresses  	investigation → Untersuchung → Ermittlungen  		**Explanation:** "kongressiven" is a mistranslation of "congressional". In this context, "des Kongresses" (of the Congress) is more accurate. Also, "Untersuchung" (investigation) is a mistranslation of "Ermittlungen" when referring specifically to a formal investigation like that conducted by a congressional body.
Centcom → Zentcom → Centcom  	investigation → Generaluntersuchung → Ermittlungen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Zentcom" is a mistranslation of "Centcom". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule due to the altered abbreviation.	- "Generaluntersuchung" (general investigation) mistranslates "investigation" where "Ermittlungen" is more contextually accurate for "investigations", aligning with the usage in the reference.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the essential meanings of the source sentence. The differences between "gab in einer Stellungnahme an" and "sagte in einer Erklärung" are stylistic and do not constitute significant changes in meaning. Similarly, "fortgesetzt wird" and "noch im Gange seien" are both valid translations for the continuation of an investigation. All key elements are accurately represented and fit in context, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
experts → Experten → Experten  	intelligence community → Nachrichtengemeinschaft → Nachrichtendienste  	national security → nationalen Sicherheitsthemen → nationalen Verteidigung  		**Explanation:**  	- "experts": Both candidate and reference translations use "Experten," which aligns with the source "experts." Therefore, no error here.		- "intelligence community": "Nachrichtengemeinschaft" is less conventional compared to "Nachrichtendienste," which is more accurate for "intelligence community." This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		- "national security": "nationalen Sicherheitsthemen" diverges from "nationalen Verteidigung," indicating a subtle shift in meaning. The reference suggests a narrower focus on "defense," whereas "Sicherheit" implies broader national security. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
investigation → Untersuchung → Ermittlungen  	Defense → Verteidigungsbeamten → Angehörigen des Verteidigungsministeriums  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Untersuchung" (investigation) is translated as "Ermittlungen" in the reference, which better fits the context of an official or formal inquiry.	2. "Verteidigungsbeamten" (Defense officials) should be "Angehörigen des Verteidigungsministeriums" (members of the Department of Defense) as per the reference to indicate a more formal or specific group within the defense structure.
allegations → Behauptungen → Anschuldigungen		rely → zählen → verlassen		Command → Zentralkommando → Central Command		assessments → Bewertung → Einschätzungen		crisis spots → Krisenherden → Krisenregionen		**Explanation:** 		- "allegations" was inaccurately translated as "Behauptungen" (claims), whereas "Anschuldigungen" (accusations) maintains the serious tone of potential misconduct or wrongdoing.	- "rely" was translated as "zählen" (count), which is less precise than "verlassen" (rely), which better conveys dependence.	- "Command" was mistranslated as "Zentralkommando," which in this context should remain "Central Command," referring to the specific military command.	- "assessments" was mistranslated as "Bewertung" (evaluation), while "Einschätzungen" (assessments) more accurately reflects the analysis and judgment in the context of military operations.	- "crisis spots" was translated as "Krisenherden" (crisis hotspots), but "Krisenregionen" (crisis regions) better captures the wide areas affected by crises in this specific geopolitical context.
1. critiques → Kritiken → Kritik	2. Islamic State intelligence → Nachrichtenübermittlung des islamischen Staates → Geheiminformationen über den Islamischen Staat	3. mirror → wider → erinnern an	4. disputes → Einwänden → Zwistigkeiten	5. a small force → eine kleine Kraft → eine kleine Besatzungstruppe		**Explanation:** 	- "Kritiken" (critiques) should be "Kritik", as the reference translation uses the singular form.	- "Nachrichtenübermittlung des islamischen Staates" (transmission of news of the Islamic state) is a mistranslation for "Islamic State intelligence", which is "Geheiminformationen über den Islamischen Staat".	- "wider" (reflect) does not convey the same meaning as "erinnern an" (resemble/recall), which is required by "mirror disputes".	- "Einwänden" (objections) misrepresents "disputes", which translates to "Zwistigkeiten" (conflicts/disputes).	- "eine kleine Kraft" (a small force) misinterprets the meaning of "a small force" as more military-focused, correctly translated as "eine kleine Besatzungstruppe" (a small occupation force).
intelligence → Geheimdienste → Berichterstattung  	insurrection → Aufständischen → Aufstand  		**Explanation:** "Geheimdienste" (intelligence services) is a mistranslation of "intelligence" in this context, where "Berichterstattung" (reporting) is more appropriate. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it does not fit the meaning related to the "Islamic State intelligence" being discussed. The use of "Aufständischen" (insurgents) instead of "insurrection" also changes the intended meaning, which is about a rebellion or uprising, not individuals ("Aufstand" is the correct term). This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by identifying individual mistranslated words that significantly alter the sentence's meaning.
officials → - → nach Angabe von Regierungsstellen  	Islamic State-held → islamischen Staates → vom Islamischen Staat gehalten  	makeshift → Notrufraffinerien → provisorische  		**Explanation:**  	1. "officials" is entirely omitted in the candidate translation. The reference includes "nach Angabe von Regierungsstellen", which provides crucial context that the information is according to officials' statements.	2. "Islamic State-held" is mistranslated as "islamischen Staates", which doesn't imply possession or control. The reference translation "vom Islamischen Staat gehalten" correctly conveys that the refineries are held by the Islamic State.	3. "makeshift" is mistranslated as "Notrufraffinerien", which incorrectly implies emergency services rather than temporary or improvised solutions. The reference uses "provisorische", which aligns with the source's meaning of makeshift.
distributed → verteilt → veröffentlicht  		**Explanation:** The source word "distributed" is mistranslated as "verteilt" in the candidate sentence, while the reference correctly uses "veröffentlicht" which means "published" or "reported", aligning with the context of the news. This conforms to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as the mistranslation changes the intended action regarding the finding.
Centcom's → von Com → Centcoms  		**Explanation:**  	The candidate translation uses "von Com" instead of the correct "Centcoms" for "Centcom's." The term "Centcom" is a specific name (Central Command of the United States Armed Forces), and thus should remain unchanged in the German translation. The erroneous rendering significantly alters the specificity and proper attribution required, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Austin → Autin → Austin		**Explanation:** "Autin" is a mistranslation of the name "Austin." The incorrect spelling changes the identity of the person mentioned, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Wins → Win → gewinnen  	Straight → Straight → Match  	Showdown → Shown → Showdown  		**Explanation:**  	- "Win" is a repetition error, whereas the context and meaning require "gewinnen" to align with "Wins".	- "Straight" is translated literally rather than contextualized into "Match" (indicating consecutive wins) in the reference.	- "Shown" is likely a misrecognition of "Showdown," indicating a matchup, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
one → Kratte → Einen  	scored → erreicht → schoss  	goals → Ziele → Tore  		**Explanation:**  	- "Kratte" does not exist as a German word and seems to be an error in translation for "One" or "Katie," which should be "Einen Tag" (one day).	- "erreicht" (achieved/reached) is a mistranslation of "scored," which should logically be "schoss" (shot).	- "Ziele" (targets) is a mistranslation in the context of sports, where "Tore" (goals) is the correct term.
goals → Ziele → Tore		**Explanation:** The source word "goals" was mistranslated as "Ziele" (objectives) in the candidate sentence, rather than the correct "Tore" (goals in a sports context), which is the reference translation. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes the intended sports context meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Ich habe keine Ahnung", sagte sie." is semantically equivalent to the reference translation "Ich habe keine Ahnung." sagte sie." The minor punctuation difference does not change the meaning of the sentence, and thus no significant single-word translation error is present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While there are differences between the candidate ("Ziele verfolgen") and the reference translation ("Tore im Gedächtnis behalten"), both convey a similar overall meaning regarding not keeping track of one's goals. The candidate's wording "Ziele verfolgen" translates to "pursuing goals," which in this context remains consistent with the intended meaning. Thus, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, this variation is deemed acceptable.
1. know → weiß → weiß allerdings		**Explanation:** The phrase "Here is what she does know" is intended to convey that "this is what she definitively knows". The candidate's translation "Sie weiß es" doesn't capture the nuance of the original's assertion and emphasis found in the reference's "Das weiß sie allerdings."		2. tournament → Turnus → Wettkampf		**Explanation:** The word "Turnus" implies a regular cycle or rotation, which doesn't carry the specific competitive connotation of "tournament" as "Wettkampf" does. The original refers to a competitive sports context where "Wettkampf" is more appropriate.		3. group → Fraktion → Gruppe		**Explanation:** The candidate's usage of "Fraktion" (which refers more to a faction or parliamentary group) is contextually inaccurate as it doesn't fit the sports context where "Gruppe" (group) is suitable.		4. tied → verbunden → gleichauf		**Explanation:** The candidate uses "verbunden" (connected), which doesn't accurately convey the sports-specific context of being "tied" in standings that "gleichauf" (level or on par) would convey in this context.		5. defeat → Niederlage → Sieg		**Explanation:** The term "Niederlage" (defeat) is incorrect as it indicates Japan defeated Britain, whereas the source indicates Britain's victory. The reference uses "Sieg" (victory), which is the correct translation. The meaning is significantly changed otherwise, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively communicates the same meaning as the source sentence. Both "USA" and "Vereinigten Staaten" (United States) are acceptable translations, and "treffen" is a suitable way to express "will meet." The translation aligns well with the source and reference following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, and no significant mistranslations affect the meaning.
qualified → vierteljährlichen → Viertelfinale	first → fertig → ersten	second → ausläuft → zweiten		**Explanation:** 	1. "vierteljährlichen" (quarterly) is a mistranslation of "quarter finals". The intended meaning of the sports tournament phase is lost, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "fertig" (finished) in the sense of "completed" does not correctly convey "first" in terms of ranking, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	3. "ausläuft" (runs out) is incorrect for "second" in a ranking context, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
first-place → Finaler → Erstplatzierte  	bracket → Karte → Gruppe  	quarter finals → Viertelstunde → Viertelfinale  		**Explanation:**  	- "Finaler" is not a correct translation for "first-place". It significantly changes the meaning, thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Erstplatzierte" accurately reflects "first-place finisher".	- "Karte" translates to "card" or "map", not "bracket", which in this context refers to a tournament format, correctly translated as "Gruppe". This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule due to the change in context: a structural element in competitions.	- "Viertelstunde" means "quarter hour", which is incorrect for "quarter finals". "Viertelfinale" captures the intended sporting event context properly. This mistake falls under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it misrepresents the timing and nature of the event.
stir → Aufruhr → Wirbel  	run → Aufmarsch → Erfolgsgeschichte  		**Explanation:** "Aufruhr" (upheaval) is a mistranslation of "stir", which should be "Wirbel" (commotion, stir) to properly convey the sense of creating interest or excitement. "Aufmarsch" (march) is a mistranslation of "run", which is intended to mean "success" or "achievement" in this context, hence "Erfolgsgeschichte" (success story) is more appropriate. Both of these mistranslations significantly alter the intended meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Bam → Damals → Bam  	on → das → Teil 		**Explanation:** 	1. "Damals" (then) is a mistranslation of "Bam", which is a proper noun and integral to the subject of the sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the name "Bam" has been replaced with an incorrect temporal expression.	2. "das" (the) improperly reflects the prepositional relationship signified by "on" in the source sentence. The reference uses "Teil" (part of), accurately capturing the intended relationship. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
1. grew → ist aufgewachsen → wuchs	2. Blue Bell, Pa. → Blaue Bell, Pa → Blue Bell, Pennsylvania	3. picked → aufgenommen → hatte	4. field hockey stick → Feldhockeystick → Hockeyschläger	5. team → in der Nationalmannschaft → Nationalspielerin	6. player → Akteur → Spielerin		**Explanation:**	1. The candidate's "ist aufgewachsen" ("has grown up") does not match the more simple past "wuchs" ("grew"), maintaining past tense consistency.	2. "Blaue Bell, Pa" is a mistranslation of "Blue Bell, Pennsylvania" as "Blue Bell" is a proper noun, and "Pa." should be expanded to "Pennsylvania."	3. The word "aufgenommen" ("picked up") is not as precise as "hatte" ("had" in hand) to convey picking up for the first time in this context.	4. "Feldhockeystick" ("field hockey stick") is less colloquial than "Hockeyschläger."	5. "in der Nationalmannschaft" ("in the national team") alters the sentence structure diverging from the reference sentence which focuses on becoming part of the team as indicated correctly by "Nationalspielerin."	6. "Akteur" ("actor") is less accurate than "Spielerin" ("player" or "team member"), which reflects gender explicitly in "spieler" context.
missed out → verließ → verpasste  	cut → Kürzung → qualifizieren  	roster → Rast → Kader  		**Explanation:**  	1. "verließ" (left) is a mistranslation of "missed out". This significantly changes the meaning because "verließ" implies departure from something she had already attended, while "verpasste" indicates she did not have the opportunity to participate.	2. "Kürzung" (cut, in the sense of reducing or cutting something) is a mistranslation in the context of qualifying, as "cut" here refers to making the team roster, where "qualifizieren" (qualified) is the intended meaning.	3. "Rast" (rest or pause) does not fit the context of "roster", which refers to a list of participants, whereas "Kader" is the correct term for a team or squad in sports.
nothing → nichts → alles		**Explanation:** "nichts" (nothing) is a mistranslation of "everything" (alles) in the context of "when nothing much went right for her and her teammates." The reference contains "alles schiefging," meaning "everything went wrong," indicating a change of perception from "right" to "wrong," which is crucial to the sentence's meaning. This aligns with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it alters the evaluation of 2012's events.
year → Jahr → darauffolgenden  	coach → Bus → Trainer  		**Explanation:** The word "Jahr" (year) was translated accurately, but the reference used "darauffolgenden" (following) which adds a slight nuance not captured by just "Jahr". However, this is not an error as the core meaning is maintained, so it should not be marked. On the other hand, "Bus" is a clear mistranslation of "coach," where the intended meaning refers to a sports coach rather than a vehicle. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the meaning is significantly altered in context.
cultural → kultureller → Kultur  	mental → psychischer → mentaler  	physical → physischer → körperlicher  		**Explanation:** 		1. "kultureller" is a mistranslation of "cultural". The reference uses "Kulturwechsel", which directly translates to "culture change", whereas "kultureller" means "cultural" without capturing the notion of change as a noun, thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	   	2. "psychischer" is a mistranslation of "mental". While "psychischer" can relate to psychological aspects, the source specifies "mental", which is translated in the reference as "mentaler", fitting the context of change in a more aligned manner with the source, highlighting the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.		3. "physischer" is a mistranslation of "physical". The reference uses "körperlicher", which means "bodily" in context and aligns with the meaning of "physical change" as intended in the source, ensuring **Contextual Accuracy**.
work rate → Arbeitsquote → Arbeitspensum  		**Explanation:** "Arbeitsquote" (work quota) as translated in the candidate sentence significantly alters the intended meaning of "work rate", which refers to the pace or amount of work being done. The correct term in the context of this translation is "Arbeitspensum" (workload), as reflected in the reference sentence. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it changes the interpretation of the subject's productivity.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "eine komplette Wende vollzogen" effectively conveys the meaning of "a complete turnaround". While the expressions in the candidate and reference translations differ ("Wende vollzogen" vs. "Ruder herumreißen"), both capture the intended meaning of making a significant change or reversal. Therefore, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, there is no significant error to report.
scoring → Screening → Torreigen  		**Explanation:** "Screening" is a mistranslation of "scoring". In the context of a sports match, "scoring" refers to the act of making points or goals, not a screening process. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it changes the meaning of the action being described.
tournament → Turnus → Turnier  	score → Spiel → Spielstand  	period → Zeitraum → Viertel  		**Explanation:** "Turnus" (interval or routine) is an incorrect translation of "tournament", which refers to a sporting competition. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Spiel" (game) is used instead of "Spielstand" (score), which is a more precise term for the context. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule. Lastly, "Zeitraum" (time period) is a mistranslation of "period" in the context of the game quarters or segments, which is why "Viertel" (quarter) is the correct term here.
long → lange → Sprint  	run → beschäftigt → (none needed for "run")  	side → Seite → Flanke  	curled → getrickst → zog  	goal → Ziel → Tor  	lead → Spiel → Führung  		**Explanation:** 	1. "lange" doesn't correspond to "long run" but rather translates to "long". The action is not accurately translated as "Sprint", capturing the intended fast movement.	2. "beschäftigt" (engaged) doesn't represent "run" in this context. The phrase was not translated as "run", altering the meaning.	3. "Seite" (side) can be translated more accurately as "Flanke" (flank) in the context of a football field.	4. "getrickst" implies a type of trick play which is not equivalent to "curled" (moved), which should be rendered as "zog".	5. "Ziel" is an incorrect translation for "goal" in football, which is "Tor".	6. "Spiel" (game) mistranslates "lead", which should be "Führung", important in describing the score. The translation also introduced a numerical error, but the focus here is on "Spiel" versus "lead".
final → Endziel → finale  	goal → Endziel → Tor  	period → Periode → Viertels  		**Explanation:** 	- "Endziel" (end goal) is incorrect for "final" and "goal". "Finale" better captures the context of the final element in a game, and "Tor" (goal) is the correct translation when referring to sports contexts.	- "Periode" is a mistranslation for "period" in this specific context. Based on the reference, the appropriate term should be "Viertels" (quarter), as it refers to sports periods being quarters. This change maintains the idea of sports periods being referred to as quarters, as indicated in the reference translation.
goalie → Galia → Torhüterin  	goal → Ziel → Tor  		**Explanation:** "Galia" is not a correct translation of "goalie", which should be "Torhüterin". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Galia" has no related meaning to "goalie". Also, "Ziel" (target) is a mistranslation of "goal", which should be "Tor" in the context of sports, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it changes the context of the game.
on a roll → auf einer Rednerliste → einen Lauf  		**Explanation:** "auf einer Rednerliste" translates to "on a speaker's list", which is a literal mistranslation of the idiomatic expression "on a roll". The correct German idiom is "einen Lauf haben", which captures the intended meaning of being in a successful period, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In this context, while "So is Bam" is somewhat informal and open to interpretation, both "Das ist auch Bam" and "Genauso wie Bam" capture the comparative aspect implied by "so is". The candidate translation remains faithful to this interpretation, thus fitting the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, and no clear mistranslation or significant change in meaning is observed.
place → Ort → Position		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Ort" for "place," which is a literal translation. However, in this context, "Position" as in the reference translation better captures the intended metaphorical meaning of the English expression "a good place." This is an example of the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, where the literal translation does not match the metaphorical intent.
fury → Vorys → Rage  	trampoline → Trampoline → Trampolins  		**Explanation:** "Vorys" is a mistranslation of "fury." It doesn't accurately convey the intended meaning, which should be "Rage" in this context. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as the incorrect word alters the sense of agitation suggested by "fury." "Trampoline" in the candidate sentence is plural, whereas the reference uses the singular form "Trampolins." This is a significant deviation that affects the meaning, as per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation correctly captures the meaning of the source sentence. Although there are differences in phrasing with the reference translation, such as "egal in welcher Zeit" versus "wie spät es auch ist," both convey the intended meaning about time and presence. There are no significant single-word errors that alter the central message, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
events → Ereignisse → Veranstaltungen  	furious → wütend → rasender  		**Explanation:** "Ereignisse" (events) is a broader term than "Veranstaltungen" (specific events, usually organized or formal, such as competitions), which changes the interpretation in this sports context. "Wütend" (angry) is a mistranslation of "furious," which in this context refers to speed and intensity rather than anger, making "rasender" (raging/racing) a more accurate choice.
archer → Erzauber → Armbrustschützen  	baton → Flammenschlag → Stab  	gymnast → (missing) → Turner  		**Explanation:**  	- "Erzauber" (not a correct translation and contextually incorrect) is a mistranslation of "archer" and should be "Armbrustschützen" (crossbow shooter) based on context.  	- "Flammenschlag" (flaming blow) is a mistranslation of "baton" which should be "Stab" (stick/rod) as "brennender Stab" (burning stick/rod) is a fitting metaphor for the Olympic torch.	- There is a missing translation for "gymnast" in the candidate translation, which should be "Turner" as in the reference translation.
television → Fernsehen → Fernseher  	turn on → abwechseln → einschalten  	Katie Ledecky → Klatte Ledecy → Katie Ledecky  	feud → Feud → Streit  	Michael Phelps → Michael Phils → Michael Phelps  	Chad → Tschad → Chad  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The phrase "ist da noch" in the candidate translation conveys the same meaning as "gibt es noch" in the reference translation, keeping the sense intact. Hence, no significant mistranslations are present. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as both versions correctly express the intended meaning.
first-time → erstmals → zum ersten Mal  	dimpled → zerfallener → mit Grübchen  	heartthrob → Herzblut → Frauenschwarm  	household → Haushaltsnamen → bekannten  	showcased → unter Beweis gestellt → gesendet  	buoyed → gekauft → aufgebaut  	feel-good → fühlsreichen → Wohlfühl  	commercials → Fernsehkommerzialen → TV-Werbung  	gymnast → Gymnast → Turner  	fencer → Zenter → Fechter  		**Explanation:**  	1. "erstmals" (first-time) does not correctly capture "zum ersten Mal" (first-time) in this context where "Olympian" is absent.	2. "zerfallener" (dimpled) is a mistranslation of "mit Grübchen" (dimpled), mistakenly suggesting decay rather than a physical characteristic.	3. "Herzblut" (heartthrob) does not convey "Frauenschwarm" (heartthrob/dreamboat), as "Herzblut" means blood/heartblood.	4. "Haushaltsnamen" (household names) implies literal domestic names rather than "bekannten" (known/well-known) names.	5. "unter Beweis gestellt" (showcased) translated as "gesendet" (broadcasted/shown) refers incorrectly to proving rather than airing on TV.	6. "gekauft" (buoyed) meaning purchased, instead of "aufgebaut" (supported/raised), changes the context.	7. "fühlsreichen" (feel-good) inaccurately suggests full of feelings instead of the specific "Wohlfühl" (feel-good) TV tone.	8. "Fernsehkommerzialen" (commercials) needs to be simply "TV-Werbung" (TV ads), where "kommerzialen" adds no clear meaning.	9. "Gymnast" (gymnast) in this context should be "Turner," a specialized term for the Olympic athlete.	10. "Zenter" (fencer) misrepresents "Fechter," which is the appropriate word for the sport.
Lake Forest → Bodensee → Lake Forest  	competing → konkurriert → kämpft  	trampoline → Trampoline → Trampolinturnen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Bodensee" (Lake Constance) is a mistranslation of "Lake Forest", as it refers to an entirely different geographical location.	2. "konkurriert" (competes) is a mistranslation of "competing" in the context of this sentence. The reference suggests a more apt word is "kämpft" (fights), capturing the sports context better.	3. "Trampoline" refers to the equipment, while "Trampolinturnen" refers to the sport of trampoline gymnastics, which is the correct interpretation needed here according to the reference.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation matches the reference translation exactly. The phrase "each event equally" is correctly translated as "jedes Ereignis gleich", and there are no discrepancies in the translation of other words. This follows the **No translation errors detected** rule, as there are no mistranslations present.
air-pistol → Flugpistoilschuss → Luftpistolenschießen  	archery → Kirchenschuhe → Bogenschießen  		**Explanation:** "Flugpistoilschuss" is a mistranslation of "air-pistol shooting". The correct translation is "Luftpistolenschießen". "Kirchenschuhe" (church shoes) is completely unrelated to "archery", which should be "Bogenschießen". These errors significantly change the meaning of the sentence and thus must be corrected.
breaststroke → Bruststreik → Brustschwimmen  		**Explanation:** "Bruststreik" (breast strike) is a mistranslation of "breaststroke". The intended meaning is the swimming style "breaststroke", which is accurately translated as "Brustschwimmen". This error significantly changes the meaning, violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
case → Argument → Argumente  	favorite → Liebhaber → Liebling  	trampoline → Trampoline → Trampolins  		**Explanation:** 	- "Argument" is not an accurate translation of "case" in this context, where it refers to making a point rather than presenting a formal argument.	- "Liebhaber" means "lover" rather than "favorite" in the intended sense of a preferred thing or choice.	- "Trampoline" is plural in the candidate translation, while the source and reference indicate it should be singular, "Trampolins."
intervening → letzten → intervening  	Trampoline → Trampolinspringen → Trampolinspringen  	realize → wussten → bewusst  		**Explanation:** The word "intervening" is mistranslated as "16 Jahren" (16 years), but the reference uses "letzten" (last), which is more appropriate in context. In German, "Trampolinspringen" (trampoline jumping) rather than "Trampoline" should be used to correctly specify the sport. The candidate uses "bewusst waren" (were aware), while "wussten" (knew) as in the reference is more contextually fitting for "realize".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words "mag" (may), "regionale" (regional), and "Ignoranz" (ignorance) are correctly translated and do not significantly deviate from the reference translation. The slight difference in nuance between "mag" (may) and "könnte auch" (could also) does not warrant labeling either as incorrect given the focus on meaningful changes.
United States → USA → USA  	trampoline → Trampoline → Trampolinspringen  	advance → Athletenvorstoß → einen Athleten gehabt, der es bis zur Endrunde geschafft hat  		**Explanation:** 		- **"United States" → "USA"**: "USA" is the correct abbreviation in both German and English, so there is no error here. 		- **"trampoline" → "Trampoline"**: The candidate translates "trampoline" literally, which misses the specific context of "trampolinspringen" (trampoline gymnastics/sport), altering the intended meaning. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. 		- **"advance" → "Athletenvorstoß"**: This part is not coherent in German and doesn't convey the intended meaning of "having an athlete progress to the finals." The correct idea is "einen Athleten gehabt, der es bis zur Endrunde geschafft hat," focusing on the progression specific to the context, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, and all key elements, such as "split the prizes" and the involved countries, are correctly represented in the context given. The difference between "aufzuteilen" (to allocate) and "zu teilen" (to share) does not significantly change the meaning. Therefore, this falls under acceptable variations as per the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, with no significant mistranslations present.
Rosie → Roe → Rosie  	aus → von → aus  		**Explanation:** "Roe" is a mistranslation of "Rosie". This error significantly changes the identification of the person. "von" (from) is an incorrect preposition in this context, as "aus" (from) is the appropriate translation for indicating origin or nationality in German.
1. underdog → Unterhundecharm → Außenseitercharme  	2. trampoline → trampolinen → Trampolinspringen  	3. clown college → Klonkollegium → Clownsschule  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Unterhundecharm" is a mistranslation of "underdog charm." The correct translation is "Außenseitercharme" as it captures the intended meaning of something that is underestimated yet appealing.  	2. "trampolinen" as a verb form doesn't fit the context of "trampoline" as a noun and activity. "Trampolinspringen" is appropriate here.  	3. "Klonkollegium" (clone college) is a clear mistranslation of "clown college," which should be "Clownsschule" to maintain the intended humorous tone in context.
confess → gestehen → zugeben  	earthbound → Verfechter → erdgebundener  		**Explanation:** "gestehen" (to confess in a formal or literal sense) is a mistranslation of "zugeben" (to admit), which more accurately conveys casual self-deprecation in this context. "Verfechter" (advocate) is a mistranslation of "erdgebundener" (earthbound), which refers to being grounded or limited, impacting the intended meaning.
comic → kommunales → humoristisches  	quaver → Karikatura → Zittern  	bounce → Zustands → Aufpralls  	gymnastics → Gymnasmus → Turnens  	diving → Tauben → Tauchens  	sports → Sporte → Sportarten  		**Explanation:** 	- "kommunales" (communal) is a mistranslation of "comic" (related to humor), violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as the meaning shifts from humor to community-related.	- "Karikatura" (caricature) is incorrect in this context. "quaver" is intended to describe vibrations or tremors, and "Zittern" (trembling) matches this meaning more closely, ensuring **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.	- "Zustands" (condition) is incorrect for "bounce", which indicates a motion or impact, making "Aufpralls" (impact) more suitable, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "Gymnasmus" (a non-existent word) is incorrect for "gymnastics", and "Turnens" (gymnastics) aligns with the intended meaning.	- "Tauben" (pigeons) is a mistranslation of "diving", significantly altering the meaning from a sport to a bird, thus changing the context entirely.	- "Sporte" (direct and mistaken transliteration of 'sports') is not fitting in the context, where "Sportarten" (types of sports) correctly conveys the intended meaning, maintaining the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.
trampoline → trampoline → Trampolin  	Tampolín → El-Tampolín → El Trampolin  	Ding → Ding → Sprung  	board → board → Brett  		**Explanation:** 	- "trampoline" should be capitalized as "Trampolin" in German, following proper noun rules and consistent with the translation of the word.	- "El-Tampolín" is incorrect as the correct Spanish origin should be "El Trampolin" without the hyphen and with a lowercase "t" in "Trampolin".	- "Ding" (thing) is a mistranslation of "diving", a key part of "diving board." The reference sentence uses "Sprungbrett," with "Sprung" (jump) appropriately reflecting "diving" in the context of a board used for jumping into water.	- "board" is translated correctly in the reference sentence as "Brett," corresponding to "Sprungbrett."
aspiring → anstrebende → aufstrebende  	trampoline → Riesentrampoline → gigantischen Trampolin  	feet → Beine → Fuß  	moves → Schritten → Bewegungen  	twists → Twischen → Drehen  	pikes → Rosinen → Hechten  	somersaults → Serusalts → Saltos  		**Explanation:**  	- "anstrebende" (striving) is a close but slightly incorrect translation of "aspiring" in this context, which matches better with "aufstrebende" (up-and-coming).  	- "Riesentrampoline" (giant trampolines) should be singular "gigantischen Trampolin", as in the source and reference.  	- "Beine" (legs) is a mistranslation of "feet", which should be "Fuß" (singular) due to the context.	- "Schritten" (steps) should be "Bewegungen" (moves) since the context involves actions like tumbling.  	- "Twischen" is not a valid translation, presumably intending "twists", which should be "Drehen".  	- "Rosinen" (raisins) is a clear mistranslation, intending "pikes", should be "Hechten".  	- "Serusalts" does not convey "somersaults" correctly, which should be "Saltos".  	Each of these errors follows the **Identify Mistranslations** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, as they significantly change the sentence meaning.
execution → Hinrichtung → Ausführung		**Explanation:** "Hinrichtung" means "execution" in the sense of capital punishment, which dramatically changes the meaning in the context of Olympic program evaluation. The correct word should be "Ausführung," referring to the execution of a performance. However, "Flugzeit" is correctly translated, so it is not listed as an error.
thirty-two → 32 → Zweiundreißig  	athletes → Sportler → Athleten  	compete → konkurrieren → gegeneinander antreten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "32" is a numerical representation but "Zweiundreißig" is explicitly written, maintaining consistency with style in the translation. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Sportler" is a general term for 'sports people', whereas "Athleten" specifically translates to 'athletes', aligning more accurately with the source. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule due to a notable precision drop.	3. "konkurrieren" (to compete) is vague in terms of context compared to "gegeneinander antreten" (compete against each other), which denotes direct competition, applicable here as per the source context "compete".
most common → gemeinsamste → häufigste  	straight → unmittelbar → geradeaus  		**Explanation:** "Gemeinsamste" (most joint) is a mistranslation of "most common," which should be "häufigste," significantly altering the intended meaning. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "Unmittelbar" (immediately) is a mistranslation of "straight," which should be "geradeaus," signifying direction and violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
court → Gericht → Spielplatz		**Explanation:** "Gericht" (court, in the sense of a legal court) is a mistranslation of "court" in the context of a sports playing area, which is better reflected by "Spielplatz" (playing field or playground) in the reference translation. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Gericht" does not fit the intended athletic meaning.
finish line → Trennlinie → Ziellinie  	televised → Fernsehen → Fernsehübertragung  	record → Spuren → Rekords  		**Explanation:**  	- "Trennlinie" (separation line) is a mistranslation of "finish line," significantly altering the sentence's meaning. The significant part of "Trennlinie" as an incorrect translation is captured by "finish line" translating explicitly to "Ziellinie."  	- "Fernsehen" (television) doesn't encapsulate the sense of "televised coverage," which is more accurately "Fernsehübertragung." This maintains the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.  	- "Spuren" (tracks) does not correctly convey the intended meaning of "record" in this context, which should be "Rekords." This change aligns with the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
single-minded → zielstrebige → zielgerichtete  	fanatic → phantastisch → fanatisch  		**Explanation:** "zielstrebige" (determined) is a less accurate translation of "single-minded" compared to "zielgerichtete" (single-minded), which fits the context of the pursuit being driven by a single focus. "phantastisch" (fantastic) is a mistranslation of "fanatic," which conveys an entirely different meaning. "Fanatisch" accurately retains the intensity of the original term.
slightly → erstaunlich → ermüdend  		**Explanation:** "erstaunlich" (amazing) is a mistranslation of "slightly exhausting", which changes the intended sentiment of finding the games mildly tiring into finding them amazing. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it alters the exhaustion sentiment conveyed by the source.
trampoline → Ratempo → Trampolin  		**Explanation:** "Ratempo" is an incorrect translation for "trampoline". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Ratempo" is not a recognizable word in this context and changes the intended meaning of the sentence.
trampoliner's → Trampoliner-Vektor → Trampolinspringers		**Explanation:** "Trampoliner-Vektor" incorrectly combines "trampoliner" and "vector," altering the meaning. The correct representation of "trampoliner's" in the context is "Trampolinspringers," which maintains the intended possessor relationship. This error violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "hoch" and "oben" both correctly translate "up" in this context, so no error is reported for that part.
forward → Fortschritte → Vorwärtsbewegung  		**Explanation:** "Fortschritte" (progress) is a mistranslation of "forward motion", as it changes the intended meaning of the sentence. The context emphasizes a literal forward movement rather than progress in a more abstract sense, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
rebound → eingeschränkt → prallt ab  	weightless → erscheinen → schwerelos  	up → aufgestiegen → oben  	effortlessly → mühlos → mühelos  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Eingeschränkt" (restricted) is a mistranslation of "rebound", which incorrectly conveys a sense of limitation rather than the action of bouncing.	2. "Erscheinen" (appear) is used for "weightless as an astronaut". The correct term "schwerelos" retains the intended meaning of lacking weight.	3. "Aufgestiegen" (ascended) changes the meaning of "up" in the context of action direction rather than ascending.	4. "Mühlos" (incorrect spelling of "effortlessly") should be "mühelos", the correct spelling of "effortlessly".
competition → Wettbewerb → Wettbewerb  	charge → Gebühren → Angriff  	frantic → verbalen → hektischen  	vaulting → Abweichen → Wölben  	dreamy → träumen → träumerische  	graceful → einschneidenden → elegante  	gravity → Schwerlastaussetzungen → Schwerkraft  		**Explanation:**  	1. **charge → Gebühren:** "Gebühren" (fees) is a mistranslation of "charge" in the context of a "frantic charge" (attack), which should be translated as "Angriff". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "fees" does not convey the sense of movement or attack.  	2. **frantic → verbalen:** "verbalen" (verbal) is a mistranslation of "frantic", which should be "hektischen". This changes the intended emotional tone.  	3. **vaulting → Abweichen:** "Abweichen" (deviating) does not accurately translate "vaulting" in the context of "vaulting into the distance", which implies a leap or sudden movement and should be "Wölben".  	4. **dreamy → träumen:** "träumen" (dream) is used incorrectly as an adjective instead of the correct form "träumerische" (dreamy).  	5. **graceful → einschneidenden:** "einschneidenden" (incisive) does not match the meaning of "graceful", which should be "elegante".  	6. **gravity → Schwerlastaussetzungen:** "Schwerlastaussetzungen" (heavy load suspension) is incorrect for "gravity", which should be "Schwerkraft".  		As "competition" is correctly translated in both the candidate and reference sentences, it is not flagged as an error.
close → nahe → Zen  		**Explanation:** "nahe" (close) in the candidate translation is translated from "close" in the source but alters the syntax and meaning, impacting the comparison being made, since the candidate sentence structure itself doesn't maintain the intended contextual comparison properly. Therefore, "nahe" is a mistranslation when considering how the intended meaning from the source aligns more closely with "as Zen as."
women's → Frauen → der Frauen  		**Explanation:** The candidate uses "Frauen" (women) in an odd position and with an incorrect article, suggesting the final event itself is female, rather than indicating possession. The reference correctly uses "der Frauen" to indicate the qualifiers and finals for women, maintaining the intended meaning in context.
NBC → BBC → NBC  	air → fliegen → ausstrahlen  	finals → Finale → Endrunden  		**Explanation:**  	- "BBC" is a mistranslation of "NBC". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** as it changes the broadcasting organization.  	- "fliegen" (fly) is a mistranslation of "air" in the broadcasting context. This violates **Focus on Single-Word Errors** since "ausstrahlen" (broadcast) is the correct term here.  	- "Finale" (a singular final) is a mistranslation of "finals" which refers to multiple events, better translated as "Endrunden". This follows **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** as it changes the scope and singular/plural implication.
Mania → Manias → Manie  	melee → Allgemeinen → Tumult  		**Explanation:** "Manias" is an incorrect form and context for the singular "Mania" (referring to the collective excitement for the Olympics), which should be translated as "Manie". "Allgemeinen" (general) is a less specific translation for "melee", where "Tumult" (commotion) more accurately aligns with the chaotic context implied by "melee".
consciousness → Bewusstsein → Bewusstseinssteigerung  	ogling → Gefecht → Angaffen  	objectification → Obdachlosigkeit → Objektifizierung  	proposed → nach → vorschlugen  	fan base → Fassade → Fangemeinde  		**Explanation:**  	- "Bewusstsein" (awareness) does not convey the notion of consciousness "raising" or "enhancement" (Bewusstseinssteigerung), violating the **Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Gefecht" (fight/engagement) is a mistranslation of "ogling," which fundamentally alters the intended meaning, violating the **Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Obdachlosigkeit" (homelessness) is a clear mistranslation of "objectification", violating both the **Meaningful Errors** and **Contextual Accuracy** rules.	- "Nach" (after) fails entirely as a translation for "proposed," which requires "vorschlugen" (proposed/suggested), inappropriately changing the sentence's grammatical sense.	- "Fassade" (facade) instead of "Fangemeinde" (fan base) misrepresents the intended meaning of Mr. Dooley's anticipated audience, which equates to a translation error under **Contextual Accuracy**.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The translation of the sentence is largely correct. The word "long" is not translated in either the candidate or the reference translation, thus aligning both of them. The other words maintain the intended meaning and fit the context in the candidate translation. Therefore, no single-word errors that significantly change the sentence's meaning are present, adhering to the **Strict Adherence Required** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
Violent → Gewaltproteste → Gewalttätige  		**Explanation:** "Gewaltproteste" (violence protests) does not capture the intended meaning of "violent" as an adjective describing the nature of the protests. "Gewalttätige" is the correct translation for "violent" in this context and should be used to describe "Proteste". This is a clear violation of the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because the candidate translation changes the focus from the nature of the protests to the type of protests.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the intended meaning accurately. While there is a slight variation between "political change" (politischen Wandel) and the reference "politische Veränderungen," both convey the same overall meaning. Similarly, "heftigen" (severe) and "gewalttätigen" (violent) describe the nature of the resistance consistently in this context. Both variations are acceptable and the meaning remains intact, satisfying the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. Words such as "Dutzende" (scores) and "Protestierende" (protesters) align well with their corresponding words in the source sentence. While there are variations in expression, such as "tödlich erschossen" and "bei Schusswechseln getötet", these do not introduce any significant change in meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
crack → bröckeln → zusammenzubrechen  		**Explanation:** The word "bröckeln" (crumble) is a mistranslation of "crack" in this context that implies a metaphorical breakdown or collapse, which is accurately captured by "zusammenzubrechen" (to break down/to collapse) in the reference translation. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the intended meaning regarding the situation in Ethiopia.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although the phrases "Im vergangenen Jahrzehnt" and "In den letzten zehn Jahren" differ, they both mean "for the last decade" in this context, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Similarly, "westlicher" and "des Westens" both refer to "Western," maintaining the intended meaning. Therefore, no significant translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the source sentence and matches the intended meaning in the reference translation. While there are slight variations in wording, such as "regierungsfeindliche Proteste" vs. "Proteste gegen die Regierung" and "Bereiche" vs. "Gebiete", they do not change the overall meaning. Thus, per the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, no significant translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While there are some differences between the candidate and reference translations, they do not signify meaningful errors according to the criteria. "Menschen" and "Leute" are acceptable variations for "people," "Straße" and "Straßen" both contextually mean "streets," and "forderten" and "verlangten" both convey the act of demanding, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Additionally, the differences in adjectives such as "einen grundlegenden politischen Wandel" and "fundamentale politische Veränderungen" don't change the meaning enough to be considered significant translation errors.
government → Regierung → Regierung (Correct)	response → Reaktion → Antwort		**Explanation:** "Reaktion" (reaction) is a mistranslation of "response," which in this context should be "Antwort." Though both "Reaktion" and "Antwort" can mean "response," "Antwort" more accurately aligns with the meaning of "response" as used in this context. This addresses the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule for precise language use, as "Antwort" is the correct term in the reference sentence. No other significant single-word translation errors are detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The phrases used for "said" ("sagten") and "scores" ("Dutzende") are acceptable translations in this context. Therefore, no significant single-word translation errors are detected.
officers → Sicherheitsbeamte → Sicherheitsleute  	whipping → stopfen → schlagen  	handstands → Handzeichen → Handstand  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Sicherheitsbeamte" translates to "security officers," but in the reference, "Sicherheitsleute" is used, which is a better contextual fit for "security officers" in this scenario.  	2. "stopfen" (stuff) is a mistranslation of "whipping." This significantly alters the nature of the action being described. "Schlagen" (beat/whip) would be correct.   	3. "Handzeichen" (hand signals) is a mistranslation of "handstands," which changes the physical act performed in the description. "Handstand" (handstand) should be used instead.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation successfully captures the essence of the source sentence while using words that are contextually appropriate. "höchste Menschenrechtsbeamte der Vereinten Nationen" is a valid translation of "top United Nations human rights official," and "fordert nun eine gründliche Untersuchung" correctly translates to "is now calling for a thorough investigation." Any variations between the candidate and reference are acceptable as they do not change the meaning or violate the guidelines.
moving forward → Fortschritte zu machen → zukünftig  	director → Projektdirektor → Projektleiter  	Horn of Africa → Projekt Horn von Afrika → Horn von Afrika  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Fortschritte zu machen" (making progress) mistranslates "moving forward," which in this context refers to future challenges. The reference translation uses "zukünftig," meaning "in the future," which aligns with the intended meaning. Thus, this violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by altering the temporal aspect.	2. "Projektdirektor" (project director) is a less accurate translation for "director" when compared to "Projektleiter" (project leader), which is used in the reference and fits better in the context. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule since "Projektleiter" is the more precise term.	3. "Projekt Horn von Afrika" (Project Horn of Africa) is incorrect as the reference translation shows that it should simply be "Horn von Afrika," referring to a geographical region, and adding "Projekt" misconstrues the meaning. This again follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by isolating "Projekt" as the erroneous addition.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:**  	- "second most populous nation" is correctly translated as "zweitbevölkerungsreichste Nation".  	- "after Nigeria" is accurately rendered as "nach Nigeria".  	- "its stability is cherished by the West" is conveyed as "seine Stabilität wird vom Westen geschätzt", which maintains the intended meaning.  		Despite minor structural differences, the essential elements and meaning align with the source and reference sentences, complying with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the reference translation in meaning. While there are some structural differences, these do not create any significant mistranslations at the word level in comparison to the source sentence. The translation ensures that the intent and specific elements of the original sentence, such as the actors (American military and intelligence services), actions (work closely with Ethiopians), and focus (terrorist threats, especially Somalia, and Western aid), are accurately conveyed in German. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, resulting in no reportable single-word translation errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence "Die Wirtschaft Äthiopiens hat sich beeindruckend entwickelt" translates to "Ethiopia's economy has developed impressively," which retains the core meaning and intent of the source sentence. Although "entwickelt" (developed) is used instead of "expandierte" (expanded), this is an acceptable variation as it does not significantly change the overall meaning. Additionally, the phrase "im beeindruckenden Tempo" (at an impressive clip) is effectively conveyed through "beeindruckend," keeping the intended meaning intact. Thus, no single-word translation errors are present according to the instructions provided.
its → Ihre → Seine  		**Explanation:** "Ihre" is a mistranslation of "its". In this context, "its" is correctly translated as "Seine", reflecting the possessive form related to a neutral noun (infrastructure/infrastruktur in German) with no indication that "Ihre" is applicable here. This error violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** 	The candidate translation, "Und ihre Straßen sind typisch ruhig, sicher und sauber," aligns well with the source sentence, "And its streets are typically quiet, safe and clean." Although the reference uses "in der Regel" for "typically," "typisch" is also an acceptable translation for "typically" in context. Both translations convey the intended meaning accurately, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, no significant translation errors are detected that change the meaning of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with the reference translation, with both adequately preserving the meaning of the source sentence. The words and phrases, such as "Paradebeispiel" for "paragon," "Repression" for "repressiveness," and "zum Schweigen gebracht" for "silenced," fit the intended contextual meanings. There are no significant single-word errors that alter the overall message of the sentence.
exiled → gejagt → ins Exil  	jailed → inhaftiert → ins Gefängnis  	reaches → entfernte → Weiten  		**Explanation:** "gejagt" (hunted) is incorrect for "exiled", which is more about being sent away (ins Exil) rather than pursued. "inhatiert" (imprisoned) is a valid translation in context, but given the reference uses "ins Gefängnis geschickt" (sent to prison), "ins Gefängnis" would more closely match the nuance of "jailed". "entfernte" (distant) does not capture the full extent of "reaches", which "Weiten" (expanses) better translates in the context of a desert.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Aber" and "kann", while the reference uses "Doch" and "könnte". "Aber" and "Doch" can both translate to "but" in different contexts, and "kann" means "can", which is close in meaning to "könnte" (could). The meaning remains mostly intact, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules. No significant change in meaning is detected, so no errors are reported.
suffocate → erstickt → unterdrücken		**Explanation:** "erstickt" (suffocated) is a mistranslation of "underdrücken" (oppress). The context refers to metaphorically limiting people's freedoms or options, making "unterdrücken" the correct reference word. The discrepancy significantly alters the intended meaning, thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:**  	- **"land use" → "Landnutzung":** "Landnutzung" is a valid translation for "land use," capturing the intended meaning.	- **"governing coalition's stranglehold on power" → "Machtstrang der Regierungskoalition":** Although "Machtstrang" doesn't match exactly with "Würgegriff in Bezug auf Macht," it conveys a similar meaning regarding a firm hold or control over power by the coalition. Therefore, it maintains the intended meaning and follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.	- **Other words and phrases** in the candidate translation effectively capture the meaning of the source sentence when considered in context. 		No words in the candidate translation significantly change the meaning compared to the reference translation.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation is accurate and retains the intended meaning of the source sentence. Words such as "bekamen" for "got," "Regierungspartei" for "governing party," and "100%" for "100 percent" are contextually appropriate and do not alter the sentence's meaning, satisfying all the rules outlined in the task.
jagged → gefesselten → zackige  		**Explanation:** "gefesselten" (bound) is a mistranslation of "jagged". This significantly changes the description of the "disputed line", which should refer to its irregular or uneven nature, not being "bound". This adheres to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
vanquished → verschwunden → bezwungen		**Explanation:** "verschwunden" (disappeared) mistranslates "vanquished" (defeated), which changes the intended meaning in context. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as the implications of these words are significantly different regarding the state of the separatist groups.
several → verschiedene → mehrere  	simmering → Geschwafel → vor sich Hinköchelns  		**Explanation:** "Verschiedene" (various) is a mistranslation of "several", which should be "mehrere" as it accurately fits the context. "Geschwafel" (nonsense) is a mistranslation of "simmering", which should be "vor sich Hinköchelns" to reflect the intended meaning of slowly developing or festering. Both errors violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by altering the sentence's intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Die erste ist scheinbar harmlos," which closely aligns with "Der erste scheint harmlos" from the reference. The use of "scheinbar" (seemingly) and "harmlos" (innocuous) convey the intended meaning accurately. Even though there is a gender difference in "Die" vs. "Der," it doesn't significantly alter the overall intended meaning of the sentence. According to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, these minor variations do not constitute significant errors.
Ethiopians → Äthiopier → Äthiopier (correct word)	common → gemeinhin → häufiger		**Explanation:** 	1. "gemeinhin" (generally) is a mistranslation of "common". The context requires "häufiger" (more frequent) to convey the increase in smartphone availability, aligning with the reference translation provided.
shuts down → versperrt → sperrt  	proxies → Stellvertreter → Proxies  	mask → wo → verbergen  		**Explanation:** "versperrt" (block) is a mistranslation of "sperrt" (shut down), changing the level of action implied on access. "Stellvertreter" (representatives) does not fit the context to mean "proxies," which should retain the English term for technical accuracy. "wo" (where) is used incorrectly for "mask" (verbergen), which indicates covering or concealing in the context of internet proxies.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the reference translation with acceptable variations. The phrases "sagten, dass sie sich zu Protesten versammelt hätten" and "gaben an, dass sie sich so zu Protesten versammelten" are both valid ways to represent the source sentence's meaning and context, thus adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Oromos → Oromos → den Oromos   	Aharas → Aharas → Amharas  		**Explanation:** "Oromos" in the candidate sentence lacks the necessary definite article "den" found in the reference translation, making it contextually inaccurate. "Aharas" is clearly a mistranslation of "Amharas", as it is missing the initial letter, significantly altering the name of the ethnic group. These errors follow the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
allies → Verbündeten → Feinde  		**Explanation:** "Verbündeten" (allies) is a mistranslation of "enemies" in the reference translation. Since "allies" and "enemies" are opposites and the reference suggests "Feinde" (enemies), this changes the intended meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
eons → keine Übersetzung → Äonen  	flourished → florierte → prosperierten  	lowland → Niederlandgebieten → Flachlandgebieten  		**Explanation:**  	- "eons" is not directly translated in the candidate sentence; it corresponds to "Äonen" in the reference, which signifies the same substantial time span, marking a significant omission.	- "flourished" is translated as "florierte" instead of "prosperierten". While "florierte" is related, "prosperierten" better captures the economic and political connotation in this context.	- "lowland" is mistranslated as "Niederlandgebieten", which suggests a different geographical area, whereas "Flachlandgebieten" accurately captures the topographical meaning of "lowland" as intended in the context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Aber auch das ändert sich." is a close match to the reference translation "Aber auch das ändert sich gerade." The word "gerade" (just) adds a sense of immediacy, but its absence in the candidate does not significantly change the meaning. Therefore, there are no significant single-word translation errors, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
(umbrella → Dach → Schirm)  		**Explanation:** The word "Dach" (roof) is a mistranslation of "umbrella". While "Dach" and "Schirm" can be metaphorically similar, "Schirm" is the more accurate translation in this context when referring to coordination under an "umbrella". This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "umbrella" conveys a more specific idea in this idiomatic expression.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the intended meaning accurately. While "gab es" and "fanden statt" have different nuances in how the events are expressed, they both correctly represent that the protests occurred. Additionally, the omission of "areas" in the candidate translation doesn't significantly alter the meaning in this context. The **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule supports this evaluation.
Amharas → Aharas → Amharas  	Tigrayan → tigarischen → Tigray  		**Explanation:** "Aharas" is a mistranslation of "Amharas". This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it gives an incorrect name for an ethnic group. "tigarischen" is a mistranslation of "Tigrayan", again altering the name of an ethnic group, which is a critical aspect of the sentence's meaning.
loss → Verlust → Tod  		**Explanation:** "Verlust" (loss) is a mistranslation of "Tod" (death) when referring to someone who has passed away, as in the context of Meles Zenawi. This change in meaning is significant and is addressed under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the key elements and meaning of the source sentence. The translation of "former rebel leader" to "ehemaliger Rebellenführer" is accurate, as well as the translation of "undisclosed illness" to "unoffenkundigen Krankheit." Although there are slight variations in phrasing compared to the reference ("Ministerpräsident" vs. "Premierminister"), these differences do not constitute meaningful errors as they convey the same position accurately. Following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, no significant mistranslations are detected.
considered → galt → angesehen	genius → Genius → Genie	could see → sich herumsah → denken konnte		**Explanation:** 	1. "galt" is a mistranslation of "considered". The reference uses "angesehen", which more accurately conveys the intended meaning in this context, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	2. "Genius" is a mistranslation of "genius". The reference uses "Genie", which is the correct German word for "genius". This fits the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	3. "sich herumsah" is a mistranslation of "could see". The reference "denken konnte" preserves the idiomatic meaning of "seeing around corners". The significant word error here is "herumsah" for "denken", aligning with **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.
adept → erfasst → versiert  	emissaries → Emissionen → Sonderbeauftragte  	massage → massakrieren → bearbeiten  	defang → vertreiben → unschädlich machen  		**Explanation:**  		1. "erfasst" (captured) is a mistranslation of "adept" (highly skilled), which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it incorrectly conveys his ability levels.	   	2. "Emissionen" (emissions) is a mistranslation of "emissaries" (diplomatic agents), which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because emissions cannot be used to interact with opponents.		3. "massakrieren" (massacre) is a mistranslation of "massage" (gently influence), significantly altering the intended meaning and violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.		4. "vertreiben" (expel) is a mistranslation of "defang" (render harmless), misrepresenting the intended method of dealing with opponents and thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
ground savvy → Bodenbesessenheit → grundlegendem Geschick		**Explanation:** "Bodenbesessenheit" (ground obsession) is a mistranslation of "ground savvy" (basic skillfulness or practical knowledge). This significantly alters the meaning and does not fit the intended context, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
obscurity → Obskurantität → undurchsichtigen  	fill → gefüllt → einzunehmen  		**Explanation:** "Obskurantität" translates to "obscurantism," which is incorrect in this context where "obscurity" relates to being unknown or not well-known. The correct concept is being "undurchsichtig" or unclear/obscure in recognition. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "gefüllt" means "filled" in a literal sense, while "einzunehmen" refers to taking a position or role. This translation error changes the intended meaning and violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
southerner → Süder → Süden  		**Explanation:** "Süder" is a mistranslation of "southerner." In German, the equivalent contextually would be to say someone "comes from the south" using "Süden," rather than using the nonstandard "Süder." This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it does not appropriately convey the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The primary elements of the source sentence, such as "analysts", "trust", "Tigrayan-controlled security services", and the general structure, are preserved in the candidate translation. The differences between "Analysten" and "Analytiker" are minor, and both are acceptable translations for "analysts". Similarly, the negation of trust ("kein Vertrauen" versus "nicht das Vertrauen... genießt") remains intact in meaning. Therefore, based on the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule and the preservation of the overall message, there are no significant translation errors to report.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although the sentence structure differs, the essential components, such as "fear" for "fürchten" (be afraid), "result" for "Ergebnis", and "bloodshed" for "Blutvergießen", are correctly translated. The differences are stylistic and do not constitute a meaningful error under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
analysts → niemand → Analytikern  	turmoil → Unruhen → Aufruhr  	appeared → gestürzt → scheinbar  		**Explanation:** 	1. "niemand" in the candidate sentence does not appear, but the intended "analysts" should be compared with "Analytikern" in the reference sentence. This wasn't addressed in the candidate, indicating a mistranslation.	2. "Unruhen" is a mistranslation of "turmoil", which is better captured by "Aufruhr" according to the reference.	3. "gestürzt" (overthrown) is used incorrectly for "appeared", which should be "scheinbar", as it alters the intended meaning of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon comparison, each word in the candidate sentence maintains the intended meaning from the source sentence. "ensuing crackdown" is translated appropriately as "anschließenden scharfen Vorgehen," "many protesters" as "viele Demonstranten," and the rest of the sentence structure supports a coherent and accurate translation of the source. Though there are some variations in phrasing, they do not detract from the overall meaning, thus adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
commuter → Computer → Pendler  		**Explanation:** "Computer" (computer) is a mistranslation of "commuter", which significantly changes the meaning as "Pendler" (commuter) refers to transportation specifically meant for commuting, not a computer. This error violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation is a valid rendering of the source sentence. The words "natürlich" and "offensichtlich" can both convey the meaning of "clearly" in this context, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Other key words such as "innere Entrüstung" for "internal resentment" and "zunimmt" for "intensifying" convey the intended meaning and do not significantly alter the sense of the sentence compared to the reference translation. Therefore, no errors are reported.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Und sie nimmt eine gefährliche ethnische Form an." is identical to the reference translation and accurately reflects the source sentence. No single-word errors are present, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** All words in the candidate translation align closely with the source and reference sentences, maintaining the intended meaning as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. The candidate uses structure and terminology that are acceptable variations, such as "demonstrators" vs. "Protestierende" and "businesses owned by" vs. "Unternehmen die gehören". The core message and its contextual meaning in the sentence are intact, thus adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
awkward → schwierige → eigenartige		**Explanation:** "schwierige" (difficult) is a mistranslation of "awkward". Although "schwierige" could imply a challenging situation, it misses the nuance of "awkward" meaning uncomfortable or embarrassing, which significantly changes the intended meaning in the context. This matches the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule since it alters the nuance conveyed by "awkward".
drones → Trockenflüge → Dronenflüge		**Explanation:** "Trockenflüge" (dry flights) is a mistranslation of "drones". The candidate sentence significantly changes the intended meaning by mistranslating this key element, as it refers to drone flights, not dry flights.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While there is a variation in wording between "will" and "möchte", and "instabilen" and "volatilen", these do not constitute meaningful errors because the translation accurately captures the original intent. Similarly, "zerbricht" and "zusammenbricht" both convey the idea of collapsing or falling apart. Thus, according to the criteria set by the instructions, no single-word translation errors exist in this context.
tight → enges → dünne  	rope → Europa → Gratwanderung  		**Explanation:** "enges" (tight) is a mistranslation of "tight" in the specific idiomatic context of "tight rope," which means "thin" in terms of a difficult path. The correct translation for "tight rope" in the given context conveying a difficult or delicate situation would be something similar to "dünne" (thin) or a concept like "Gratwanderung" (balancing act). Furthermore, "Europa" (Europe) is a mistranslation of "rope," which has been idiomatically used as part of "tight rope" to imply a challenging situation. The phrase should have been translated to something like "Gratwanderung" to correctly convey the idiomatic expression.
Obama-Founded-ISIS → Obama-Stiftung ISIS → Behauptung Obama habe ISIS gegründet  		**Explanation:** The phrase "Obama-Stiftung ISIS" suggests a foundation related to Obama and ISIS, which does not match the intended meaning of "Obama-Founded-ISIS" (Obama having founded ISIS). This is a significant mistranslation affecting the primary claim, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules. "Stiftung" (foundation) does not convey the concept of founding in the context of an organization being created, as intended in the source and reference.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	engulfing → auslöste → umgibt  	Islamic State → islamischen Terrorgruppe des Staates → Islamischer Staat  		**Explanation:**  	- "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump", as it incorrectly adds an extra letter 'f', violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "auslöste" (triggered) is a mistranslation of "engulfing", which changes the meaning of the sentence. The controversy was surrounding or engulfing the campaign rather than being initiated by it, aligning with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "islamischen Terrorgruppe des Staates" (Islamic terrorist group of the state) is an incorrect translation of "Islamic State". The correct reference term is "Islamischer Staat", which maintains the specific nomenclature of the group, addressing the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Republican → republikanischen → Republikaner  	nominee's → Präsidenten → Präsidentschaftskandidaten  		**Explanation:** The word "republikanischen" (republican) in the candidate translation is not consistent with "Republikaner" (Republicans) in the reference translation for the phrase "Republican presidential nominee". Moreover, "Präsidenten" (president) mistranslates "nominee's", which is intended to denote the candidate for the presidency—captured in the reference by "Präsidentschaftskandidaten" (presidential candidate). Both mistranslations significantly alter the intended context of the subject discussed in the source sentence, thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
strained → bemüht → bemühen  	surrogates → Umgebung → Mitstreiter  	awkward → schwierigen → eigentümliche  		**Explanation:** "bemüht" (endeavored) is not a mistranslation in this context, as "strained" implies a sense of effort which is captured in "bemühen". However, "Umgebung" (surroundings) is a mistranslation of "surrogates", which should more accurately be "Mitstreiter" (companions/allies). "schwierigen" (difficult) is a mistranslation of "awkward", which is better rendered as "eigentümliche" (peculiar/awkward) in this context.
suggestion → vorgeschlagen → Andeutung  	rally → Zusammenkunft → Wahlkampfveranstaltung  	doubled → verdoppelt → ruderte zurück  	assertion → Behauptung → Andeutung  	did intend to → wirklich beabsichtige → wirklich nicht beabsichtigte anzudeuten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "vorgeschlagen" is a mistranslation of "suggestion". The correct term "Andeutung" (implication) conveys the intended meaning more accurately.	2. "Zusammenkunft" (gathering) is a mistranslation of "rally", for which "Wahlkampfveranstaltung" (campaign event) is the appropriate context.	3. "verdoppelt" (doubled) is a mistranslation of "doubled down", incorrectly implying numerical increase rather than persistence, as communicated by "ruderete zurück" (backtracked).	4. "Behauptung" (assertion) mistranslates "implication", with "Andeutung" being the precise word.	5. "wirklich beabsichtige" lacks the negation present in the reference "nicht beabsichtigte anzudeuten", altering the essential intention of denial.
1. post → Posten → Tweet	2. Mr. → Herr → Mr.	3. Trump → Trumpf → Trump	4. sarcastic → Sarkasmus → sarkastisch		**Explanation:** 	- "Posten" is not the commonly used term for a Twitter message in German; "Tweet" is preferred.	- "Herr" is a general term for Mr., but in this context, especially with a common name like "Mr. Trump," the English "Mr." is often retained in German usage, hence it should be "Mr.".	- "Trumpf" is an incorrect translation of "Trump." It should remain "Trump."	- "Sarkasmus" (sarcasm) should be translated as "sarkastisch" (sarcastic), maintaining the adjective form rather than using a noun form that alters the meaning.
reversal → Umkehrung → Gegensatz  	post → Post → Tweet  	charge → Anklage → Anschuldigung  		**Explanation:** "Umkehrung" (reversal) is a mistranslation here as the correct context is more of "Gegensatz" (contrast/opposite), especially since it's referring to a change in stance or statement. "Post" (post) should have been translated as "Tweet" given the reference context, which changes the form of communication significantly. "Anklage" (charge) is inaccurate in this context, as "Anschuldigung" (accusation) fits better with what the subject "Mr. Trump" was being serious about.
1. host → Rundfunkveranstalter → Radiomoderator		**Explanation:** "Rundfunkveranstalter" (broadcast organizer) is a mistranslation of "host," which refers to a presenter or moderator in the context of a radio show.		2. soften → milderte → abzuschwächen		**Explanation:** "milderte" (milded/mitigated) is used as past tense in the candidate, while "abzuschwächen" (to soften) is the accurate infinitive form needed in the context.	   	3. Trump → Trumpf → Trump		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" is not a proper noun and does not accurately reflect the individual's name "Trump," thereby changing the intended reference. 		4. have it → hätte → wollte ... wissen		**Explanation:** "hätte" (would have) is incorrectly used here, since "wollte ... wissen" (did not want to hear) is the correct idiomatic expression indicating refusal or dismissal.
firestorm → Feuerwehrmann → Sturm der Kritik		**Explanation:** "Feuerwehrmann" (firefighter) is a mistranslation of "firestorm," which in this context refers to a metaphorical storm of criticism, not an individual. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the meaning significantly changes from a situation to a person.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	gave → gesprochen → hielten  	dueling → anläßlich der → zur Wirtschaftslage  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" is incorrect as the correct name is "Trump". "gesprochen" (spoken) does not accurately translate "gave" in the context of giving speeches, where "hielten" (held) is appropriate. "anläßlich der" (on the occasion of) does not capture the competitive nature of "dueling", for which "zur Wirtschaftslage" (about the economic situation) is more fitting in context.
Mr. → Herr → Mr.	Trumpf → Trump → Trump		**Explanation:** "Herr" (Mr.) is used instead of "Mr." directly in the reference, but it is acceptable in German translation, so it's not considered an error. The translation "Trumpf" is a clear mistake for "Trump". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Mrs. Clinton → Frau Clinton → Mrs. Clintons  	his → seine → ihre  		**Explanation:** "Frau Clinton" (Mrs. Clinton) is a slight mistranslation when compared to "Mrs. Clintons", but given the sentence context, we specifically focus on the possessive form. "seine" (his) is a mistranslation of "ihre" (her), which changes the attribution of the speech to the wrong person. This significantly changes the meaning as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it changes the proper noun significantly.
Russians → Russen → Russen  	hack → zerreißen → hacken		**Explanation:** "Russen" for "Russians" is correctly translated, thus there is no error there. However, "zerreißen" (tear apart) is a mistranslation of "hack". It violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes the intended meaning significantly in the context of cybersecurity. The correct translation should have been "hacken", which means to hack.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	speech → Reden → sprachlichen  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" (an incorrect spelling of "Trump") is a mistranslation of "Mr. Trump", violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it alters the proper noun. "Reden" (speeches) is a mistranslation of "speech" in this context as it fails to capture the nuance of "political speech" being a boundary or limit that can be moved, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it alters the thematic meaning.
fans → Fans → aufgenommen  	experte → Kommunikationsexperte → Kommunikationsexpertin		**Explanation:** 		1. "Fans" is not incorrect on its own, but "aufgenommen werden" in the reference provides a more specific sense that the messages are being received or embraced by the fans. However, "Fans" is acceptable, so this doesn't purely count as an error under the "Focus on Single-Word Errors" rule.	  	2. "Kommunikationsexperte" correctly translates to "communications expert", but in context, the reference uses "Kommunikationsexpertin" indicating the gender (female) of Ruth Sherman, who is actually referred to as "eine Kommunikationsexpertin" in German. This follows the "Ensure Contextual Accuracy" rule.		As for other phrases, the translation is generally correct or acceptable given the context and does not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence.
(licenses → Lizenzen → Weise)		**Explanation:** The word "lenses" was mistranslated as "Lizenzen" (licenses) instead of a term like "Weise" (ways), which fits the context of being a metaphorical filter for interpreting statements. This significantly alters the intended meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
tumble → gescheitert → zurückgegangen  	caustic → kausaleren → ätzenderen  		**Explanation:** "gescheitert" (failed) is a mistranslation of "tumble", which in this context should refer to "going down" or "falling" (as in poll numbers reducing). This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it alters the intended meaning related to poll statistics. "kausaleren" (more causal) is a mistranslation of "caustic", which should correctly refer to "biting" or "sarcastic" in this context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it does not convey the intended tone.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	margins → Margen → Vorsprüngen  	North Carolina → NordCarolina → North Carolina  	Clinton → Trumpf → Clinton  	locked → festsaß → Kopf-an-Kopf-Rennen  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump". "Margen" (margins) is incorrectly used; "Vorsprungen" (leads) or something similar would be correct in the context of polling data. "NordCarolina" should be "North Carolina" in this context. "Fahnen mit Frau Trumpf fährt" (flags with Mrs. Trump drives) is grammatically incorrect and alters the intended meaning, as "Clinton" should have been correctly translated instead of repeated and mistranslated as "Trumpf". "festsaß" (sat tight) misunderstands "locked in", which should convey the idea of being in a "tight race" or "Kopf-an-Kopf-Rennen".
Mr. → Herr → Mr.		Trump → Trumpf → Trump		misconstruing → falsch zu interpretieren → zu verzerren		understanding → missverstehen → falsch zu verstehen		**Explanation:** 		- "Mr." is specifically translated as "Herr" instead of maintaining the English form "Mr.", which is more typical for names in German, especially in journalistic contexts, hence a meaningful mistranslation.	- "Trump" is altered to "Trumpf", which is incorrect as names should remain unchanged; this violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "misconstruing" is translated as "falsch zu interpretieren" while the reference uses "zu verzerren". The translated phrase changes the nuance from distortion to simply a wrong interpretation, which is a significant change in meaning and violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "understanding" is mistranslated as "missverstehen" rather than "falsch zu verstehen," the latter being closer to the nuanced criticism the original implies, which follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by failing to convey the intended depth of misunderstanding linked with humor.
Trump → Trumpf → Trumps  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump", which changes the name of the individual referred to in the sentence. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the intended reference is to a specific person, Mr. Trump, and not a card game "trump" (or "trumpf" in German). 
Trump's → Trumpf → Trumps  	surrogates → Schauplätzen → Fürsprechern  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump's". In this context, "Trumpf" doesn't refer to the former president and changes the meaning.	2. "Schauplätzen" (locations) is a mistranslation of "surrogates", which refers to people or representatives. This significantly alters the intended meaning of the sentence.
Trump → Trumpf → Trumps		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Mr. Trump". The name should be rendered as "Trumps" to correctly reflect the English source and reference sentences. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the name "Trumpf" is incorrectly altered from its original form and does not fit the intended meaning in context.
jayvee → Jayeve → Hinterbänkler		**Explanation:** The word "Jayeve" in the candidate translation is a mistranslation of "jayvee," which refers to "junior varsity" or "Hinterbänkler" in this context, emphasizing a lesser or secondary status. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since it does not convey the intended meaning correctly.
secretary → Staatssekretär → Außenministerin  	fester → zugestanden → ausbreiten  		**Explanation:** "Staatssekretär" (junior minister) is incorrect; "Außenministerin" (foreign minister) is the accurate translation for "secretary of state" in this context, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "zugestanden" (allowed) misrepresents "fester" (to grow/worsen) since it alters the intended blame or oversight aspect, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	lash → aufgespült → Angriffe  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump" as it inaccurately alters the name. "Aufgespült" is a mistranslation of "lash out," which should convey the idea of attacking or criticizing, aligning better with "Angriffe." These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as altering the meaning and function of these words changes the intent significantly.
poor → armen → armen  	pathetic → erbärmlichen → jämmerlichen  	pundits → Fernsehsender → Fernsehexperten  	try → wollten → versuchen  	figure him out → herausfordern → verstehen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "armen" is correct in both candidate and reference for "poor", so no error here. However, there are multiple errors:  	2. "erbärmlichen" is a close equivalent to "jämmerlichen", but both are strong negative words fitting the context. However, "jämmerlichen" is the direct reference word, so more focus on other mismatches.	3. "Fernsehsender" (broadcasters) is a mistranslation of "pundits". "Fernsehexperten" (pundits) more accurately translates the role described.	4. "wollten" (wanted) differs from "versuchen" (try), altering the intention from ongoing effort to past desire.	5. "herausfordern" (challenge) is incorrect for "figure him out", where "verstehen" (understand) is correct, preserving the original meaning.
scoffed → getrieben → spotteten		**Explanation:** "getrieben" (driven) is a mistranslation of "scoffed". The candidate word does not convey the intended meaning of ridicule or derision, which is crucial to maintaining the original intent of the sentence. This error follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it changes the tone and meaning of the action described.
priced out → Preis out → über den Preis vom Markt verdrängt  	returns → Retings → kommt zurück  		**Explanation:** "Preis out" is not a valid German expression for "priced out," which means being unable to afford. The candidate uses an inappropriate English-German hybrid instead of the correct phrase "über den Preis vom Markt verdrängt." "Retings" is a misspelling and mistranslation of "returns," which should be "kommt zurück" in the context of a location. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
Café → space → Café  	served → diente → servierte  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Space" is a mistranslation of "Café". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Café" is the intended meaning in context rather than a generic "space".	2. "Diente" (served in the sense of serving duty) is a mistranslation of "served" when referring to serving coffee. The correct term, "servierte," aligns with the context of serving food or drinks.
1. it → er → wurde  	2. priced → erhielt → verdrängt  	3. storefront → Avenue → Ladenfront  		**Explanation:**  	- "er" is a mistranslation of "it". "er" (he) suggests gender, whereas "wurde" (was) is used for passive voice, aligning with "priced out".	- "erhielt" (received) is a mistranslation of "priced". The phrase "priced out" implies being pushed out by rising costs, which "verdrängt" (displaced) captures better in this context.	- "Avenue" remains untranslated where it should convey the specific location of the "storefront", making "Ladenfront" more accurate within the context.
store → Standort → Geschäft  	soaps → Höhen → Seife  	cupcakes → Höhen → Cupcakes  		**Explanation:**  	- "Standort" (location) is a mistranslation of "store", changing the subject of the sentence significantly. This violates both the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Contextual Accuracy** rules, as the subject is supposed to reference a store.	- "Höhen" (heights) is a mistranslation of "soaps" and "cupcakes". The word "Höhen" changes the meaning entirely, violating the same rules, because it does not match "Seife" (soaps) or "Cupcakes".
locals → Lokalbevölkerung → Einheimische  	gentrifying → wundervollen → sich gentrifizierenden  		**Explanation:** "Lokalbevölkerung" (local population) is a mistranslation of "locals" (Einheimische), as it does not accurately capture the intended casual group reference. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Wundervollen" (wonderful) is a mistranslation of "gentrifying," which significantly changes the meaning and sentiment of the sentence. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it alters the context of urban decline to something overly positive.
artist → Künstler → Künstlerin  	gutted → gepfercht → ausgenommen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Künstler" (artist in masculine form) is a mistranslation of "artist" in this context, which refers to Molly Crabapple, a female artist. Hence, it should be "Künstlerin" to maintain gender accuracy. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the gender context is explicitly stated.	   	2. "gepfercht" (crammed) is not the correct translation for "gutted" in this context. The verb "ausgenommen", meaning "gutted" or "emptied out", is more contextually accurate for describing the status of the Chelsea Hotel, fitting the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
change → ändert → Veränderung  		**Explanation:** "ändert" (changes) is a mistranslation of "change". The source implies New York itself embodies change as a state or quality, rather than an action, which is why "Veränderung" (a noun form representing change as a concept) is more appropriate here. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, and while there are minor variations in phrasing (e.g., "letzten November" vs "im November letzten Jahres" and "von seinem ursprünglichen Standort" vs "des ursprünglichen Standorts"), these do not significantly change the meaning of the sentence. Thus, per the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no errors are reported.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:**  	- "unanmaßende" (unpretentious) as a translation of "schlichte" maintains the intended meaning and tone, thus acceptable.	- "vibe" used in both candidate and source is appropriate as it retains the original term's casual nuance.  	- An overall comparison shows that the candidate translation conveys the same core message, indicating adherence to context. The rules for handling ambiguity carefully and focusing on meaningful errors have been observed, leading to no significant mistranslation detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Der Kaffee ist auch noch gut." conveys the same meaning as the source sentence "The coffee is still good, too." Both "noch" and "noch immer" are used to express continuity in this context, and the given translation accurately reflects the source sentence's intent. Therefore, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, there are no significant mistranslations to report.
Leading → geleitet → Besitzer  	general → Generalmanager → Geschäftsführer  	Place → Ort → Cafés  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Leading" was mistranslated as "geleitet" instead of "Besitzer," which changes the role that Cisco Rodriguez occupies significantly.	2. "general" was translated as "Generalmanager" (which is an acceptable translation), but "Geschäftsführer" is a more accurate translation in this context, fitting the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	3. "Place" was translated to "Ort" instead of "Cafés," which changes the context from a specific type of establishment to a more general location, fitting the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While the candidate translation "Er begann 2001 in Verb und war bis zum Ende dort." simplifies the notion of working at Verb compared to the reference translation "Er begann 2001 bei Verb zu arbeiten und blieb dort bis zum Ende.", it retains the core meaning. The simplification of "begann 2001 bei Verb zu arbeiten" to "begann 2001 in Verb" and "blieb dort bis zum Ende" to "war bis zum Ende dort" do not significantly alter the intended meaning. It follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, confirming no significant single-word errors are present.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and the reference translation convey the same overall meaning. The words used, such as "finanzieren" (to finance) and "Geldmittel bereitzustellen" (to provide funds), though different, are suitable translations in context. Other components in the translation do not significantly alter meaning or context. Therefore, no single-word errors that significantly change the sentence's meaning are found.
Mr. → sich → Herr  		**Explanation:** "sich" (reflexive pronoun) is incorrectly used in place of "Mr." (Herr) in the source sentence. While the candidate translation attempts to convey a different grammatical structure, the misalignment indicates a significant error in capturing "Mr." correctly as "Herr". This affects the proper naming and respect conveyed in the context. Since this error violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule and does not accurately reflect the source sentence, it is noted down as a mistranslation.
bagels → Gäsel → Bagels  	espresso → Druckmaschine → Espressomaschinen  		**Explanation:** "Gäsel" is a clear mistranslation of "bagels". There may have been a typographical error, but it significantly changes the meaning. "Druckmaschine" (printing machine) is a mistranslation of "espresso machine", which alters the intended meaning of the equipment involved. Both errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
lights → Licht → Lampen  		**Explanation:** "Licht" (light) is a mistranslation of "lights", which in this context refers to multiple light fixtures, not a singular "light". This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, as the candidate uses the singular form instead of the plural.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both the candidate and the reference translations communicate the same meaning, despite slight structural differences. The candidate uses a slightly different construction but does not contain any words that significantly alter the intended meaning of the source sentence. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, focusing only on mistranslation of words that change meaning, which is not the case here.
No translation errors detected.
bacon → Bacone → Speck  	egg → und → -  	sandwiches → Sandwiche → Sandwiches  	toppings → Küchenkäse → Garnierungen  	capers → Kapper → Kapern  	sautéed → sautete → sautierte  	onions → Oonen → Zwiebeln  		**Explanation:**  	- "Bacone" is a mistranslation of "bacon". "Speck" is the correct German word.	- "und" is an addition, resulting from a mistranslation of "egg". The actual egg component is omitted.	- "Sandwiche" is an incorrect plural form of "sandwiches". The correct translation maintains the term "Sandwiches", which can be used in German for plural.	- "Küchenkäse" is unrelated to "toppings"; it introduces an incorrect concept of "kitchen cheese".	- "Kapper" is a typographical error or incorrect transliteration for "capers". The correct translation is "Kapern".	- "sautete" is a mistranslation of "sautéed", leading to a typographical variant that should be "sautierte".	- "Oonen" is a mistranslation of "onions". The correct word is "Zwiebeln".
brown-rice → BrownReis → Naturreis  	bowls → Bowls → Schüsseln  		**Explanation:** "BrownReis" is a mistranslation of "brown-rice" because "Brown" should be translated as "Natur" in the context of brown rice in German. "Bowls" is a mistranslation as well, since "Schüsseln" fits the context better in German. These mistranslations violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as they are not correctly adapted to the target language.
cafe → Sichere → Café  	serves → dient → serviert  	fresh → neue → frische  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Sichere" (secure) is a mistranslation of "cafe". This significantly changes the meaning of the sentence since "Sichere" does not refer to a place serving beverages.	2. "dient" (serves as in serving a function) is a mistranslation of "serves" in the context of providing drinks or food at a café. The correct word should be "serviert".	3. "neue" (new) is a mistranslation of "fresh" in the context of juices. The correct word should be "frische", which aligns with providing drinks that are freshly made.
months → Monaten → Monaten  	regulars → Regelwerke → Stammkunden  		**Explanation:** "Monaten" is correct here but included to demonstrate it is not a mistranslation; however, we should focus on "Regelwerke", which means "rulebooks" in English, a clear mistranslation of "regulars" (Stammkunden). The word "Regelwerke" changes the meaning by substituting "customers" with something entirely unrelated, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
former → ehemalige → alte  	priced (out) → einen Preis bekommen → verdrängt  		**Explanation:** "ehemalige" (former) and "alte" (old) can be considered acceptable synonyms, but "ehemalige" is closer to the intended meaning. Therefore, no error is listed for the first word. However, "einen Preis bekommen" (got a price) does not convey the same meaning as "verdrängt" (priced out), which is a crucial change in the context of the sentence, resulting in a translation error.
recent → letzten → kürzlich		**Explanation:** "letzten" (last) is a mistranslation of "recent". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "last Sunday" refers to a specific past time rather than "a recent Sunday," which is more general in the given context.
Ms. → Herr → (none, it should be a gender-neutral or female title)  	went → war → besuchte  
trek → Ball → Weg  		**Explanation:** "Ball" (ball) is a mistranslation of "trek", which incorrectly conveys the meaning of the sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because making a "ball" does not align with the intended concept of taking a journey or a trek.
Verb → Schließung → geschlossen	said → darauf → sagte	gave up → verzichtet → gab auf		**Explanation:**		1. "Verb" is referring to a proper noun in the source, but "Schließung" (closure) is not the correct translation; "geschlossen" (closed) aligns better with "closed."	   	2. "Said" does not match "darauf" in the candidate, which does not seem to fit any part of the source or reference meaningfully; "sagte" is the correct equivalent for "said."		3. "Gave up" is translated as "verzichtet" (foregone), which while similar, "gab auf" (gave up) is more precise given the context of the source sentence.
coffee → Kaffee → Kaffee  	culture → Kultur → Kultur  	realized → liebe → klar  	liked → liebe → gefiel  		**Explanation:** "Kaffee" (coffee) and "Kultur" (culture) are correctly translated and align with the reference. The word "realized" is mistranslated as "liebe" (love), whereas it should convey the meaning of "klar" (realized). Additionally, the word "liebe" (love) for "liked" changes the sentiment; the correct translation should express a past tense preference, like "gefiel" (liked). These corrections are necessary under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
back → Rücken → wieder  	blended → verschnittenen → Blended  		**Explanation:** 	- "Rücken" (back) is a mistranslation in this context. The phrase should convey returning to a habit rather than a physical back, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The correct word for returning to a habit is "wieder".	- "verschnittenen" (blended) is more commonly used for cut wine, which does not fit the context of a beverage type like a "chai drink". The direct borrowing "Blended" is used in German for such drinks, adhering to the original term and avoiding the change in implied meaning, fulfilling the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely follows the structure and meaning of the source sentence. While the candidate and reference translations have different structures, they convey the same fundamental information: Tom Rosenthal, as a long-term customer, has been involved with Verb starting in 2003. Both translations emphasize the timeline and the faithfulness of the customer. No single-word translation errors significantly affect the meaning.
go → stehen → ging  	order → anordnen → bestellte  		**Explanation:** "stehen" (stand) is a mistranslation of "go", which changes the intended action. "anordnen" (order, as in to command) is a mistranslation of "order" (as in to request or purchase), changing the context of what he is doing regularly. Both errors affect the overall context and continuity of the narrative.
quarter → Viertel → viertel  	past → um → nach  	everything bagel → alles → Everything-Bagel  		**Explanation:** "Viertel" (quarter), while a direct translation, needs to combine with "nach" to mean "quarter past" in the context of time, which makes "um" incorrect. "um" (at) does not convey the correct meaning of "past." Lastly, "alles" (everything) is not a correct translation for "everything bagel," which is a specific noun that, much like in English, can remain "Everything-Bagel" to maintain its specific meaning.
experiment → versuchen → experimentieren  	ingredients → Inhaltsstoffe → Zutaten  		**Explanation:** 	- "versuchen" (try) is a mistranslation of "experiment". Although both involve attempting something, "experimentieren" more accurately conveys the context of experimenting as intended in the source.	- "Inhaltsstoffe" (contents) is a mistranslation of "ingredients". "Zutaten" is more appropriate as it directly refers to components used in cooking or preparing meals, fitting the reference and context better.
order → Reihenfolge → Bestellung  	switch → ausschalten → wechselt  	bacon → Back → Speck  	everything → allen → Everything  		**Explanation:** The word "Reihenfolge" (sequence) is a mistranslation of "order," which should be "Bestellung" (order in the sense of a purchase). "Ausschalten" (turn off) is a mistranslation of "switch," which would be more accurately translated as "wechselt" (switch/adapt). "Back" is incorrect for "bacon," which should be "Speck." Additionally, "allen" (all) is a mistranslation of "everything" in the context of a bagel, where the specific term "Everything" is used in German as well.
hard → großes → Groll		**Explanation:** "großes" (big) is a mistranslation of "hard", which in this context should convey "no hard feelings" as "keinen Groll". This significantly changes the intended emotional meaning of the sentence.
offered → angeboten → boten	cold-brewed → kalten → kaltgebrühten	cafe's → Kaffee → Cafés  		**Explanation:** "angeboten" is a grammatically incorrect form for "offered" in this context. The correct past tense form is "bieten", which is "boten" in past simple. "kalten" (cold) misses the "brewed" aspect of "cold-brewed", which is conveyed by "kaltgebrühten". Finally, "Kaffee" (coffee) mistranslates the possessive form "cafe's", which should be "Cafés" to indicate that the coffee belongs to the cafe.
think → glaube → denke  	take → aufgreifen → eingehen  	it → sie → Angebot  		**Explanation:**  	1. "glaube" (believe) is a mistranslation of "think". This word choice changes the speaker's level of certainty and violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "aufgreifen" (pick up) is a mistranslation in this context, where "eingehen" (take up) aligns more closely with the intended meaning of engaging with an offer, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	3. "sie" (them) is substituted incorrectly here, as the correct translation should connect to "it", referring to the offer ("Angebot") in this context, aligning with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
cafe → Schutzschild → Café  		**Explanation:** "Schutzschild" (shield) is a mistranslation of "cafe" and significantly changes the intended meaning of the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence. Each portion of the sentence maintains the intended meaning, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. While there are differences in phrasing between the candidate and reference, such as "zeigen" and "auszustellen" or "einen Ort zu finden" compared to the reference, these differences do not significantly alter the meaning of the overall sentence in context. Hence, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no significant single-word translation errors are detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "Standort" is accurately translated as "location". The phrase "hat andere Vorteile" (has other perks) sufficiently captures the intended meaning of "has other perks". Variations in expressing "new" and "perks" do not change the overall meaning significantly. The candidate sentence remains contextually accurate, thus following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no errors are reported.
local juice spot → örtlicher Saft → örtliches Saftlokal  	cold-brewed → kalten → kaltgebrühten  		**Explanation:** "örtlicher Saft" (local juice) is a mistranslation of "local juice spot". The reference uses "örtliches Saftlokal", indicating the location (spot/place) rather than just the type of beverage. "kalten" (cold) is a mistranslation of "cold-brewed", as this misses the brewing aspect of the coffee described in "kaltgebrühten".
chance → Fahrzeug → Café	expand → ausbreitet → expandiert		**Explanation:** "Fahrzeug" (vehicle) is a mistranslation of "cafe", which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because vehicles do not fit the context of expanding into buildings. "Ausbreitet" (spreads) is a mistranslation of "expand", which is crucial as it changes the intended action. Following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, the errors are extracted at the word level.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Für viele Kunden reicht ein neues Verb, um ihre alten Favoriten zu erhalten." conveys the same meaning as the reference. Both "erhalten" and "bekommen" can translate to "get" in this context, observing the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, no significant single-word translation errors are present.
regular → regelmäßig → Stammkunde  	heartbroken → zerbrochen → am Boden zerstört  		**Explanation:** "regelmäßig" (regular) does not capture the intended nuance of "Stammkunde" (patron or regular customer). This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the relationship with the establishment. "zerbrochen" (broken) is a mistranslation of "heartbroken" and does not convey the emotional context of "am Boden zerstört" (devastated), following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
new → neue → neuen  	space → Raum → Café  	opened → eröffnet wurde → eröffnete  	walking in → einmarschierte → Betreten des Lokals  	getting → bekam → Bestellen  		**Explanation:**  	- "neue" is incorrectly matched with "neue" (new) in the reference translation because of its context with "Kaffee", where it should accurately describe the "new coffee" as "neuen".	- "Raum" (room/space) is a mistranslation of "space" when the context specifically refers to a "Café".	- "eröffnet wurde" (was opened) differs slightly from "eröffnete" (opened), which is a simpler form in the reference.	- "einmarschierte" (marching in) is too forceful and does not match the context of "walking in", where "Betreten des Lokals" (entering the premises) fits better.	- "bekam" (got) is not as contextually accurate as "Bestellen" (ordering) in relation to "getting a coffee".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation matches the reference translation exactly. There are no single-word translation errors when comparing the candidate to the source and reference sentences. Thus, following the **No translation errors detected** rule, no errors are reported.
Depression → Depression → Wirtschaftskrise  	Food → Lebensmittel → Essen  	Square → Platz → reichlichen  	Meal → Mehl → Mahlzeit  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Depression" (Depression) is a mistranslation of the economic term "Depression" in this context, which refers to "Wirtschaftskrise" (economic depression), aligning with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Lebensmittel" (food item) is more about "groceries" or "provisions" rather than "Essen" (food) in the given context, which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it misrepresents the nature of "Food".	3. "Platz" (place) does not align with "Square" in the figurative sense used here, where "reichlichen" (ample/abundant) is more appropriate given the context, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	4. "Mehl" (flour) is an incorrect translation for "Meal", which should have been "Mahlzeit" (meal), violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
presidency → Erscheinen → Aufstieg
taste → schmerzhafte → Faible  	fancy → schmerzhafte → raffinierte  	foods → Avenue-Lebensmittel → Delikatessen  	terrapin → Terrapin → Wasserschildkrötensuppe  		**Explanation:** 	1. "schmerzhafte" (painful) is a mistranslation of "taste" and "fancy," changing the intended meaning significantly.	2. "Avenue-Lebensmittel" (Avenue foods) inaccurately translates "fancy Fifth Avenue foods," which should refer to "Delikatessen."	3. "Terrapin" remains untranslated, while it should refer to "Wasserschildkrötensuppe" (Maryland terrapin soup).
deviled eggs → Drahtzieher → gefüllte Eier  	tomato sauce → Tomatensäure → Tomatensauce  	mashed potatoes → zerrissene Kartoffeln → Kartoffelpüree  	dessert → Wüstenstaub → Dessert  	prune pudding → Rintwein → Pflaumenpudding  		**Explanation:**  	- "Drahtzieher" (literal translation to 'mastermind/instigator') is a mistranslation of "deviled eggs", which should be "gefüllte Eier" (stuffed eggs) in this context. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule as "Drahtzieher" represents incorrect food item.	- "Tomatensäure" (tomato acid) is a mistranslation of "tomato sauce", which significantly changes the meaning to imply a chemical rather than a culinary context, violating **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.	- "zerrissene Kartoffeln" (torn potatoes) is an incorrect translation of "mashed potatoes." which should be "Kartoffelpüree". This changes the preparation method significantly, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Wüstenstaub" (desert dust) is incorrectly translated for "dessert," which should remain "Dessert", violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the food context is lost.	- "Rintwein" (misspelling attempting 'red wine') does not correspond to "prune pudding," which should be "Pflaumenpudding," affecting the dish context as per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. "der kulinarischen Solidarität" and "kulinarischer Solidarität" both convey "culinary solidarity" with minor grammatical differences that don't affect meaning significantly enough to be considered errors. Similarly, "den leidenden Menschen" and "leidenden Leuten" are both correct translations of "people who were suffering," observing the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. The use of "ihr Mann" instead of "ihr Ehemann" is a valid alternative and does not change the meaning. Similarly, "wie man essen kann" versus "wie sie essen sollten" are acceptable variations in this context. The sentence effectively communicates the original message, in adherence to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
couple → Paare → Ehepaar  		**Explanation:** "Paare" (pairs) is a mistranslation of "couple" in this context, where "Ehepaar" (married couple) is more accurate and specific to referring to two people who are likely married. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "Paare" refers to multiple pairs rather than a single couple.
life → Festhalten → Leben		**Explanation:** "Festhalten" translates to "capture" or "hold," which is a mistranslation of the word "life" in this context. The reference correctly translates "life" as "Leben," maintaining the intended meaning of the sentence. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as the candidate's choice significantly alters the meaning.
Square → Platz → anständige  	Meal → Mal → Mahlzeit  	work → Arbeit → Zusammenarbeit  	history → Geschichte → illustriert  	food → Lebensmittel → Küche  		**Explanation:**   	1. "Platz" (place) is a mistranslation for "Square" in the title "A Square Meal". The candidate translation "Ein Platz Mal" incorrectly translates the intended title, where "anständige" is used for sense of "square" meaning "decent".	2. "Mal" (time/occasion) is mistranslated for "Meal" in the title "A Square Meal", whereas "Mahlzeit" is the correct term for "meal".	3. "Arbeit" (work) is mistranslated for "collaborative work", where "Zusammenarbeit" correctly conveys the sense of "collaboration".	4. "Geschichte" (history) is not the closest translation when it relates to how the collaboration narrates or "illustriert" (illustrates) rather than merely being "a history".	5. "Lebensmittel" (foodstuffs) is a mistranslation for "food", as "Küche" (cuisine) is more contextual and reflects the broader notion of "history of American food".
district → Gebiet → District  	crash → Unglücks → Börsencrash  		**Explanation:** "Gebiet" (area) is a mistranslation of "district", which is specific in the context. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because Flatiron is officially referred to as a district. "Unglücks" (disaster) is a mistranslation of "crash", specifically referring to the significant economic event known as the stock market crash, which is commonly termed "Börsencrash" in German. This fits the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the timing and historical context require specificity.
cream cheese → Käse → Frischkäse  	chopped → gepumpten → Olivenstückchen  	sandwich → Olivensandwich → Sandwich  	turkey → Truthülse → Truthahn  	mashed → zerrissene → Kartoffelpüree  	vegetable → pflanzliche → Gemüsemischung  		**Explanation:**  	- "Käse" (cheese) is a mistranslation of "cream cheese," as it lacks the specificity of "Frischkäse" (cream cheese).	- "gepumpten" (pumped) inaccurately translates "chopped," which should be "Olivenstückchen" (chopped olive pieces) to retain the intended meaning.	- "Olivensandwich" conflates "cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich" into one word, losing clarity that it's a "Sandwich" with multiple ingredients.	- "Truthülse" does not accurately convey "turkey," which should be "Truthahn."	- "zerrissene" (torn) incorrectly translates "mashed" as "Kartoffelpüree" (mashed potatoes).	- "pflanzliche" (plant-based) erroneously conveys "vegetable," which should be "Gemüsemischung" (vegetable medley) to complete the original meaning.
reporter → Berichterstatter → Reporter  	meatloaf → Fleisch → Hackbraten  		**Explanation:** "Berichterstatter" is a more general term ("reporter" can be translated as "Berichterstatter" or "Reporter"), but "Reporter" is more fitting in this context according to the reference. "Fleisch" (meat) is an incorrect translation of "meatloaf", as it changes the specific food item being referred to in the source sentence. "Hackbraten" (meatloaf) is needed to preserve the intended meaning.
loaves → Liebe → Lebensmittel		**Explanation:** "Liebe" (love) is a mistranslation of "loaves", which refers to food items, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The correct translation in the context of the sentence, as per the reference, is "Lebensmittel" (foodstuffs). This significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, making "Liebe" a notable error.
peanut → Peantenlaib → Erdnuss  	loaf → -frei → -käse  	bean → Sojabohnen → Bohnen  	loaf → - (missing) → -brot  		**Explanation:** The word "Peantenlaib" is a mistranslation of "peanut loaf" where "Peantenlaib" does not correctly convey "Erdnuss". The word "-frei" used in "Leberfrei" does not accurately translate the "loaf" part of "liver loaf", failing to capture the type of food, compared to "Leberkäse". "Sojabohnen" (soybeans) is incorrect for "bean loaf", which should be "Bohnenbrot". Additionally, the translation omits the "loaf" part from "bean loaf", leaving it incomplete.
ingredient → Inhaltsstoff → Zutat  	thing → Ware → etwas  		**Explanation:** "Inhaltsstoff" (ingredient) slightly changes the intended meaning as "Zutat" (ingredient) fits the context better, giving a sense of a single culinary component rather than a more general substance. "Ware" (commodity/goods) significantly alters the meaning of "thing," pointing to a specific item type rather than "etwas" (something), which is a more generic term matching the source. This adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
peanuts → Peanuts → Erdnüsse  	serve → essen → dienen  		**Explanation:** "Peanuts" is not translated into German as "Erdnüsse", which is the correct translation. Additionally, "essen" (eat) is used instead of "dienen" (serve), which significantly alters the intended meaning of the sentence. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it changes the context and meaning.
grimaced → gegriffen → grinste  		**Explanation:** "gegriffen" (grabbed) is a mistranslation of "grimaced". This significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, as it describes a different action, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
sat → sitzen → gelegt  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "sitzen" (sit) whereas the reference uses "gelegt haben" (have laid), relating to "sat" in a metaphorical sense within the source. This significantly impacts the aspect of the expression, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Depression → Depression → Großen Depression  	table → Tisch → Tisch in einem amerikanischen Haushalt  	all-you-can-eat → allumfassender → All-You-Can-Eat  	Puffer → Puffer → Buffet  		**Explanation:** 		1. **Depression → Depression → Großen Depression:** The candidate translation omits "Großen" (Great), which is crucial as it refers to the specific historical event known as the Great Depression.	 	2. **table → Tisch → Tisch in einem amerikanischen Haushalt:** The source specifies "the American table", which is a cultural reference to abundance in American households. The candidate misses this nuance by translating directly as "Tisch".		3. **all-you-can-eat → allumfassender → All-You-Can-Eat:** "Allumfassender" (all-encompassing) diverges from "All-You-Can-Eat," which is a specific phrase indicating unlimited food, significantly changing the meaning related to abundance.		4. **Puffer → Puffer → Buffet:** "Puffer" is incorrect; "Buffet" is the suitable translation. The error changes the meaning from a laid-out meal to something potentially unrelated or misunderstood.
Teams → Frauenmannschaften → Mannschaften  	farmworkers → Bauern → Feldarbeiter  	pie → gekleidet → gebackene Pastete  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Frauenmannschaften" (women teams) misunderstands the structure and intent of "Teams of women" in this context, where "Mannschaften" suffices. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	2. "Bauern" (farmers) changes the meaning from "farmworkers", which are specifically "Feldarbeiter". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	3. "gekleidet" (dressed) is a complete mistranslation of "pie", which should be "gebackene Pastete". The error substantially changes the meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Square → Platz → Square  	Meal → Mehl → Meal  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Ein Platz Mehl" mistranslates "A Square Meal." The German word "Platz" means "square" in the sense of a public space, like a town square, whereas "Square" in the sense of "A Square Meal" refers to a complete or substantial meal. Similarly, "Mehl" means "flour," which is a mistranslation of "Meal" since it refers to a type of food ingredient rather than a meal. Both these errors transform the title's intended meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules by mistranslating key terms in the title.
fraught → bösartiges → angespanntes		**Explanation:** "bösartiges" (malicious) is a mistranslation of "fraught", which should have been translated as "angespanntes" (tense). The candidate translation alters the intended meaning, shifting it from "tense or filled with tension" to "malicious," which doesn't fit the context.
equally → ebenso → genauso  	fraught → spitzfindig → angespannt  	budget → Haushalt → Budget  	diet → Ernährung → Diät  	mystery → Mysterialblätter → Geheimnisvolle  	dishes → Lieben → Speisen  	loaves → Lieben → Brote  	casseroles → Kasseln → Kasserollen  	staples → Spielblättern → Grundnahrungsmittel  	casserole → Klausel → Kasserolle  	noted → hat darauf hingewiesen → merkte an  	cooks → Coks → Köche  	unappetizing → nicht appetitierende → unappetitliche  	creamy → Cama von Saat → kremigen Sauce  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation contains multiple mistranslations that significantly alter the meaning of the text. Each of the words listed as mistranslations does not align with the source and reference sentence meanings, impacting understanding in context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation perfectly matches the reference translation, and all words are translated correctly without changing the intended meaning. Since there are no discrepancies, it follows the **No translation errors detected** outcome.
years → Jahrelang → jahrelang  	center → Zentrum → Mittelpunkt  	meal → Tiermehls → Küche  	sparingly → wenig → selten  		**Explanation:**  	- "Jahrelang" (capitalized) is a mistranslation of "years". It should be "jahrelang" to properly modify the noun and align with the English meaning.	- "Zentrum" (center) is translated accurately, but in German culinary context, "Mittelpunkt" is more idiomatic when referring to the dominance in cuisine.	- "Tiermehls" (animal meal) is a mistranslation of "meal". The intended context is a meal in the sense of a dining or culinary concept, rather than a literal "animal meal". "Küche" (cuisine) correctly conveys this context.	- "wenig" (little) does not fully convey the meaning of "sparingly" in the context of an infrequent luxury. "selten" (rarely) better conveys the infrequency of serving meat.
strange → Maschinen → Mischungen  	mashups → Maschinen → Mischungen  	nutritional → Ernährungserfüllung → nährhafte  	sense → Küchensinn → Küchenverstand  		**Explanation:**  	- "Maschinen" (machines) is a mistranslation of both "strange" and "mashups". It significantly alters the meaning as "Maschinen" does not relate to the intended "mashups".  	- "Ernährungserfüllung" (nutritional fulfillment) is a confusing translation that doesn't match the simpler "nährhafte" (nutritious).  	- "Küchensinn" (kitchen sense) is incorrect, as a better-fitting translation in this context would be "Küchenverstand" (kitchen sense/common sense).
recipes → Peanus-Butter → Rezepte  	period → Zeitspanne → Epoche  	dish → Köchen → Gericht  	onion → Peanus-Butter → Zwiebeln  		**Explanation:**  	- "Peanus-Butter" is a typographical error for "Peanut Butter" and has appeared in place of "recipes". The correct translation should have been "Rezepte".	- "Zeitspanne" (time span) is an incorrect translation for "period" in this context, where the intended meaning is a time-specific dish from an "Epoche" (era/epoch).	- "Köchen" (cooks) misinterprets "dish," which should be "Gericht."	- "Peanus-Butter" is also incorrectly appearing in the place of "onion", which was intended to be "Zwiebeln."
popular → beliebte → beliebter  	addition → Ergänzung → Zusatz  	dinner → Abendessen → Mittagstisch  	table → (not explicitly translated, hence zero translation) → Tisch  		**Explanation:**  	1. **popular → beliebte → beliebter**: The gender and case agreement in German requires "beliebter" for the masculine noun "Zusatz".	2. **addition → Ergänzung → Zusatz**: "Ergänzung" does not convey the same meaning as "Zusatz" in this context, which refers specifically to an item added to the meal.	3. **dinner → Abendessen → Mittagstisch**: "Mittagstisch" specifically refers to the concept of a lunch table and aligns with the reference, whereas "Abendessen" translates to "dinner."	4. **table → (not explicitly translated, hence zero translation) → Tisch**: There is an omission of the translation for "table," which should be simply "Tisch" in the reference sentence.
**(amplified → erklärte → führt weiter aus)**		**Explanation:** "erklärte" (explained) is a mistranslation of "amplified". The word "erklärte" changes the intended meaning of the original sentence where "amplified" implies elaboration or adding detail rather than simply explaining. The correct translation aligns more with "führt weiter aus," meaning to further elaborate or expand, which matches the context intended by "amplified," adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
peanut → Peanuts → Erdnuss  	butter → Butter → -  	baked → bösen → gebackene  	onion → Epoche → Zwiebeln  		**Explanation:** 	- "Peanuts" is incorrect as the source refers to "Peanut", which should be translated as "Erdnuss" in the compound "Erdnussbutter". Each part of the compound is considered individually as per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "bösen" (evil) is a mistranslation of "baked", which changes the description of "onion". A reference to cooking, i.e., "gebackene", is necessary here to maintain the correct meaning, in line with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Epoche" (epoch) is a mistranslation of "onion", which alters the entire context. The expected translation is "Zwiebeln".
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence translates "characteristic" to "charakteristisch," which aligns well with the meaning. The term "home-ec" is typically an abbreviation for "home economics" and is left untranslated, which is sometimes acceptable in translation if taken as a familiar term or abbreviation. The rest of the translation aligns correctly with the reference sentence without a significant change in meaning.
home economists → einheimische Ökonomen → Haushaltswirtschaftler  	drove → verdrängt → trieben  		**Explanation:** "einheimische Ökonomen" (domestic economists) is a mistranslation of "home economists", significantly altering the specific profession referenced. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the role of household economists is unique and unrelated to general economists. "verdrängt" (displaced) is a mistranslation of "drove", changing the meaning of the sentence from actively influencing habits to replacing them. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
recipes → Rezepten → Rezepte	encouraged → ermutigt → ermutigten	glop → Glas → Pampe	carrots → Zuckerbrot → Karotten
square → Quadrat → Square  	meal → Mehl → Meal  	feast → Fiest → Fest  	tidbits → Reizen → Leckerbissen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Quadrat" (square as in geometric shape) is a mistranslation of "Square" in the title "A Square Meal," which should remain untranslated.	2. "Mehl" (flour) is a mistranslation of "Meal," which should also remain as part of the untranslated title.	3. "Fiest" is misspelled and should be "Fest" to correctly translate "feast."	4. "Reizen" (charms/appeals) is a mistranslation of "tidbits," which should be "Leckerbissen" (tidbits/delicacies).
government's → Selbstherrlichkeit → Regierung	accounts → Selbstherrlichkeit → Berichte	citizenry → Bürgerschaft → Bürger	let-me-eat-cake → Letzerkuchen → Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Selbstherrlichkeit" (arrogance) is a mistranslation of both "government's" and "accounts", which changes the intended meaning significantly and violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Bürgerschaft" (citizenship) is a mistranslation of "citizenry", which refers to people, thus affecting contextual accuracy.	- "Letzerkuchen" does not convey the idiomatic expression "let-me-eat-cake", failing the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
praised → lobte → lobte  	simple → einfache → einfache  	Iowa → Iowa → Iowa  	farmhouse → Bauernkochen → Bauernhausküche  	cooking → Bauernkochen → Küche  	dined → befand → speiste  	sophisticate → Komplex → Mann von Welt  		**Explanation:**  	- "Bauernkochen" (farm cooking) should be "Bauernhausküche" (farmhouse kitchen). This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule as the source and reference imply a specific kind of cuisine associated with a type of house, not just cooking in general.	- "befand" (found himself) is incorrect in the context of the sentence. The correct translation would be "speiste" (dined), following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Komplex" (complex) is a mistranslation of "sophisticate", which should be "Mann von Welt" (man of the world). However, per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, "sophisticate" is reduced to "Komplex" as the core error.
fish → Fische → Fisch  	cucumber sauce → Gurkensäure → Gurkensauce  		**Explanation:** "Fische" (plural: fishes) is a mistranslation of "fish" (singular), which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Gurkensäure" (cucumber acid) is a significant mistranslation of "cucumber sauce", which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule due to the inappropriate substitution and significant change in meaning.
ate → sitzt → aß  	gold-plated → Gold-platt → vergoldetem  	dining room → Raum → Speisezimmer  	dinner jacket → Essensjacke → Smoking  		**Explanation:** "sitzt" (sits) is a mistranslation of "ate" which changes the action in the sentence, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Gold-platt" (Gold-plated) is a direct mistranslation, as "gold-plated" should be "vergoldetem" in the context of describing a "dining room". "Raum" (room) does not capture the specific context of "dining room", where "Speisezimmer" would be more precise. "Essensjacke" (eating jacket) incorrectly translates "dinner jacket", which refers to a "Smoking" in German, an important distinction emphasized by the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
fabulously → wunderbar → herrlich  	out of touch → vom Tisch → realitätsfremd  		**Explanation:** 	- "wunderbar" (wonderful) is used instead of "fabulously", which matches more closely with "herrlich" (wonderfully), but could be translated as either. Given both carry a similar connotation, "wunderbar" is marked based on preference for the more contextually accurate "herrlich".  	- "vom Tisch" (off the table) is a mistranslation of "out of touch", which should be "realitätsfremd" (out of touch with reality). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "off the table" is not relevant to describing someone's disconnected state of mind.
(→ hatte → hätte)  	(may → mag → hätte)  	(encouraged → ermutigt → aufgefordert)  	(example → Beispiel → Exempel)  		**Explanation:**  	- The word "hatte" should match the conditional tense "hätte" from the reference, this error links to the proper verb form needed for the hypothetical statement.  	- "Mag" (may) doesn't properly express the subjunctive mood "hätte", which fits better with conditional meaning.	- "Ermutigt" (encouraged) is a related word but not identical to "aufgefordert" (urged/requested) in this context, where a stronger sense of urging is needed.  	- The candidate used "Beispiel" (example) instead of "Exempel" (example as in set an example or precedent), which is a different nuance in this context.
housekeeper → Haushaltspersonals → Haushälterin  	flavor → Flackfleisch → Geschmacksrichtungen  		**Explanation:** "Haushaltspersonals" (household staff) is a mistranslation of "housekeeper", which changes the role being discussed. "Flackfleisch" (a non-existent term, possibly a garbled or incorrect word) is meant to translate "flavor", which significantly changes the meaning as it shifts the focus from taste to an unrelated concept. Both errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because they disrupt the intended meaning by either using an incorrect term or a non-existent one.
Depression-era → Depressionszeit → der Großen Depression  	food ways → Nahrungsmittelwege → Arten mit Essen umzugehen  		**Explanation:** "Depression-era" is best translated in this context as "der Großen Depression" as it specifies a distinct historical period, unlike "Depressionszeit". "food ways" is not accurately captured by "Nahrungsmittelwege". The reference uses "Arten mit Essen umzugehen" to convey the idea of methods or habits related to food, which is more precise.
calories → Kalorien → Nahrung  	cooking → Kochen → Nahrungsmittel  		**Explanation:** "Kalorien" (calories) is incorrect because it should match "Nahrung" (nutrition/food) in the reference. "Kochen" (cooking) does not adequately convey the broader concept implied by "Nahrungsmittel" (food items/nourishment) as used in the reference. These mistranslations significantly alter the intended message, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
said → sagte → gab an  	writing → schriftlich → beim Schreiben  	gained → gewonnen → verstanden  	Ms. Ziegelman's mother → Mutter von M. Ziegelman → Ziegelmans Schwiegermutter  		**Explanation:**  	1. "said" is more accurately translated as "gab an" rather than "sagte" in this context, which captures the action of reporting or stating formally.	2. "writing" has been translated to "schriftlich" (in writing), which misses the nuanced context of the book-writing process captured by "beim Schreiben".	3. "gained" translated as "gewonnen" differs from the reference "verstanden" (understood), and it alters the perception of the depth of comprehension.	4. "Ms. Ziegelman's mother" is translated as "Mutter von M. Ziegelman" but "Ziegelmans Schwiegermutter" (Ziegelman's mother-in-law) changes the familial relation, which is a contextually significant error.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. "Lebensmittelabfällen" (food waste) effectively captures the concept of "the waste of food" even though it slightly deviates from the reference ("Verschwendung von Lebensmitteln" also meaning "waste of food"). However, this variation maintains the intended meaning, thus adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** guideline.
recalled → erinnerte → erinnerte sich  	actually → [missing] → tatsächlich  	got → erkrankte → machte  		**Explanation:** "erinnerte" (reminded) is a mistranslation of "recalled", lacking the reflexive part "sich", which is necessary here for proper meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "actually" is missing in the candidate sentence, which changes the intended emphasis, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. The verb "erkrankte" (became ill) is incorrect for "got", as the intended meaning was to make others ill, not the subject themselves, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
cream-puff → Schampfunfall → Windbeutel  		**Explanation:** "Schampfunfall" is a mistranslation of "cream-puff". The correct German word for "cream-puff" in this context is "Windbeutel", as it refers to a specific type of incident. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Schampfunfall" does not convey the intended meaning of "cream-puff incident".
plates → Teller → Teller	cleared → geräumt → abgeräumt	desert → Wüste → Dessert	prune → prine → Pflaumen	ate → versaß → aß		**Explanation:** 	- "geräumt" instead of "abgeräumt" significantly alters the action of clearing dishes specifically in a dining context, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Wüste" is a mistranslation of "dessert," as the word means "desert" and not a sweet dish, violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by picking the most significant word.	- "prine" does not correspond to any meaningful word and should be "Pflaumen," making this an error under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "versaß" is a mistranslation of "ate," leading to a different action, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
prune → pune → Prune  	whip → pip → Whip  	that → der → dass  	snazzy → faulen → schicken  		**Explanation:**  	- "pune" and "pip" are mistranslations of "prune" and "whip," respectively, due to incorrect handling of the title. These errors change the meaning of the title, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "der" (the) is a mistranslation of "that," which changes the grammatical flow of the sentence. This violates the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule because "der" creates a gender discrepancy and confusion.	- "faulen" (lazy) is a mistranslation of "snazzy," which changes the intended compliment to something negative. This is a significant change in meaning, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
whipped → gepanzerte → geschlagene  	cream → Creme → Sahne  	prunes → Tropfen → Pflaumen  	cinnamon → Zinnamon → Zimt  		**Explanation:** "gepanzerte" (armored) is a mistranslation of "whipped". "Creme" can mean cream in context, but together "gepanzerte Creme" is incorrect for "whipped cream". "Tropfen" (drops) is an incorrect translation for "prunes". "Zinnamon" is a spelling variation of "cinnamon" but the correct German translation is "Zimt". Each of these errors significantly impacts the intended meaning, which follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
reluctantly → widerstrebend → widerwillig  	spoon → Spott → Löffel  	viscous → blauäugige → zähen  	goo → Braungogo → Glibber  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation contains several errors:	- "widerstrebend" is a less accurate translation of "reluctantly" than "widerwillig", as it may not fit the intended strength of reluctance in this context.	- "Spott" is a mistranslation of "spoon", which should be "Löffel".	- "blauäugige" (blue-eyed) is a mistranslation of "viscous", which should be "zähen".	- "Braungogo" is a nonsensical mistranslation of "goo", which should be "Glibber". These changes significantly alter the meaning, violating several key aspects of the task instructions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The words "Überraschenderweise" and "Erstaunlicherweise" are acceptable translations of "Surprisingly." The word "war" is a valid translation of "was." Even though the reference translation uses "schmeckte" (tasted), the main meaning of "it wasn't bad" is maintained with "war es nicht schlecht" (it was not bad), thus following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
seconds → Sekunden → Nachschlag  	thirds → Drittel → (dreimal) Nachschlag  		**Explanation:** "Sekunden" (seconds) is a temporal noun, not related to having additional servings, which is the intended meaning of "seconds" in this context. "Drittel" (thirds) is mistranslated and does not refer to an additional round of servings in this sentence; in reference, it's part of the expression indicating multiple servings or times of returning for more. Both mistranslations violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as they do not fit the culinary context denoted by "back for seconds, and thirds."
can-do → Kanonenhaushalter → Can-Do-Budgetierer  	chopped → gekoppelte → gehackte  	walnuts → Nüsse → Walnüsse  		**Explanation:** "Kanonenhaushalter" is a mistranslation of "can-do budgeter". It doesn't convey the intended meaning of someone being optimistic and capable. "Gekoppelte" (coupled) is incorrect in the context where "chopped" is needed, altering the preparation method significantly. "Nüsse" (nuts) is less specific than "walnuts", which changes the specificity of the ingredient.
hero → Helden → Held  		**Explanation:** "Helden" (heroes) is the plural form and incorrect in this context, as the source uses "hero" (singular) and this word choice changes the meaning of the sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it significantly alters the subject of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The phrase "put his own life at risk" is translated as "riskierte sein eigenes Leben," which conveys the intended meaning accurately. The candidate translation maintains the correct meaning and context, fulfilling the rules for **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**. "Setzte sein eigenes Leben aufs Spiel" and "riskierte sein eigenes Leben" are both appropriate translations in this context.
hero → Helden → Held  		**Explanation:** "Helden" is the plural form of "hero" (heroes), which does not match the singular "hero" used in the source sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the reference uses "Held" which means a single hero, maintaining the singular context given in the source sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both the candidate translation "das Leben anderer zu retten" and the reference translation "Anderen das Leben zu retten" convey the same meaning: saving other people's lives. The difference is in structure but not in meaning, and thus, there are no significant errors to report based on the provided instructions.
killed → Opfer → gestorben		**Explanation:** "Opfer" (victim) changes the meaning away from the source word "killed" ("gestorben"), which focuses on the act of dying rather than the status of being a victim. This error reflects the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since the focus on being a victim rather than the act of being killed shifts the intended narrative of the sentence.
White Helmets → Weißhelms-Gruppe → White Helmets  	civil protection → Katastrophenschutzgruppe → Zivilschutzgruppe  	Bild → Zeitungszeitung → Bild-Zeitung  		**Explanation:**  		1. "White Helmets" is a proper noun and should remain untranslated in this context. Translating it to "Weißhelms-Gruppe" changes the proper noun, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "civil protection" should be translated as "Zivilschutzgruppe", not as "Katastrophenschutzgruppe", as the latter implies a focus on disaster protection specifically, which can alter the intended scope of protection.	3. "Bild" is a specific newspaper name and should be accurately translated as "Bild-Zeitung". The candidate used "Zeitungszeitung" (literally meaning newspaper newspaper), which is nonsensical in place of the proper noun, thereby violating **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule for maintaining correct references.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While there are slight differences between the candidate and reference translations, such as "riskieren ihr Leben" vs. "setzen ihr eigenes Leben aufs Spiel" and "bombardierten Häusern" vs. "zerbombten Häusern," these variations do not significantly change the meaning of the sentence. The translations are contextually accurate and acceptable alternatives in German, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Hence, no errors are reported.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The candidate translation matches the reference translation perfectly. All words correctly represent the source sentence, ensuring adherence to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, confirming the translation's accuracy without meaningful errors.
civil protection volunteer → Zivilschutzbeauftragten → Zivilschützers  	showing → zeigte → zeigt  	infant → Kleinkinds → Säuglings  	ruins → Ruinen → Trümmern  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Zivilschutzbeauftragten" (civil protection officer) is a mistranslation for "civil protection volunteer", which is more accurately translated as "Zivilschützers". This meets the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "zeigte" (showed) is past tense, whereas the source intent is present continuous, as shown by "zeigt", which fits the context provided by "went viral". This follows both the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.	3. "Kleinkinds" (toddler) is a mistranslation of "infant", which aligns better with "Säuglings". This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it alters the specific age and development level of the child being described.	4. "Ruinen" (ruins) while similar, does not convey the same meaning in this context as "Trümmern" (debris/rubble), as the reference implies more immediate remnants of destruction. This complies with the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
Syrian → Syrien → Syrer  	glowing → erbarmungslosen → leuchtenden  	figurehead → Zahlenvertreter → Symbolfigur  		**Explanation:** "Syrien" (Syria) is a mistranslation of "Syrian" (Syrer), which changes the subject of the sentence. "Erbarmungslosen" (ruthless) is a mistranslation of "glowing" (leuchtenden), altering the nature of the description. "Zahlenvertreter" (number representative) is a mistranslation of "figurehead" (Symbolfigur), which misrepresents the original concept.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. Although minor differences exist in structure and word choice between the candidate and reference translations, such as "Held" instead of "Helden" or the omitted "laut Bild," they do not significantly change the meaning. Therefore, according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, no translation errors are detected.
lives → würde → Leben  	saw → sah → sieht  		**Explanation:** "würde" (would) does not account for the act of "saving lives" as meant in the source. The candidate translation lacks this meaning, deviating significantly from the intended message. The word "sah" (saw) conveys a past tense perspective, whereas "sieht" (sees) aligns with the source's hypothetical nature of being viewed as a martyr, affecting the sentence's temporal accuracy.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence. While there are differences in wording compared to the reference translation, such as "Opfer eines Anschlags" versus "einem Angriff zum Opfer fiel" and "jüngsten Bombenanschläge auf Syrien" versus "letzten Bombenangriffe in Syrien," these do not significantly change the meaning and can be considered acceptable variations. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
barrel bombs → Barrel-Bomben → Fassbomben  	released → freigegeben → abgeworfen  		**Explanation:** "Barrel-Bomben" is a mistranslation of "barrel bombs" as the more appropriate term in German is "Fassbomben," which directly corresponds to the translation used in the reference. This error is significant as it pertains to a specific type of weapon. Additionally, "freigegeben" (released) is a mistranslation of "abgeworfen" (dropped). "Freigegeben" implies "released" in a sense that does not fit the context of deploying bombs, which should instead be captured by "abgeworfen," indicating they were dropped.
killed → getötet → starben  	difficulties → behaftet → leiden  	breathing → Atemschwierigkeiten → Atemnot  		**Explanation:** "getötet" (killed) is more direct than "starben" (died) but given the context, it's a significant mistranslation as "starben" aligns better with the source wording. "behaftet" (afflicted) does somewhat convey "difficulties" but "leiden" (suffer) is a more suitable choice for describing a medical difficulty. Additionally, "Atemschwierigkeiten" (breathing difficulties) is translated as "Atemnot" (shortness of breath), which better captures the notion of medical distress described in the reference.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the reference translation and conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence effectively. The variations between "räumen ... ab" and "beseitigen" are stylistic but do not lead to a significant change in meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. No single-word translation errors significantly impacting meaning are present, thus following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Every significant word within the candidate translation matches the intended meaning from the source sentence and the reference translation. "Tödliche" for "fatal", "Bombe" for "bomb", "des Assad-Regimes" for "dropped by the Assad regime", and the overall structure related to "aiming" or "being supposed to" in the context of targeting terrorists is preserved. Thereby, this follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule and maintains the intended significance, resulting in no significant translation errors.
Wirbelfärbe → Wirbeltier  		**Explanation:** "Wirbelfärbe" is a mistranslation of "vertebrate", which is "Wirbeltier" in German. The error changes the meaning because "Wirbelfärbe" does not have a contextual or lexical relevance to "vertebrate", violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
rare → Blick → Anblick		**Explanation:** "Blick" (glance) is a mistranslation of "sight", which should be "Anblick" in the context of a "rare sight". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the meaning is altered.
Greenland → Grönische → Grönland  	only → erst → nur  		**Explanation:** "Grönische" is not the correct translation of "Greenland", which in this context should be "Grönland". This error impacts the meaning by inaccurately identifying the type of shark. "Erst" implies a delay, unlike "only", which indicates restriction. Using "nur" maintains the original context that the sharks surface only during winter.
examined → Prüfung → Untersuchung  		**Explanation:** "Prüfung" (examining or testing) does not accurately translate "examined" in this context because it omits the notion of it being an action performed on the shark, leading to a change in sentence focus. "Untersuchung" directly aligns with the intended examination of the shark.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both the candidate translation and the reference translation effectively convey the meaning of the source sentence. The word choices, such as "schwommen" (swum) and "schwimmt" (swims), although slightly different, do not significantly change the meaning and are both appropriate in context. Thus, no significant single-word errors can be identified.
sharks → Haie → Grönlandhaie  	young → Menschen → Nachwuchs  		**Explanation:** "Haie" (sharks) is a partial translation that omits the specific type of shark, "Grönlandhaie" (Greenland sharks). "Menschen" (people) is an incorrect translation of "young", which should be "Nachwuchs" (offspring in a general sense). The mistranslation of "young" significantly alters the meaning, as it implies the birth of humans rather than shark offspring.
Greenland sharks → Grönland → Grönlandhai  	leisurely → rasch → gemächlich  		**Explanation:** "Grönland" (Greenland) is incorrectly used for "Greenland sharks", which should be "Grönlandhai". This is a significant translation error as it changes the subject of the sentence from the sharks to the island. Similarly, "rasch" (quickly) is a mistranslation of "leisurely", significantly altering the meaning of the sharks' swimming behavior. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
necessary → erforderlich → drauf ankommt   	ramp → ausfüllen → beschleunigt  	seal → Robben → Robbe  		**Explanation:** 		1. "erforderlich" (required) is a mistranslation of "necessary". The phrase "drauf ankommt" (comes down to it) captures the conditional aspect more aptly, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.		2. "ausfüllen" (fill out) is a mistranslation of "ramp up," which means to increase speed. "beschleunigt" (accelerates) fits the context of increasing speed, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		3. "Robben" (seals) is a mistranslation of "seal" in singular form, affecting the comparison's accuracy. "Robbe" (seal) provides the correct singular reference, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Diese Langsamkeit des Lebens scheint jedoch der Schlüssel zu einem langen Leben zu sein." captures the main meaning of the source sentence "this slow pace of life seems to be the key to a long life." Although it is not a direct word-for-word translation of the reference sentence, it does not contain significant errors that drastically alter the meaning or intent of the original sentence. Both "Langsamkeit des Lebens" and "von Langsamkeit geprägte Lebensstil" convey the idea of a slow pace of life, and both "Schlüssel zu einem langen Leben" and "Patentrezept für ein hohes Alter" suggest something critical to achieving longevity.
Fachzeitschrift → Fachzeitschrift, → Fachzeitschrift  	Grönlandhai → Grönlandhai → Grönlandhai		**Explanation:** The phrase "Fachzeitschrift," (specialist journal) is not correctly enclosed within the commas in the candidate translation, which confuses the structure. Additionally, "Grönlandhai" (Greenland shark) in the candidate sentence lacks the appropriate article and ending as "Grönlandhai" needs to be in accusative form with "einem" in the correct context provided by the reference. However, considering single-word errors, only the incorrect punctuation is a significant factor. Since the sentence still identifies the shark as a singular noun, it’s crucial to address that punctuation error.
Alexander Scheulelin → Scheulelin → Scheuerlein  	Research → Research → demografische  	Lebensdauer → Lebensdauer → Lebensspanne  	Weltrekorde → Weltrekorde → Weltrekord  	Wirbeltaten → Wirbeltaten → Wirbeltiere  		**Explanation:**  	- "Scheulelin" is a mistranslation of "Scheuerlein", impacting the name identification.  	- "Research" should be translated to "demografische" in this context to match "demographic research"; just "Research" omits the demographic aspect.  	- "Lebensdauer" (life duration) differs from "Lebensspanne" (lifespan), which is the intended meaning.  	- "Weltrekorde" (world records) is a pluralization error when the singular "Weltrekord" (world record) is needed.  	- "Wirbeltaten" (vertebrate deeds) is incorrect and should be "Wirbeltiere" (vertebrates) to maintain the meaning related to animals rather than actions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the meaning of the source sentence, even though the phrasing differs slightly from the reference translation. Both the candidate and reference capture the core concepts: evolutionary biologists having thought for a long time and the context of Greenland sharks. Thus, no significant single-word mistranslations violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** or **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In this case, "simply lacking" and "hatten einfach keine" can be interpreted similarly in terms of lacking proof. "Beweise" fits well contextually as "proof," and both translations convey the message of a lack of evidence. Hence, there are no significant mistranslations, fulfilling the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
Greenland → Grönische → Grönland  	ocean → Eismeer → Ozean  		**Explanation:**  	- "Grönische" is a mistranslation of "Greenland" and should be "Grönland" in reference to the specific species of shark. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "ocean" is incorrectly translated to not preserve the contextual specificity of "Eismeer" (Arctic Ocean or similar cold waters), affecting the geographic context and meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence maintains the general meaning and context of the source and reference sentences, effectively conveying the idea that the subjects usually come to the surface in winter due to their preference for certain water temperatures. There are no significant single-word errors altering the intended message, in line with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation adequately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, despite structural differences. "Leben grönländischer Haie" (life of Greenland sharks) and "Lebensstil der Grönlandhaie" (lifestyle of the Greenland sharks) both reflect the source idea that researchers know little about how Greenland sharks live. Therefore, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no single-word translation errors are identified.
speed → Langsamkeit → Zeitlupentempo  	researchers → Forschern → sie  	off → vor → vor  	Svalbard → Svalard → Spitzbergen  	tracker → Fahrern → Sender  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Langsamkeit" (slowness) is a mistranslation of "speed." The reference uses "Zeitlupentempo" (literally "slow-motion speed"), preserving the original meaning of slowness in motion.	2. "Forschern" (researchers) is used in a passive construction that distorts the original sentence's structure and role of the agents, while the reference implies the researchers are the ones doing the action ("sie" - "they").	3. "Vor" (before or in front of) is correctly used in both translations; however, its correctness must be assessed in terms of styling rather than distinguishing between synonyms or valid syntax.	4. "Svalard" appears to be a misspelling of "Svalbard," whereas "Spitzbergen" is an alternative name for the location, making the misspelling factually incorrect.	5. "Fahrern" (drivers) is a mistranslation of "tracker." The correct term is "Sender" (transmitter or tracker), which fits the context of animal tracking.
seal → Robbens → Robbe		jawbone → Jawbogen → Kieferknochen		**Explanation:** "Robbens" is an incorrect form of "seal" in this context, where "Robbe" is correct. "Jawbogen" is not the correct translation for "jawbone"; the appropriate word is "Kieferknochen," as the latter fits the anatomical context required. Both errors significantly alter the meaning, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
hunting → jagen → patrouillieren  	sleeping animals → Schlaftiere → schlafende Tiere  	patrol → Patrouillen → patrouillieren  	corpses → Leichen → Kadaver  		**Explanation:**  	1. "hunting" is an activity that involves "patrouillieren" (to patrol) and what they actually do is "patrouillieren" (to patrol), hence the word "Patrouillen" is misused as a noun. This needs to be translated as "patrouillieren".	2. "sleeping animals" is mistranslated as "Schlaftiere" which is incorrect in German; the correct term is "schlafende Tiere".	3. "patrol" in the source refers to an action, whereas "Patrouillen" is treated incorrectly as a noun in the candidate.	4. "corpses" should be translated as "Kadaver," as "Leichen" carries a different connotation.
Greenland sharks → grönländische Haie → Grönlandhaie  	caught → gefangen → als Beifang aus der Tiefe des Nordatlantiks holten  		**Explanation:** "grönländische Haie" is a mistranslation of "Greenland sharks." The term used in reference, "Grönlandhaie," is the correct specific term for the species. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule to use the correct species name. The word "gefangen" (caught) doesn't capture the meaning of "als Beifang aus der Tiefe des Nordatlantiks holten" (brought up as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic), which is more precise. Although multi-word, the key error is "gefangen" differing in meaning for how they were caught.
largest → größten → größte		**Explanation:** "größten" (plural, largest) is a mistranslation of "largest" (singular), requiring "größte" to maintain singular agreement with the subject "shark". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the source specifies one largest shark, not multiple, significantly changing the meaning.
carbon-14 → Kohlenwasserstoff 14 → Kohlenstoff-14  	lens core → Hakenkreis → Linsenkern  	shark's age → Haifischalter → Alter der Haie  		**Explanation:**  	- "Kohlenwasserstoff 14" (hydrocarbon 14) is a mistranslation of "carbon-14," which should be translated as "Kohlenstoff-14." This significantly changes the meaning of the method used for dating.	- "Hakenkreis" (hook circle) is a mistranslation of "lens core," which should be "Linsenkern." "Hakenkreis" is nonsensical in this context.	- "Haifischalter" (shark's switch) is a mistranslation of "shark's age," which should be "Alter der Haie." The phrase used in the candidate translation alters the intended meaning of age determination.
1. core → Kern → Zentrum  	**Explanation:** "Kern" translates to "core", but in the context of a component like the eye's lens, "Zentrum" is more appropriate, as per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		2. eye's lens → Augenblicks → Augenlinse  	**Explanation:** "Augenblicks" translates to "moment", which does not relate to the "eye's lens" at all. "Augenlinse" correctly represents the intended meaning, violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.		3. shark → Hais → Haie  	**Explanation:** "Hais" is the genitive singular form of "shark", but the reference implies multiple sharks, therefore "Haie" (plural nominative) is used. This affects the overall plurality intended, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		4. proteins → Proteine in diesem Hai → die darin enthaltenen Proteine  	**Explanation:** The phrase "Proteine in diesem Hai" (proteins in this shark) is incorrect as it implies the location of proteins in the shark rather than the lens. The correct phrase is "die darin enthaltenen Proteine" (the proteins contained therein) as per the reference sentence, thus emphasizing the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules.
carbon-14 → CO2-14 → Kohlenstoff-14  	lens cores → Liegenschildern → Linsenkern  		**Explanation:** "CO2-14" (which implies a non-existent form of carbon dioxide) is a mistranslation of "carbon-14", which significantly changes the scientific context of the sentence. "Liegenschildern" is not a correct translation for "lens cores" and changes the intended anatomical reference. "Linsenkern" is the accurate term, as used in the reference sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. "Wahrscheinlich" (likely) and "vorzeitig" (consequently/therefore) are correctly rendered contextually, and "freisetzten" (released) is a suitable alternative for "schleuderten" (threw/released) in this context. Therefore, according to the instructions, there are no significant single-word translation errors present.
lens cores → Leitungslinien → Linsenkern  	third-smallest → drittkleinstem → drittkleinsten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Leitungslinien" (lines or conduit lines) is a mistranslation of "lens cores," which significantly alters the intended meaning of the sentence. "Linsenkern" refers specifically to the core of a lens, fitting the original context related to anatomy or biology.	2. "Drittkleinstem" means "third-smallest" in a grammatically incorrect form compared to the context. The correct form "drittkleinsten" maintains the grammatical structure and aligns with the reference translation contextually.
contrast → Dagegen → dagegen  	lens → Lenkungszentren → Linsenkern  	carbon-14 → Kohlenwasserstoff-14 → Kohlenstoff-14  		**Explanation:**  	- "Dagegen" (however) is used at the beginning of the candidate sentence but should match "By contrast," which is better reflected as "dagegen" when comparing different parts of the information.	- "Lenkungszentren" (steering centers) is a mistranslation of "lens cores," which should be "Linsenkern," as the intended meaning is related to the anatomy of the sharks, not steering mechanisms.	- "Kohlenwasserstoff-14" (hydrocarbon-14) is incorrect for "carbon-14," which should be "Kohlenstoff-14," as this is a specific isotope of carbon, not hydrocarbons.
carbon-14 → Kohlendioxid-14 → Kohlenstoff-14  	monitor → Überwacher → Uhr  	Greenland shark → Plattenhai → Grönlandhai  		**Explanation:**  	- "Kohlendioxid-14" translates to "carbon dioxide-14", which is incorrect. The correct term is "Kohlenstoff-14", as used in carbon dating, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Überwacher" means "supervisor" or "watcher", while "Uhr" (clock) is the correct context for a measuring instrument like a monitor, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "Plattenhai" translates to "plank shark," which is incorrect for "Greenland shark." "Grönlandhai" is the correct term, as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.		
female → grönländische → Grönlandhai-Weibchen
length → Länge → der Länge  	age → hohe Alter → ein Alter  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Länge" in the candidate sentence is contextually somewhat awkward but not entirely incorrect. However, when prepositions and structure modify its role in the sentence, it becomes more complex. "der Länge" (the length) from the reference keeps the structure close to the source meaning. However, given that the candidate only subtly errs in exact phrasing, it's more about supporting context than direct translation error.		2. "hohe Alter" (a high age) significantly alters the meaning. The source and reference suggest mapping length to age inherently, not to a specific attribute of age like "hohe". The critical word "Alter" aligns correctly with reference, so its qualification with "hohe" in the candidate makes "Alter" the focus for a mistranslation error, as it improperly extends the meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence accurately conveys the source sentence's meaning in German, with acceptable variations consistent with the reference translation. The translations of key concepts such as the animal's length, sexual maturity, and time needed for reproduction are coherent within the context of the provided text. Hence, abiding by the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no translation errors are reported.
world → weltweiter → Welt  		**Explanation:** "weltweiter" means "worldwide", which changes the meaning when compared to "world", the intended translation. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it incorrectly suggests a global occurrence rather than a world record.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence. "Eisgewässern" (icy waters) and "eisigen Gewässern" (icy waters) convey the same meaning. The structure differs, but the key words and their meanings remain intact, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
previous → frühere → bisherige  	record → Rekordinhaber → Rekordhalter  	211 → 21 → 211  	Greenland → grönländischer → Grönland  	harpoon → Hafentip → Harpunenspitze  	caught → erwischt → gefangen  		**Explanation:** 		- "frühere" (former) is a mistranslation of "previous", which in this context is better captured by "bisherige" (prior).	- "Rekordinhaber" (record owner) deviates from "record holder", which in context is "Rekordhalter".	- "21" is a clear numerical mistranslation of "211".	- "grönländischer" (Greenlandish) instead of "Grönland" (Greenland) does change the noun describing the whale species, disrupting the specific identification.	- "Hafentip" (harbor tip) instead of "Harpunenspitze" (harpoon tip) shifts the meaning entirely.	- "erwischt" (caught, as in detected) does not fit the context as well as "gefangen" (captured physically).
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. Phrases such as "laufen die Systeme der dort lebenden Tiere oft mit so wenig Energie wie möglich" are equivalent to "läuft häufig auch der Organismus der dort lebenden Tiere auf Sparflamme," capturing both the essence and the meaning of the source sentence correctly. Thus, no significant single-word translation errors are identified.
mature → alt → altern		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "alt sind" (are old) instead of "altern" (age), which is a significant misrepresentation of the phrase "age slower". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as "alt sind" implies a state of being old rather than the process of aging.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the meaning of the original source sentence accurately by maintaining the emphasis on the animals becoming large to stay warm in cold waters. There are no single-word translation errors that significantly alter the intended meaning.
volume → Volumen → Volumen  	surface → Oberflächenfläche → Oberfläche  	radiates → strahlt → einbüßt  		**Explanation:** "Volumen" is correctly translated, so it is not listed. However, "Oberflächenfläche" (surface area) is repetitive and incorrect in this context compared to the reference "Oberfläche" (surface), which is the more appropriate term. Additionally, "strahlt" (radiates) is a mistranslation of "loses" in terms of heat usage, which is signified by "einbüßt" in the reference. However, "strahlen" is close to "radiate," so it might pass in different contexts, but here "einbüßt" holds the accurate notion of heat loss.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The differences in structure between the candidate and the reference translation do not result in any significant change in meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The phrase "Ein weiterer Vorteil ist, dass sie weniger Feinde haben." effectively communicates "Another advantage is that they have fewer enemies." There are no significant single-word translation errors when comparing it to the reference. The differences in structure ("ist, dass sie" versus ":", "haben" versus "haben") do not significantly affect the meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Scheuerlein → Scheuelin → Scheuerlein  	evolutionary → evolutionärer → Evolutionsbiologe		**Explanation:**  	1. "Scheuerlein" has been mistranslated as "Scheuelin". This is likely a typo, as it refers to a proper name.	2. "evolutionärer" (evolutionary) is used instead of "Evolutionsbiologe" (evolutionary biologist), which is a more specific term. In this context, while "evolutionärer Biologe" is technically not incorrect, the reference provides a more precise translation by using the full term "Evolutionsbiologe," which maintains uniformity with the proper noun usage.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation aligns well with the reference translation in terms of meaning. While the structures and some word choices differ (e.g., "kann" vs. "sollte"), these variations do not constitute mistranslations when considering context and acceptable translation variations. This aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
twinpack → Teppich → Doppelpack  		**Explanation:** "Teppich" (carpet) is a mistranslation of "twinpack" (Doppelpack), which significantly alters the intended meaning of the sentence. This is a clear case of mistranslation that violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
commune's council → Rat → Gemeinderat		**Explanation:** The word "Rat" refers to "council" but does not specify "commune's council," which is translated as "Gemeinderat" in the reference. This does not align with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the specific type of council is essential to the meaning.
mayor → Bürgermeisters → Bürgermeister  	committee → Ausschuss → Gremium  	announcement → Ankündigung → Mitteilung  	residential → Wohngebäude → Wohnbauflächen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Bürgermeisters" (possessive form of mayor) and "Bürgermeister" are synonymous, both meaning "mayor," so there is no error here.	- "Ausschuss" (committee) is a synonym for "Gremium", a council or body, but given the context of formal and relieved acceptance suggested by "Erleichterung", "Gremium" fits better.	- "Ankündigung" (announcement) and "Mitteilung" are synonymous for "announcement," but given the context where it conveys a message, "Mitteilung" fits better with relief.	- "Wohngebäude" (residential buildings) does not capture the idea of "sites" or "lands" meant by "Wohnbauflächen", where "sites" suggests an area, not built structures.
plot → Komplott → Grundstücks  	parcelling → Parallelität → Parzellierungs  	accessibility → Zugänglichkeit → Erschließungs  	plots → Teppiche → Grundstücke  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Komplott" translates to "conspiracy," which is a mistranslation of "plot" in this context, where "Grundstücks" (property/land) is the correct term referring to plots of land.  	2. "Parallelität" translates to "parallelism," but "parcelling" refers to the division of land, for which "Parzellierungs" is the correct term.  	3. "Zugänglichkeit" means "accessibility," which might seem accurate, but within the context of real estate development, "Erschließungs" (development) more closely aligns with the intended meaning.  	4. "Teppiche" translates to "carpets," which is an incorrect translation for "plots" of land, where "Grundstücke" is appropriate.
construction sites → Baustellen → Bauflächen  	residential commune → Heimat → Wohngemeinde  		**Explanation:** "Baustellen" (construction sites) is a mistranslation of "Bauflächen" (plot areas), changing the intended nuance of land available for construction versus active construction sites. "Heimat" (home) is a mistranslation of "Wohngemeinde" (residential commune), altering the context of the location being referred to as a living community rather than a generalized notion of home. These errors fall under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, as they alter the intended message of the sentence.
people → die Menschen → Bauwillige  	apply → gelten → melden  	sites → Stätten → Parzellen  	plots → Plattformen → Parzellen  		**Explanation:** 	- "die Menschen" (the people) is a less specific translation than "Bauwillige" (those willing to build), which is more contextually accurate.	- "gelten" (be valid) is an incorrect translation of "apply" in this context, where "melden" (to register or report) is the intended action.	- "Stätten" (places) does not convey the specific meaning of "sites" for building; "Parzellen" (plots) is more accurate.	- "Plattformen" (platforms) is a mistranslation of "plots" referring to parcels of land ("Parzellen").
movement → Verbringung → Ansiedelung  	businesses → Unternehmen → Gewerbebetriebe  	space → Weltraums → Flächennutzungsplan  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Verbringung" translates to "transfer" or "relocation," while "Ansiedelung" is more about "settlement" or "establishment," which aligns with the intended meaning of "movement" regarding businesses. This is a significant contextual error, per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Unternehmen" means "companies," while "Gewerbebetriebe" refers more specifically to "commercial businesses" or "enterprises," which fits the economic context of "additional businesses." This adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the specificity of the entity described.	3. "Weltraums" means "outer space," which is inaccurate when referring to "Flächennutzungsplan," meaning "land use plan" in the context of the sentence. This error follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it dramatically alters the sentence's meaning.
business area → Geschäftsbereich → Gewerbegebiet  	marked out → ausgezeichnete → ausgewiesene  	plots → Teppiche → Parzellen  		**Explanation:** "Geschäftsbereich" (business sector) is a mistranslation of "business area," where "Gewerbegebiet" (commercial area or zone) better fits the intended meaning. "ausgezeichnete" (excellent) is contextually incorrect for "marked out," where "ausgewiesene" (designated) captures the intended designation of the area. "Teppiche" (carpets) is a mistranslation of "plots," as in "land plots," which is better represented by "Parzellen" (land parcels or plots). These errors all significantly change the meaning of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Frankfurt wird von Brexit profitieren" conveys the same meaning as the source sentence and the reference translation. The differences in the structure ("wird profitieren" vs. "profitiert") do not affect the translation accuracy or the intended meaning. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon comparing the candidate and reference translations, there is no significant change in meaning that violates any rules. All elements in the candidate translation accurately reflect the source sentence's key concepts and do not introduce incorrect terms. Although there might be slight differences in phrasing, they do not alter the essential meaning, complying with the **Acceptable Variations** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
likely → wahrscheinlich → wahrscheinlich  	Head → Chef → Leiter  	specialist area → Fachgebiet → Kompetenzfeld  		**Explanation:**  	- "höchstwahrscheinlich" is nearly synonymous with "sehr wahrscheinlich", and since this does not significantly change the meaning, it is not listed as an error.	- "Chef" (chief) is a mistranslation of "Head", as "Leiter" (leader or head) is a more contextually appropriate term in this setting.	- "Fachgebiet" is a literal translation of "specialist area", but when compared with the reference's "Kompetenzfeld", it alters the nuance slightly. However, this difference is not stark enough to change the overall sentence meaning in a substantial way, thus "Fachgebiet" is listed considering the context of business and management terminology.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The words used, although different from the reference translation, maintain the intended meaning. The differences such as "Finanzinstitutionen" vs. "Geldhäuser" and "europäische Finanzgeschäfte" vs. "Finanzgeschäfte in der gesamten EU" are not significant enough to change the meaning of the sentence. Thus, according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, there are no mistranslations to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The variations in sentence structure and word choice between the candidate and reference ("Registrierung" vs. "Zulassung", "Vereinigten Königreich" vs. "Großbritannien", "gefordert" vs. "reicht") are all acceptable synonyms or rephrasings that maintain the original sentence's meaning, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Thus, no significant translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Dies wird von den großen US-Banken generell genutzt." captures the meaning of the source sentence and aligns well with the reference translation. Although there are slight variances in wording (e.g., "generell genutzt" vs. "nutzen gerade"), these do not constitute significant translation errors as both convey the intended meaning of general usage by large US banks, complying with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence. Both "bereits" and "schon" can be used for "already," and "Arbeitsplätze" covers the meaning of "jobs" in this context. There are no significant changes in meaning following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, and it adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as the variations do not alter the intended message.
expects → erwartet → rechnet  	on → im → am  		**Explanation:**  	- "erwartet" (expects) is a possible translation but does not capture the nuance of "rechnet" (reckons) in the same way as the reference translation, which suggests a slightly stronger analytical basis or probability. Given the context of predictions by a group, the reference is preferred, but this falls into a grey area where both are technically acceptable. 	- "im" (in the) is a mistranslation of "on" when referring to geographic location on the river. The correct preposition for location "on the river Main" is "am" in German, meaning "on" or "at", which correctly refers to the geographic area along the river rather than inside the river itself, which "im" would imply and is contextually incorrect.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the source sentence, capturing the meaning that Frankfurt benefits from being a hub for significant financial and regulatory institutions. Despite slight differences in wording from the reference translation, none of the candidate words significantly alter the intended message. Thus, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, there are no single-word translation errors to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and the reference translation convey the same meaning. Although there are differences in structure and word choice, these do not constitute significant mistranslations of single words. The translation correctly represents the importance of the OECD and the ECB in relation to the financial sector, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
proximity → Nähe → Nähe	central bank → Zentralbank → Notenbank	authorities → Behörden → Aufsicht	IWs → IWs → IW-Professor  		**Explanation:** 		1. **Central Bank:** "Zentralbank" is a synonym for "Notenbank" and both can be used to describe "central bank" in some contexts. However, if there's a specific standard term in German within the context that is "Notenbank," then "Zentralbank" could be considered slightly off. Given that "Notenbank" is more commonly used in such contexts, this is marked as an error here.		2. **Authorities:** "Behörden" is a broader term generally referring to authorities in an administrative sense, while "Aufsicht" specifically means "supervision" and generally aligns with overseeing roles like those from a central bank or financial regulatory authority. In this context, "Aufsicht" provides more precise communication regarding financial oversight and thus is marked as an error.		3. **Name Format (IWs):** The correct format for the title of "IW-Professor" should use a hyphen instead of appending the 's' directly to "IW", ensuring accuracy and consistency with professional titles. 		The word "Nähe" for "proximity" is consistent in both the candidate and reference and therefore not marked as an error.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence correctly conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Both the candidate translation and the reference indicate that Luxembourg has a large funds industry but struggles with infrastructure, similar to Dublin. There are no single-word mistranslations that significantly alter the meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence, while slightly different, accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. "zugänglich" (accessible) and "zu erreichen" (to get to) both imply ease of accessibility due to the large airport. This aligns with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where both expressions are contextually acceptable. While there is a slight difference in expression between "wesentlich" and "deutlich", this does not significantly alter the meaning in this context.
geschäftseigenschaften → Geschäftseigenschaften → Gewerbeimmobilien		**Explanation:** The word "Geschäftseigenschaften" (business properties) should be "Gewerbeimmobilien" to accurately reflect the context of real estate in the reference sentence. "Geschäftseigenschaften" suggests features of a business rather than properties, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules due to the significant change in meaning.
vacant → unbesetzte → freie  		**Explanation:** "unbesetzte" (unoccupied) is a mistranslation of "vacant" in the context of office space. The reference uses "freie" which is a more accurate translation in this context, as it commonly refers to available or vacant spaces.
rents → Renten → Mieten  	business → Geschäfte → Gewerbeimmobilien  		**Explanation:** "Renten" (pensions) is a mistranslation of "rents" and does not fit the context of property rentals, thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Geschäfte" (businesses) is a mistranslation of "business properties", which refers to "Gewerbeimmobilien" (commercial properties) in the reference, changing the meaning in the context of the sentence. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation communicates the same overall meaning as the reference translation. There are some differences in word choice and structure, but they do not significantly alter the intended meaning. The translation maintains accuracy and clarity according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
1. management → Leitungs → Unternehmens  	2. compiled → zusammengestellten → Ranking  	3. 33rd → 333. → 33  		**Explanation:**  	- "Leitungs" (leading) is a mistranslation of "management" and does not convey the meaning of management consultants correctly. The correct translation in this context is "Unternehmens."	- "zusammengestellten" (compiled) is a mistranslation when compared to the reference "Ranking," which suits the context better, as the sentence describes a ranked list rather than a general compilation.	- "333." is a mistranslation of "33rd." The extra digit significantly alters the ranking, which is an error requiring correction to maintain accuracy and intent.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. The variations between "Lebensqualität eine Frage der Präferenz ist" and "Lebensqualität eine Frage der Vorlieben sei", or "starke Position als Finanzknotenpunkt" and "starke Position als Finanzstandort" do not significantly alter the overall meaning. These differences are acceptable variations and do not warrant reporting as translation errors based on the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and aligns with the reference translation. The key elements such as "Brexit-Abstimmung" (Brexit vote), "London", "Finanzkapital" (financial capital), "Europas" (Europe's), and "Wirtschaftsforschern" (economic researchers) are correctly translated and maintain the intended context, fulfilling the task rules.
strength → Stärkungsquoten → Kräfteverhältnisse  		**Explanation:** "Stärkungsquoten" (strengthening quotas) is an incorrect translation for "strength ratios". The reference uses "Kräfteverhältnisse", which accurately conveys "strength ratios" in the context of comparing numbers of people in different locations. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the meaning of the sentence.
attorney → Gebühren → Rechtskosten		**Explanation:** "Gebühren" (fees) is a mistranslation of "attorney fees," as it does not specify legal fees, which are more accurately represented by "Rechtskosten" in this context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Gebühren" does not convey the specific nature of the cost related to legal proceedings.
1. Sciences → Science → Sciences  	2. attorney → Anzeigegebühren → Rechtskosten  	3. drugmaker → Drogenmarker → Pharmaunternehmen  		**Explanation:**		1. "Science" is a mistranslation of "Sciences", which should match in number as per the company name.	2. "Anzeigegebühren" (advertisement fees) is a mistranslation of "attorney fees", which should be "Rechtskosten" (legal costs or attorney fees). This is a significant error altering the meaning of the legal context.	3. "Drogenmarker" is a mistranslation of "drugmaker", which results in nonsensical terminology. The correct German term should be "Pharmaunternehmen" (pharmaceutical company or drugmaker).
Gilead → Gilad → Gilead   	drug → Drogen → Medikamenten  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Gilad" is a mistranslation of "Gilead", likely due to a typographical error or misinterpretation, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it changes the proper noun of the company involved.	2. "Drogen" (drugs) should be "Medikamenten" (medications), as "Drogen" can imply illegal or non-prescription drugs, which changes the connotation and context, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
U.S. District Judge → Bezirksrichter → US-Amtsrichterin  	filing → Akte → Erhebung der Klage  	relief → Entlastung → Erlass  	fees → Gebühren → Kosten  	incurred → entgangenen → entstanden sind  		**Explanation:**  	- "Bezirksrichter" (district judge) does not specify that the judge is from the U.S., which is clarified in the reference as "US-Amtsrichterin" (U.S. district judge). The mistranslation affects contextual accuracy.	- "Akte" (file/document) is not a precise translation of "filing" in this context, where the reference specifies "Erhebung der Klage" (filing of the lawsuit), clarifying the legal context of the source sentence.	- "Entlastung" (relief) does not convey the legal context of "relief" as accurately as "Erlass" (remission), altering the intended context.	- "Gebühren" (fees) vs. "Kosten" (costs): In the legal context described, "Kosten" more accurately encompasses all costs incurred, including fees.	- "entgangenen" (missed) incorrectly conveys the sense of fees not obtained, whereas "entstanden sind" (incurred) reflects that fees were costs that arose during the defense. This changes the meaning significantly.
Gilead → Gilad → Gilead		**Explanation:** "Gilad" is a mistranslation of "Gilead". The name of the company is specific and should remain unchanged. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it alters the proper noun, which affects the accuracy of the information presented.
1. Gilead → Gilad → Gilead	2. sofosbuvir → Softbover → Sofosbuvir	3. drugs → Drogen → Medikamenten		**Explanation:**		1. "Gilad" in the candidate translation is a misspelling of "Gilead," resulting in an identity mistake. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the name is critical for identifying the companies involved.	2. "Softbover" is a mistranslation of "sofosbuvir." The candidate uses a phonetically similar but incorrect word. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, as it incorrectly names the drug.	3. "Drogen" (drugs) changes the meaning from "Medikamente" (medications), as "Drogen" often implies illegal substances and doesn't match the context of pharmaceutical products, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
seized → übernommen → zurückerobert  		**Explanation:** "übernommen" (taken over) does not capture the nuance of "seized", which in the context of regaining control in a conflict situation is more accurately translated as "zurückerobert" (reclaimed or taken back). This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by pinpointing the verb whose translation significantly alters the intended meaning.
Islamic State fighters → islamischen Staatskämpfer → IS-Kämpfer  	left → linken → verlassen  		**Explanation:** "islamischen Staatskämpfer" ("Islamic State fighters") and "IS-Kämpfer" essentially convey the same meaning, so this is not an error based solely on that variation. However, the phrase "in der linken Stadt" where "linken" means "left" is a mistranslation. Instead of indicating that the fighters "left" or "verlassen" the city, it mistakenly modifies the city as "left city," which distorts the intended action and meaning.
Syria Democratic Forces → syrischen Demokratischen Kräfte → Demokratischen Kräfte Syriens	sweeping → überflutet → durchkämmen	militants → Menschen → Kämpfern	holed up → festsitzen → vergraben		**Explanation:**		1. **"Syria Democratic Forces" → "syrischen Demokratischen Kräfte" → "Demokratischen Kräfte Syriens":** The candidate uses "syrischen Demokratischen Kräfte" (Syrian Democratic Forces), while the reference uses "Demokratischen Kräfte Syriens" (Democratic Forces of Syria), demonstrating both a positional and naming difference, with the reference being more conceptually aligned.		2. **"sweeping" → "überflutet" → "durchkämmen":** The term "überflutet" (flooded) is a mistranslation of "sweeping" in this context. The intended meaning is "durchkämmen" (combing through), which fits the context of security forces searching an area.		3. **"militants" → "Menschen" → "Kämpfern":** "Menschen" (people) is a significant mistranslation of "militants", which is correctly referred to as "Kämpfern" (fighters) in the reference.		4. **"holed up" → "festsitzen" → "vergraben":** The phrase "festsitzen" (to be stuck) does not carry the same sense as "holed up" in terms of being deliberately hidden or entrenched, for which "vergraben" (entrenched) is the appropriate term.
civilian → zivile → Zivilpersonen  	hostages → Geiseln → Zivilpersonen  	of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told → von dem Militärrat des SDF, der Manbij Rat, sagte → des mit dem DKS verbündeten Manbij Militärrats mit  		**Explanation:**  	1. "zivile Geiseln" (civilian hostages) is a mistranslation of "Zivilpersonen" (civilians), which changes the nature of the people freed. These terms are not equivalent, violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by incorrectly doubling the people as both civilian and hostages.  	2. "von dem Militärrat des SDF, der Manbij Rat, sagte" (of the military council of the SDF, the Manbij council, said) significantly alters the structure and meaning compared to "des mit dem DKS verbündeten Manbij Militärrats mit" (of the SDF allied Manbij Military Council told), impacting comprehension. The most critical errors are in the translation of "SDF" (DKS) and the grammatical role of the speaker structure.
1. fully → voll → vollkommener  	2. sweeping → durchgreifende → Aufräumarbeiten  		**Explanation:**  	- "voll" (full) is a mistranslation of "fully", which should be "vollkommener" (more complete) to match the intended nuance in the reference translation. This affects the **Contextual Accuracy** and changes the depth of control implied.  	- "durchgreifende" (decisive) is a mistranslation of "sweeping" in this context, which should be "Aufräumarbeiten" (clean-up operations) to correctly convey the type of operations being referenced. The meaning shift violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Clintons → Clinton → Clintons  	earned → verdiente → verdienen  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation has "Clinton" instead of "Clintons," changing the number implied from plural to singular, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. It also uses "verdiente" (past tense) instead of "verdienen" (present tense), conflicting with the reference translation. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as the temporal context is relevant to the sentence meaning.
returns → Steuerrückflüsse → Steuererklärung  	federal → föderalen → Bundes  		**Explanation:** "Steuerrückflüsse" is a mistranslation of "tax returns," where "Steuerrückflüsse" implies a concept of financial flows rather than "Steuererklärung," which is the correct term for tax returns. "föderalen" translates to "federal" but does not fit contextually as "Bundes" is the appropriate term for referring to taxes at a national level in Germany.
former secretary of state → ehemalige Staatssekretärin → ehemalige Außenministerin		**Explanation:** "Staatssekretärin" (state secretary) is mistranslated, as it refers to a different position than "Außenministerin" (secretary of state). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it changes the correct title held by Hillary Clinton.
running mate → Senator → Kandidat für die Vizepräsidentschaft  	returns → Steuererträge → Steuererklärungen  		**Explanation:** "Senator" is a mistranslation of "running mate," which refers specifically to someone running for vice presidency, a more specific and contextually correct term is "Kandidat für die Vizepräsidentschaft." "Steuererträge" (tax revenues) is a mistranslation of "returns," as "Steuererklärungen" (tax returns) is the correct term for personal tax filings. These errors significantly alter the meaning as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
federal → föderalen → Bundes  		**Explanation:** "föderalen" (federal) is a literal translation, but the correct term in this context, as per the reference, is "Bundes" (federal), which aligns better with the standard German terminology for governmental levels, thereby following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Clinton campaign aide → Clinton → Clintons Kampagnenhelferin  	Jennifer Palmieri → Jennifer Palmini → Jennifer Palmieri  		**Explanation:** "Clinton" is used to translate "Clinton campaign aide," which changes the meaning by removing the reference to "campaign aide" or "Kampagnenhelferin." Additionally, "Jennifer Palmieri" is inaccurately translated as "Jennifer Palmini," which alters the identity of the person being quoted. Both instances conform to the **Identify Mistranslations** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	tax returns → Steuererträge → Steuererklärungen  		**Explanation:** "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump" due to an additional trailing letter 'f'. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it is not the correct spelling of the individual's name. "Steuererträge" (tax revenues) is a mistranslation of "tax returns". The sense of the original about financial disclosure is lost, which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as using "tax revenues" does not accurately reflect the intended message of tax return disclosure.
tax returns → Steuererträge → Steuererklärungen		**Explanation:** "Steuererträge" (tax revenues) is a mistranslation of "tax returns." This significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, as "tax returns" refer to personal tax filings rather than the collected tax revenues, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	Internal Revenue Service → Internen Einkommens → Steuerbehörden  	returns → Rückkehr → Steuererklärungen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump". This follows the **Identify Mistranslations** rule as it misrepresents the name of an important entity.	- "Internen Einkommens" (Internal Income) is a mistranslation of "Internal Revenue Service", significantly altering the intended meaning and violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Rückkehr" (return in the sense of coming back) is a mistranslation of "returns", which, in this context, refers to "Steuererklärungen" (tax returns), violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by misrepresenting the document being discussed.
1. move → Bewegung → am Zug  	2. Campingaide → Campingaide → Wahlkampfhelferin  	3. Rückführungen → Rückführungen → Veröffentlichung  	4. Kandidaten → Kandidaten → Präsidentschaftskandidatin  		**Explanation:**	- "Bewegung" is a mistranslation of "move" in this context. The reference translation "am Zug" is idiomatic for "your move" in the sense of taking a turn or next step.	- "Campingaide" is a direct but incorrect transliteration of "campaign aide." The correct term is "Wahlkampfhelferin" in the reference.	- "Rückführungen" (returns) is not contextually correct for "returns" in the sense of financial or tax returns. The reference uses "Veröffentlichung," indicating a release or publication, which fits the context better.	- "Kandidaten" is a mistranslation when "Kandidatin" fits better in context, as it specifies the female candidate, aligning with "Democratic nominee" referring specifically to a female in the reference.
Trump's → Trumppe → Trumps  	Trump → Trumpf → Trump  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Trumppe" is a misspelling of "Trumps," as seen when comparing the candidate with the correct possessive form in the reference. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, where the mistranslation renders a grammatically incorrect form.	2. "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump," altering the meaning. "Trumpf" is not a valid translation of the person's name "Trump" in this context. This error is highlighted by the **Identify Mistranslations** rule.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** Although there are differences between the candidate and the reference translations, none of them represent a significant mistranslation of single words that change the sentence's meaning fundamentally. The key components such as Mitt Romney's identification, criticism context, and the areas of concern (net worth, charitable contributions, business dealings, and ties with Russia) are accurately conveyed. Therefore, no translation errors are marked following the given guidelines.
pounced → hingewiesen → gestürzt  	highlighting → nahe gelegt → auffordern  	Republicans → Republikanern → Republikaner  	taxes → Steuern → Steuererklärung  		**Explanation:**  	1. "hingewiesen" (indicated or pointed out) is a mistranslation of "pounced", which significantly changes the meaning as it does not capture the sense of urgency and active engagement.  	2. "nahe gelegt wird" (is suggested) is a mistranslation of "highlighting", missing the focus on bringing attention to an action, which is captured by "auffordern" (urge).  	3. "Republikanern" (Republicans in dative plural) is used instead of "Republikaner" (Republicans in nominative plural). Since the reference uses the nominative case, this changes who is doing the urging, not who is being urged.  	4. "Steuern" (taxes) is a mistranslation of "taxes" in terms of the context, as "Steuererklärung" (tax return) is specifically what Trump is being urged to release.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "dieses Thema" and "das Thema" correctly translate "the issue" in this context, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Though there is a repetition of "an," it does not affect the meaning derived from the words themselves and thus does not constitute a single-word translation error. The rest of the translation maintains the intended meaning, so no single-word mistranslations are present.
tax → Steuereinnahmen → Steuererklärungen		**Explanation:** "Steuereinnahmen" translates to "tax revenues," while the source refers to "tax returns," which is what "Steuererklärungen" correctly translates to. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as the incorrect term changes the meaning from individual financial disclosures to general tax revenue.
Politico → Politik → Politico	Trump → Trumpf → Trump	business → Wirtschaftswissenschaftler → Wirtschaftsjournalist	accountants → Wirtschaftsprüfern → Steuerberatern		**Explanation:**		1. **Politico → Politik → Politico**: The candidate translation incorrectly translates "Politico" as "Politik", which changes the meaning from a specific publication to a general concept, thereby violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. **Trump → Trumpf → Trump**: The candidate translation uses "Trumpf" instead of "Trump", which appears to be a typographical variation. This changes the specific reference to the person, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	3. **business → Wirtschaftswissenschaftler → Wirtschaftsjournalist**: The candidate translation uses "Wirtschaftswissenschaftler" (economist), whereas the reference uses "Wirtschaftsjournalist" (business journalist). The original context specifies a journalist, not a scientist.	4. **accountants → Wirtschaftsprüfern → Steuerberatern**: The candidate uses "Wirtschaftsprüfern" (auditors) instead of "Steuerberatern" (tax advisors/accountants). In the context of tax discussions, "Steuerberatern" is more accurate, aligning with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
tax rates → Bundessteuersätze → Bundessteuern  	presidential election → Präsidentschaftswahlen → Wahlkampf  		**Explanation:** "Bundessteuersätze" (federal tax rates) is a stricter term than "Bundessteuern" (federal taxes) and might not align perfectly with the reference context, but it's contextually acceptable given the specific mention of "rates" in the source. However, "Wahlkampf" (election campaign) captures the broader context of "presidential election" better than "Präsidentschaftswahlen" (presidential elections) when referring to the issue becoming a topic in that context.
endorse → gebilligt → unterstützt  	rule → Bestimmung → Regelung  	billionaire → Milliardenanleger → Milliardär  	make → einzahlen → verdienen  		**Explanation:**  		1. **"endorse" → "gebilligt" → "unterstützt":** "Gebilligt" (approved) implies more of a final agreement or sanction than "unterstützt" (supports), which aligns better with the softer endorsement context.	   	2. **"rule" → "Bestimmung" → "Regelung":** "Bestimmung" (provision) suggests a legal or formal resolution, whereas "Regelung" (regulation/rule) aligns precisely with the context of a rule or policy.	   	3. **"billionaire" → "Milliardenanleger" → "Milliardär":** "Milliardenanleger" (billion-dollar investor) is less accurate than "Milliardär" (billionaire), which captures the specific wealth status of Warren Buffett.	   	4. **"make" → "einzahlen" → "verdienen":** "Einzahlen" (deposit) suggests action different from earning or making income, which is correctly represented by "verdienen" (earn).
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** "Auch" and "ebenfalls" are both valid translations for "also" in this context. The meaning of the sentence is preserved, and there are no significant translation errors that violate the task instructions.
Buffett → dessen → forderte  	Steuereinnahmen → Steuereinnahmen → Steuererklärungen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "dessen" (whose) is used incorrectly to describe Buffett's action in the candidate sentence. The reference sentence uses "forderte" (challenged), which accurately conveys that Buffett challenged Trump, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	2. "Steuereinnahmen" (tax revenues) is a mistranslation of "tax returns". The correct term in the context of exchanging documents between individuals is "Steuererklärungen", adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the intended meaning.
Buffet → Trumpf → Trump  	afraid → Angst → Angst vor  	voters → Wähler → Wählern  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation contains errors in the translation of proper nouns and phrase structures which change the meaning of the sentence. "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of the name "Trump", violating **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**. "Angst" is used out of context as it should be "Angst vor", altering the phrase structure and meaning, adhering to **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**. "Wähler" (voter) should be "Wählern" (voters) to correctly match the grammatical structure and meaning, a single-word error under **Focus on Single-Word Errors**.
tax → Steuerrückflüsse → Steuererklärungen		**Explanation:** "Steuerrückflüsse" (tax refunds) is a mistranslation of "tax returns". This significantly changes the meaning as it refers to a financial refund rather than the documents showing taxes filed. The error is reported by focusing on the mistranslated word "Steuerrückflüsse" instead of the entire phrase, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
Chappaqua → Cappaqua → Chappaqua  	federal → föderalen → Bundes  		**Explanation:** "Cappaqua" is a misspelling of "Chappaqua". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the location name is incorrect. "föderalen" (federal) should be "Bundes" in the context of taxes, as "Bundessteuersatz" is the standard term for "federal tax rate" in German, which adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Clintons' → Clintons → der Clintons	return → Rückkehr → Steuererklärung	wages → Löhnen → Lohn		**Explanation:** 	1. "Clintons'" was translated as "Clintons". The possessive form in the source is best captured by "der Clintons" in the reference, adhering to **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.	2. "return" was mistranslated as "Rückkehr" (return as in going back), whereas the context clearly implies "Steuererklärung" (tax return), following **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.	3. "wages" was translated as "Löhnen" (plural), but the context in the reference suggests "Lohn" (singular), as per **Focus on Single-Word Errors**.
main → Haupt → hauptsächliche  	index mutual fund → gegenseitiger Fonds → Indexfonds  	dividend and interest income → Dividende und Zinsen → Dividenden und Erträge  	109,000 → 10,000 → 109.000  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Haupt" (main) does not align with "hauptsächliche" in the context of investments, where "hauptsächliche" better connects to "main".	2. "gegenseitiger Fonds" (mutual fund) does not reflect the complete concept of "index mutual fund", for which "Indexfonds" is the correct term.	3. "Dividende und Zinsen" (dividend and interest) is a mistranslation for "dividend and interest income", where "Dividenden und Erträge" (dividends and returns) is more accurate.	4. "10 000 Dollar" is an incorrect translation of the amount "$109,000".
editing → Editing → bearbeitet		**Explanation:** The candidate word "Editing" is the English word for editing, which does not match the translation style required in German. The reference uses "bearbeitet", which is correctly translated to match the context of an editorial contribution, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Zusatzberichte" and "Mit Beiträgen" are both valid translations in context, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, so no error is reported for those.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and the reference translation convey the same meaning, maintaining the core idea of condoms with chili powder and firecrackers enhancing elephant protection in Tanzania. Single-word differences such as "ChilliPulver-Kondome" (Chilli-powder condoms) vs. "Kondome mit Chilipuder" (condoms with chili powder) do not significantly alter the meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
conservationists → Konservativen → Naturschützer  	chilli → Kinderpulver → Chilipuder  		**Explanation:** "Konservativen" (conservatives) is a mistranslation of "conservationists," which changes the meaning from a focus on environmental activists to political conservatives. "Kinderpulver" (baby powder) is a mistranslation of "chilli powder," significantly altering the intended irritating effect on elephants. These errors are clear mistranslations and hence need correction following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
several → gegen → dazu  	Nature Conservancy → Naturschutzbehörde → Naturschutz  	training → ausgebildet → trainiert  	volunteers → Freiwillige → Freiwillige  	north → Nordtansania → Norden Tansanias  	crops → Kulturen → Ernte  		**Explanation:**  	1. **several → gegen → dazu:** "gegen" (against) is a mistranslation of "several". The reference provides "bereits vor Jahren" (several years ago), which maintains the intended meaning.	2. **Nature Conservancy → Naturschutzbehörde → Naturschutz:** "Naturschutzbehörde" (conservation authority) does not capture the proper noun term "Nature Conservancy". The reference uses "US-Naturschutz" which better aligns contextually with the intended meaning.	3. **training → ausgebildet → trainiert:** "ausgebildet" (educated) changes the nuance from "training", which is better suited for the ongoing process highlighted by "trainiert" in the reference.	4. **volunteers → Freiwillige → Freiwillige:** Initially considered correct, but upon thorough review, "Freiwillige" is correct in both, so this stands unchanged.	5. **north → Nordtansania → Norden Tansanias:** "Nordtansania" (North Tanzania) is factual but slightly misaligned with the proper noun usage "Norden Tansanias" from the reference, ensuring phrase cohesion alongside the broader region.	6. **crops → Kulturen → Ernte:** "Kulturen" (cultures) mistakenly shifts the meaning; "Ernte" (harvest/crops) is accurate in context.
many → zu → viele  	spears → ihrer → Speere  		**Explanation:** The word "zu" in the candidate does not correlate with "many" from the source and reference and does not convey the same meaning in context. The translation of "spears" is absent, leading to "ihren" being improperly positioned in the translation. The focus is on ensuring key words retain their meaning from the source to the candidate translation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the correct meaning, albeit with a slightly different structure, and translates "World Elephant Day" and "protection of the animals" accurately as "Weltelefantentag" and "Tierschutz," respectively. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as the overall meaning is preserved.
Sinneswandel → Änderung → Änderung ihrer Einstellung  	Gemeinschaften → Gemeinschaften → Gemeinden  	Exekutivdirektor → Exekutivdirektor → Geschäftsführer  	Honeyführer → Honeyführers → Honeyguide  		**Explanation:**  	- "Sinneswandel" is a mistranslation of "attitude change", which corresponds to "Änderung ihrer Einstellung". The candidate translation fails to capture the concept of a shift in attitude, focusing instead on a change of mind, which alters the intended meaning. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Gemeinschaften" is not the correct translation of "communities" as intended in this context, where "Gemeinden" is preferred due to its relation to local administrative or community structures. Hence, it does not maintain the contextual meaning defined under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Exekutivdirektor" generally aligns with "executive director", but in this context, "Geschäftsführer" is the expected reference, matching the structure found in the reference translation.	- "Honeyführer" is a clear mistranslation of "Honeyguide", which is a specific name rather than a common noun. The word "Honeyführers" does not preserve the intended name, breaching the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
first → Trägerlefant → Elefant  	shining → läuten → Beleuchten  	sounding → klingen → Blasen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Trägerlefant" is not an accurate translation for "elephant" (possibly a morphological error or an incorrect form). This violates both the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Identify Mistranslations** rules.	2. "läuten" (ring) is a mistranslation of "shining". In this context, "Beleuchten" (illuminate) is the correct term, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule due to the significant change in action.	3. "klingen" (sound) is a mistranslation of "sounding" in the context of using a horn. "Blasen" (blow) should be used, adhering to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
chilli → chillische → Chili		**Explanation:** "chillische" is a mistranslation of "chilli". The reference uses "Chili", which directly corresponds to the source. "chillische" does not accurately convey the intended meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Chilli powder → Chili-Pulver → Chilipuder  	soil → Boden → Erde  	firecracker → Feuerwascher → Feuerwerkskörper  	fuse → ausgelaufenen Fass → Zündschnur  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Chili-Pulver" is a mistranslation of "Chilli powder." "Chili-Pulver" is not the standard term compared to "Chilipuder" in the context of ingredients used in this sense.	2. "Boden" (ground) is a mistranslation here for "soil", which should be "Erde" in this context.	3. "Feuerwascher" (which is not a relevant term) is a mistranslation of "firecracker", which should be "Feuerwerkskörper" since the context involves an explosive device.	4. "ausgelaufenen Fass" (spilled barrel) is a mistranslation for "fuse", which in the context of fireworks is "Zündschnur".
lit → sich abrechnen → angezündet  	bang → Bang → Knall  	fine → schönen → feinen  	chilli → Kinderpulver → Chilipuder  		**Explanation:**  	- "sich abrechnen" (settle accounts) is a mistranslation of "lit" (angezündet), which relates to lighting something on fire. This adheres to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it doesn't fit the action described in the source.	- "Bang" is an untranslated English onomatopoeia, while "Knall" is the correct German equivalent. This follows **Focus on Single-Word Errors** as we're targeting the sound description error.	- "schönen" (beautiful) incorrectly describes "fine" in the context of powder, which should be "feinen", based on the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Kinderpulver" (children's powder) is a mistranslation of "chilli powder" (Chilipuder). This significantly distorts the meaning following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
whiff → Witz → Hauch  	send → schicken → verjagen  		**Explanation:** "Witz" (joke) is a mistranslation of "whiff," which refers to a smell, not something humorous. "schicken" (send) does not fully capture the intent of "verjagen" (scare away), which implies making the elephant move in avoidance, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
last resort → letztes Mittel → letzte Möglichkeit  	launcher → Trägerraket → Werfer  	Roman candle → römisches Kerzenfeuer → Goldregenfeuerwerk  	bright → gute → helle  		**Explanation:** 		1. "letztes Mittel" (last resort) is a direct translation but does not capture the more idiomatic use of "last resort" in the source, where "letzte Möglichkeit" provides clearer context.	2. "Trägerraket" (carrier rocket) does not fittingly translate "launcher" in this context as "Werfer" (thrower) is more appropriate for fireworks.	3. "römisches Kerzenfeuer" translates "Roman candle" too literally, while "Goldregenfeuerwerk" correctly indicates a type of firework known as Roman candle.	4. "gute" (good) does not convey the intended adjective "bright" for an explosion, unlike "helle" (bright).
council → Gemeinderat → Stadtrat  	kiosk → Stock → Kioskneubau  		**Explanation:**		1. "Gemeinderat" (municipal council) is a close equivalent to "Stadtrat" (city council), but "Gemeinderat" is not entirely accurate given "Stadtrat" is more appropriate for city-related matters, following standard usage conventions. However, since this doesn't significantly change the meaning by itself, this can be debated.		2. "Stock" (floor/level) is a clear mistranslation of "kiosk", which changes the meaning significantly. The source and reference focus on a structure like a "kiosk" or a small "stall", while "Stock" implies a part of a building.		"Stadtrat" could be contextually argued, but the mismatch with "Stock" is significant and incorrect in the context, thus making it a meaningful mistranslation.
**St. Goarer → St. Gärer → St. Goarer**		**Explanation:** "St. Gärer" is a mistranslation of "St. Goarer." The name of the location should remain consistent with the reference translation, as per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Other variations in translation do not constitute errors, as they maintain the overall meaning or offer acceptable synonyms.
Rhine balcony → Rhein-Ballons → Rheinbalkons  		**Explanation:** "Rhein-Ballons" (Rhine balloons) is a mistranslation of "Rhine balcony". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the translation does not refer correctly to the intended structure and significantly changes the meaning of the sentence.
kiosk → Ekel → Kiosk		**Explanation:** "Ekel" (disgust) is a mistranslation of "kiosk". This significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, because the original intention was to refer to a specific type of business, not an expression of disgust.
Jewish filmmaker → Jüdische Filmemacher-Hotel → Jüdischer Regisseur  	slams → Hotel → zerschlägt  	removing → um → entfernt  	Israel dial code → Israel → israelische Vorwahl  	after Arab "request" → nach arabischem "Antrag" → nach "arabischer" Aufforderung  		**Explanation:** "Jüdische Filmemacher-Hotel" is a mistranslation of "Jewish filmmaker," which is "Jüdischer Regisseur" in the reference. "Hotel" is a part of a mistranslation, incorrectly placed, and should be attributed to "slams." "Um" mistranslates "removing," which should be "entfernt." "Israel" in the candidate sentence omits specificity, whereas "israelische Vorwahl" specifies it is the dial code. Lastly, "arabischem" is a mistranslation of "Arab 'request'," and "Antrag" should be "Aufforderung" to maintain the sentence's intended nuance.
media furor → Medienirrtum → Medienaufruhr  	revealed → aufgedeckt → verraten  	employee → Arbeitnehmer → Mitarbeiter  	dial code → Leitfaden → Vorwahl
frustration → Frustration → Ärger  	vented → heraufbeschworen → ließ aus  	FAZ → AZ → FAZ  		**Explanation:**  	- "Frustration" is a mistranslation of "Ärger". While related, "Ärger" (anger) more accurately captures the emotional nuance intended in the context.	- "heraufbeschworen" (conjured) is a mistranslation for "vented", which should be closer to something like "ließ aus" (let out) to preserve the expression of releasing emotions.	- "AZ" is incorrect here, as the reference specifies "FAZ", a well-known German newspaper. Misidentifying the publication significantly alters the meaning and context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and reference translation convey the same meaning, with acceptable variations such as "jüngsten Aufenthalt" (recent stay) and "letzten Aufenthalt" (last stay), "Dialcodes" (dial codes) and "Ländervorwahlliste" (list of country codes). The meaning remains intact, so no significant translation errors are present according to the instructions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and reference translation convey the same overall meaning, focusing on the country not being mentioned among those one can call directly. Variations in phrases used, such as "erwähnt" (mentioned) versus "aufgelistet" (listed), or "Raum" (room) and "Hotelzimmer" (hotel room), are acceptable translations in context. They do not significantly change the meaning of the sentence, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Additionally, both renderings grammatically and contextually convey the same details, satisfying the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "ausgerottet" (eradicated) and "gelöscht" (deleted) can be considered conceptually similar in this context, albeit with slightly different connotations. The core meaning of the sentence remains the same, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. There are no single-word translation errors that significantly alter the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Lanzmann hat geschrieben" uses the present perfect tense, while the reference "schrieb Lanzmann" uses the simple past tense. Both are acceptable translations of the English past simple tense "wrote". The meaning is preserved in context, thus there are no significant single-word translation errors to report, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
dial → dialektieren → anzuwählen		**Explanation:** "dialektieren" is not a correct translation of "dial" in this context. The candidate translation uses an incorrect German term that does not fit the context, whereas "anzuwählen" correctly conveys the intended action of making a phone call. This mistranslation violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
explanation → Erklärungen → Erklärung  	filmmaker → Filmemacher → Regisseur  	issue → Frage → Erklärung  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Erklärungen" (explanations) is a mistranslation of "explanation." The singular form "Erklärung" is what's needed to match the source.	2. "Filmemacher" (filmmaker) is a literal translation, but "Regisseur" (director) is a more precise match for the context when discussing film in German.	3. "Frage" (question) is incorrectly used for "issue." In the context of addressing an issue before reaching out, "Erklärung" (explanation) is more appropriate as it aligns with resolving concerns rather than asking questions, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
answer → Antwort → Antwort  	got → schrieb → erhielt  	Lanzmann → (missing) → Lanzmann  		**Explanation:**  		1. "Antwort" is correctly translated, so no errors here. 	2. "schrieb" translates to "wrote" rather than "got". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since it changes the stated action.	3. "Lanzmann" is missing in the candidate translation, which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it attributes the quote incorrectly.
clerk → Clerk → Hotelangestellte  	management → Leitung → Management  	Kempinski-Hotels → Kempins-Hotels → Kempinski Hotels  		**Explanation:** "Clerk" remains untranslated from English, while the correct translation is "Hotelangestellte" (hotel clerk). "Leitung" (leadership) does not accurately reflect "management" as it could change the meaning in the context of organizational structure. The brand name "Kempinski" is misspelled as "Kempins," which is an error that could lead to misunderstanding.
reason → Grund → Grund, der dahinter stand  	outrage → Empörung → Wut  	filmmaker → Filmemacher → Regisseur  		**Explanation:**		1. For "reason": The term "Grund" in the candidate is a direct translation of "reason." However, the reference "Grund, der dahinter stand" is a more contextual translation. Given the context, where "behind the move" is part of the core phrase, the translation should reflect that nuance. 		2. For "outrage": The word "Empörung" (outrage) in the candidate does not accurately convey the intensity or personal nature implied by the reference "Wut" (anger/rage). Given the emotional context associated with a filmmaker's reaction, "Wut" is a more precise translation to maintain the intended intensity.		3. For "filmmaker": The candidate uses "Filmemacher," which is a less common way to refer to a filmmaker in German. The reference uses "Regisseur," a more widely recognized and contextually appropriate term in German for someone who makes films, especially noting that "Wut" is felt by the filmmaker rather than caused by him, reflecting a shift in understanding who feels the outrage.
Israel's code → israelischen Kodex → Vorwahl  		**Explanation:** "israelischen Kodex" is a mistranslation of "Israel's code" where the context refers to a phone code. The reference translation suggests "Vorwahl" (area code) which is more contextually appropriate than "Kodex" (code of conduct or legal code). This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by identifying "Vorwahl" as the correct term.
Yakov → Yakow → Yakov  	Hadas-Handelsman → Hads-Handelsman → Hadas-Handelsman  	reports → Berichte → berichtet  	Suddeutsche → Suddeutsche → Süddeutsche  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Yakov" in the source and reference is mistranslated as "Yakow" in the candidate. Proper names should be transliterated accurately.  	2. "Hadas-Handelsman" in the source and reference is mistranslated as "Hads-Handelsman" in the candidate. Proper names must be accurate.  	3. "reports" is mistranslated as "Berichte" (list of reports) instead of "berichtet" (3rd person singular of report), leading to a grammatical and contextual error.  	4. "Suddeutsche" lacks the umlaut in the candidate which is present in the reference "Süddeutsche", which changes the correct proper noun.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "entsetzt und schockiert über den Vorfall" is a valid translation of "appalled and shocked by the incident". While there are differences in word choice compared to the reference translation "von diesem Ereignis entsetzt und bestürzt", the overall meaning is preserved. The words used are near-synonyms or contextually appropriate, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence "Das ist an sich eine große Schande" and the reference "Das ist wirklich sehr beschämend" convey the same meaning as the source sentence "It is in itself a great shame." The candidate provides an accurate translation of the sentiment and meaning, so no meaningful errors are identified, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and aligns well with the reference translation. The words used in the candidate translation are contextually appropriate, and there are no significant mistranslations that alter the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Das bedarf keiner Erklärung." matches the reference translation exactly. Hence, there are no mistranslations to report, following the **No translation errors detected** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence with all the words correctly translated. "Beamte" and "Amtsträger" are both valid translations for "official," thereby following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. The quotes are slightly misplaced, but they don't result in a single-word translation error as per the task's instructions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation, while using different wording ("Online-Reaktion" vs. "Resonanz im Internet"), maintains the meaning of the source sentence effectively. Both translations convey the idea of a significant reaction on the internet. Additionally, "Menschen ihn als einen Skandal bezeichnen" captures the reference's meaning of "calling it a scandal." Therefore, there are no significant mistranslations that alter the original sentence's meaning, complying with the instructions' rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence in context. "Einige" and "behaupteten" are appropriate translations for "Some" and "alleged", respectively. "Das Kempinski-Hotel" matches the named entity correctly, and "eingeknickt" captures the idiomatic expression "caved in", aligned with "nachgegeben hätte". The words chosen do not significantly change the meaning or context compared to the source, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Therefore, there are no significant errors to report.
Shame → Schande → Schämt  	post → Posten → Beitrag  	noble → edlen → noblen  	street → Straße → Kurfürstendamm
accusations → Anschuldigungen → Vorfall  	brush off → abgerissen → wies von sich  		**Explanation:** "Anschuldigungen" is used in both the candidate and reference translations, but it should align with the context of the incident, hence "Vorfall" (incident) is appropriate. "Abgerissen" (torn down) does not fit the context of "brush off," which should be "wies von sich" (dismissed).
1. order → Befehl → Anweisung	2. fast → Fast → Schnellwahl	3. dial → didalliste → Schnellwahlliste	4. Suddeutsche → Suddeutsche → Süddeutsche	5. Kempinski → Keminski → Kempinski		**Explanation:** 	- "Befehl" (order) is translated as "order," but in this context, "Anweisung" (directive/instruction) is more appropriate.	- "Fast-didalliste" reflects an error in both "Fast" instead of "Schnellwahl" and "didalliste" which should be the single word "Schnellwahlliste."	- "Suddeutsche" should have an umlaut, written as "Süddeutsche," and "Keminski" is a misspelling of "Kempinski."		These errors collectively violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as they both alter and break the context of the original sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence. Both "Kodex" and "Ländervorwahl" can be considered appropriate translations for "code" in different contexts, but without additional context, it is not possible to definitively declare one incorrect. Hence, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no single-word translation error can be determined.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Die Polizei verwendet Tränengas- und Gummigeschosse gegen protestierende brasilianische Studenten" conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. The words and structure accurately represent the source sentence, and the use of "verwendet" for "use" and "Tränengas- und Gummigeschosse" for "tear gas & rubber bullets" is contextually appropriate. Thus, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, no significant errors are identified.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. Key actions and elements like "clashed" (stießen zusammen), "demonstrate" (um zu demonstrieren), "government reforms" (Regierungsreformen), and "public education system" (öffentliches Bildungssystem) are accurately translated. Additionally, the structure and word choices, like "trafen zusammen," can be considered a synonymous and idiomatic expression of "stießen zusammen" in this context. Therefore, no single-word translation errors are present in the candidate sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the meaning of the original source sentence accurately. Both "hat eingesetzt" and "setzte ein" effectively convey the use of tear gas and rubber bullets, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule where different verb tenses do not significantly change the intended meaning. Therefore, no single-word mistranslations are identified.
law enforcement → Vollzugsbeamte → Polizeibeamte  	disperse → zersplittern → auseinanderzutreiben  		**Explanation:** "Vollzugsbeamte" refers to enforcement officers but lacks the specific context of "police," making "Polizeibeamte" the more accurate term in context. "Zersplittern" means "to shatter" or "to splinter," which incorrectly conveys the context of "disperse," where "auseinanderzutreiben" is more accurate for dissolving a crowd. These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although there are slight variations, such as the use of "Demonstration" instead of "Demonstrationen" and "zum Ausdruck zu bringen" instead of "auszudrücken," these are acceptable variations and do not significantly change the meaning. Therefore, according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, no translation errors are reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In this case, the candidate translation adequately captures the meaning of the source sentence. Despite slight differences in wording, such as "knapp" vs. "etwas weniger als" and "umgesiedelt" vs. "umgesetzt", the meanings are equivalent. According to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, these variations do not significantly change the sentence's meaning, so no single-word translation errors are identified.
some → feststellen → sah  	writing → feststellen → sprühen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "feststellen" (to ascertain or determine) does not fit the context of the sentence, where it should indicate people being observed or noted ("sah", which means saw). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "feststellen" (determine) is also used in the place of "writing" graffiti, which skews the meaning significantly. The reference indicates the action was "sprühen" (spraying), maintaining the original meaning of creating graffiti. This stresses the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule to highlight misuse in context.
suspended → Präsident → Präsidentin  	impeachment → Verleumdung → Abberufung  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Präsident" (President) is correct in isolation, but it lacks the necessary gender context provided by "suspended President Dilma Rousseff", where "Präsidentin" (female president) is needed to match the reference. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the gender is significant here.		2. "Verleumdung" (defamation) is a mistranslation of "impeachment". "Abberufung" (removal from office) more accurately captures the specific political process described in the context, aligning with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by preserving the intended meaning and process involving Dilma Rousseff.
surges → beträgt → steigt  		**Explanation:** "beträgt" (amounts to) is a mistranslation of "surges" (increases rapidly). This significantly changes the meaning of the sentence by implying a steady state rather than a sudden increase, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. While there are some differences in structure, there are no single-word errors that significantly alter the meaning of the sentence. The phrase "von Jahr zu Jahr" (year-on-year) is a reasonable translation of "in year-on-year terms," and the rest of the translation correctly captures the intended message.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. Phrasing differences such as "hat das Interesse zugenommen" vs. "wuchs das Interesse stark an" do not significantly alter the meaning. The core message about the lifting of sanctions and the increased interest of Russian firms is preserved.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The phrases "knüpfen die bestehenden Beziehungen" and "nehmen bestehende Verbindungen auf" both effectively translate "are resuming existing ties." Similarly, "bereit sind, Zugang zum Markt zu erhalten" and "bereit sind, sich Zugang zum Markt zu verschaffen" both correctly capture the idea of being ready to access the market. As these convey the correct meaning in context, there are no significant single-word translation errors in the candidate translation.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The differences between "weiteren Ausweitung" and "weiteren Handelsausbau" or "Hauptprioritäten" and "größten Prioritäten" are minor stylistic variations that do not significantly alter the meaning. Thus, no significant translation errors are present according to the instructions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Each component of the candidate sentence accurately conveys the information from the source sentence when compared to the reference. Though there are slight variations in word choice, such as "stellte fest" versus "merkte an," these do not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence and are contextually appropriate, fulfilling the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
exports → Exporte → Importe  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Exporte" (exports), whereas the source sentence indicates that it should be "Importe" (imports). This is a significant error as it changes the direction of the trade, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively captures the essential meaning of the source sentence. There are no single-word translation errors as both translations reflect the same information regarding the increase in Russian imports from Iran by 16 percent to $158 million, as per the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Similar expressions for percentage increase and the target amount are conveyed.
trade → Handels → Handelsaufschwung  	ground → Boden → Landfahrzeugen  		**Explanation:** "Handels" (trade) is used in the candidate translation instead of "Handelsaufschwung" (boost in trade), which changes the focus from an increase in trade to trade itself, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by missing the key concept of "boost". "Boden" (ground) is a mistranslation of "ground vehicles", resulting in a loss of specific details necessary for understanding the sentence, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. The expectation of a record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia is accurately translated. The phrasing differences ("erwartet, dass...besuchen wird" vs. "geht von...aus") are stylistic variations and do not represent meaningful errors. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation does not contain significant mistranslations in terms of single words when compared to the source and reference sentences. The words and phrases used in the candidate translation align well with the reference in meaning and intent, fulfilling the task requirements while considering permissible variations and synonyms.
enter → eingedrungen → erreichte		**Explanation:** "eingedrungen" (penetrated/entered forcefully) is a mistranslation of "entered" in the context of a ranking or list, where "erreichte" (reached) would be more appropriate. This significantly alters the meaning of the sentence in line with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** 	The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence. The phrase structures are valid, and although they do not perfectly match the reference translation, the crucial elements are correct. There are no significant single-word translation errors that alter the intended meaning of the source sentence. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, recognizing the variations in translation that do not impact the message.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While the candidate uses "was" instead of "etwas, von dem der Botschafter", this does not significantly change the meaning in context. The rest of the translation aligns well with the source, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Each word in the candidate translation aligns well with the source and reference sentences. The translation retains the same meaning and intended message without any significant deviations or changes. Despite slight structural differences, both the candidate and reference translations accurately convey the meaning of the source sentence, in accordance with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
- wanted → wollten → gesucht  	- drinks → Rohöl → Getränkemarkt  		**Explanation:** "wollten" (wanted) is a mistranslation of "gesucht" (sought or wanted in the context of searching), which changes the meaning regarding the search for witnesses. "Rohöl" (crude oil) is a mistranslation of "Getränkemarkt" (drinks market), distorting the fact that a beverage store was involved, significantly altering the context. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
robbery → Raub → Raubüberfall  	drinks → Getränken → Getränkemarkt  	Walbröl → Walbröl → Waldbröler  		**Explanation:**  	- "Raub" (robbery) is a less specific translation of "Raubüberfall" (robbery/raid), which is more precise for the context of a crime involving theft using force or threat. This matches the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule since it alters the severity implied.	- "Getränken" (drinks) is not an accurate translation of "Getränkemarkt" (drinks market/cash-and-carry); the term "Getränkemarkt" denotes a specific type of store, whereas "Getränken" could imply just beverages. This fits the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Walbröl" is a misspelled form of "Waldbröler". In this context, the spelling affects the geographical name and is essential for proper reference.
dressed → gekleidet → vermummt  	brandished → geschossen → Vorhalt  	cash-and-carry → Geldübergabe → Getränkemarktes  	made a run for it → sich auf den Fuß gesetzt → flüchteten zu Fuß  		**Explanation:**  	- "gekleidet" translates to "dressed," which is awkward and incorrect in the context where "vermummt" (covered) is correct because it pertains to the faces being covered.	- "geschossen" means "shot," which changes the meaning from "brandished" (simply wielding or showing a weapon).	- "Geldübergabe" (money handover) was used instead of specifying the location type "cash-and-carry," which is analogous to "Getränkemarktes" (a type of store in context).	- "sich auf den Fuß gesetzt" means "sat down on their feet," which is incorrect instead of "flüchteten zu Fuß" (made a run for it on foot).
No translation errors detected.
1.6 → 1,6 → 1,60  	1.7 → 1,7 → 1,70  	tall → mal → groß  	short → kurz → klein  		**Explanation:**  	- The decimal points in German numbers are represented by commas, so "1.6" and "1.7" are not direct mistranslations; however, their format in fractions is slightly off in comparison (1,6 → 1,60 and 1,7 → 1,70) for consistency, although European style often varies.	- "tall" is mistranslated as "mal" (times), which is incorrect in this context. The correct translation should be "groß" meaning "tall."	- "short" is mistranslated as "kurz" (short in length), while "klein" would be the appropriate word for "short" in height.
drinks cash-and-carry → Getränke → Getränkemarkt  	car park → Autopark → Parkdeck  	tricky → schwer → schlecht  		**Explanation:**  	1. **drinks cash-and-carry → Getränke → Getränkemarkt**: "Getränke" (drinks) inaccurately translates "drinks cash-and-carry," which refers to a specific type of wholesale store, indicated by "Getränkemarkt" in the reference.	2. **car park → Autopark → Parkdeck**: "Autopark" (car park) inaccurately represents the specific context of a "supermarket's car park" as "Parkdeck" (parking deck) in the reference.	3. **tricky → schwer → schlecht**: "schwer" (hard/difficult) incorrectly conveys "tricky," which refers to being difficult to observe. "schlecht einsehbar" (poorly visible) captures the intended meaning.
1. robbery → Raub → Überfall  	   **Explanation:** "Raub" typically refers to "robbery" or "heist," but in this context, "Überfall" is the appropriate term for the act of the crime described.		2. Wieg → Wieg → Weg  	   **Explanation:** "Wieg" is a misspelling of "Weg," which correctly refers to a "way" or "path."		3. Ostetarparkplatz → Ostetarparkplatz → Schotterparkplatz  	   **Explanation:** "Ostetarparkplatz" seems to be a miswrite or nonsensical term, whereas "Schotterparkplatz" is the intended term, meaning "gravel parking lot."		4. Multistorey-Autopark → Multistorey-Autopark → Parkhauseinfahrt  	   **Explanation:** "Multistorey-Autopark" is a mistranslation; the reference implies "Parkhauseinfahrt," referring to an entrance of a multi-storey car park.		Additionally, the following changes are noted but do not qualify as single-word errors:		- "B-256 (Schladerringstraße)" in the candidate erroneously blends terms and is different from "B 256 (Schladernring)" in the reference. A single isolated word error is not pronounced.	- "geflohen sein" is repeated and misplaces the sequence structure in comparison to "gerannt und geflüchtet" in the reference. This necessitates broader language restructuring to accurately convey the original sentence's meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both the candidate and reference translations convey the same meaning as the source sentence. The slight differences in phrasing do not significantly alter the meaning or context of the sentence. Following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, there are no notable errors present.
Fun → Fun → Spaß  	games → Spiele → Spiel  	summer fete → Sommerfeige → Sommerfreizeit  		**Explanation:**  	- "Fun" is not translated into German in the candidate sentence, where the correct translation should be "Spaß".	- "games" is translated as "Spiele" in the candidate, but the context and reference suggest using "Spiel" to match the fixed phrase "Spiel und Spaß".	- "fete" is translated as "Sommerfeige", which is incorrect as it suggests "fig" (Feige). The correct phrase should be "Sommerfreizeit" in this context. 		These errors significantly alter the meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
1. youth work day group → Jugendarbeitsgruppe → sozialpädagogischen Tagesgruppe	2. child protection league → Kinderschutzliga → Kinderschutzbund	3. gloriously happy → wunderbare → schöne und frohe	4. social workers → Sozialarbeitern → Betreuern		**Explanation:** 	- "Jugendarbeitsgruppe" (youth work group) is a mistranslation of "youth work day group" and does not capture the municipal or therapeutic context suggested by "sozialpädagogischen Tagesgruppe".	- "Kinderschutzliga" (child protection league) is a mistranslation of "child protection league", which should be "Kinderschutzbund" as used in the German context.	- "wunderbare" (wonderful) does not capture the same nuance as "gloriously happy", which is better represented by "schöne und frohe".	- "Sozialarbeitern" (social workers) is less accurate in this context compared to "Betreuern" (caregivers), which fits the context of a camp environment as given in the reference.
lively → lebendige → lebensfreudige  	peacefully-located → friedlich → ruhig  	Hartwäldle → Hartwild → Hardtwäldle  		**Explanation:**  	1. "lebendige" (lively) is a close but not exact translation of "lebensfreudige" (which implies joyfulness and eagerness for life). The nuance indicates a significant change in the conveyed meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	2. "friedlich" (peaceful) differs subtly but significantly from "ruhig" (quiet), affecting the description of the location. Contextually, the setting is likely tranquil, not necessarily devoid of conflict, triggering the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	3. "Hartwild" is a mistranslation of "Hartwäldle," which is more accurately represented as "Hardtwäldle," as indicated in the reference. This is a straightforward naming error, fitting the **Identify Mistranslations** rule.
day → Tagesreisen → Ganztagesausflüge  	agenda → (missing) → Programm  		**Explanation:** "Tagesreisen" (day trips) lacks the "whole-day" nuance present in "Ganztagesausflüge" (full day trips). Thus, "day" is a mistranslation that misses part of the intended meaning. The word "agenda" is also missing in the candidate translation entirely; it should have been translated to align with "Programm" in the reference, indicating another aspect of the intended meaning was lost.
trip → Reise → ging  	petting → Pflanzen → Streichel  		**Explanation:** "Reise" (trip) is a valid translation for "trip," but the context in the reference provides "ging" as a more direct equivalent to "saw the group head to" which implies the motion towards the destination. "Pflanzenzoo" (plant zoo) is a mistranslation of "petting zoo," as it changes the meaning significantly. The correct translation should be "Streichelzoo."
saw → sah → nach  	where → wo → im  	cloisters → Clister → Kloster  	tour → Reise → Führung  		**Explanation:** 	- "saw" is mistranslated as "sah" (saw) instead of "nach" indicating direction or purpose as in the reference. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because "saw" changes the context of the visit to Maulbronn.	- "where" is mistranslated as "wo" (where) instead of "im" (in the), which fits the contextual structure of the reference sentence.	- "cloisters" is mistranslated as "Clister" (an incorrect and non-standard form) instead of "Kloster" (monastery). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "tour" is mistranslated as "Reise" (journey) instead of "Führung" (guided tour), which changes the organized and guided aspect of the children's tour. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
third → dritte → dritten  	trip → Reise → Ausflug  	took → fuhr → führte  	Pfozheim → Pfozheim → Pforzheim  		**Explanation:**  	- "dritte" should be "dritten" to match the correct gender and case in German for "Ausflug."	- "Reise" translates to "trip," but the context implies "Ausflug," which is more accurate for a group activity or excursion.  	- "fuhr" should be "führte" as it correctly indicates being led or guided to a destination.	- "Pfozheim" is a misspelling of "Pforzheim," which straightforwardly represents the target location.
lived → gelebt → Alltag	ate → essen → Nahrung		**Explanation:** "gelebt" (lived) translates the source literally but doesn't convey the same breadth as "Alltag" (everyday life), which covers the entire lifestyle. While "essen" (to eat) is a literal translation of "ate," "Nahrung" (food) more accurately matches the intended meaning in the context of learning what they ate.
group → Gruppe → Gruppe		cooled off → abgerissen → vergnügte sich  	**Explanation:** The phrase "abgerissen" in the candidate sentence is incorrect as it conveys "torn down" in German, which doesn't align with the intended "cooled off" or "vergnügte sich" meaning.		dates → Terminen → Tagen  	**Explanation:** "Terminen" is a mistranslation in this context as it refers to scheduled appointments or dates, rather than "hot days" ("heißen Tagen"), which fits the context of the sentence about cooling off.		perfect → perfekt → einlud  	**Explanation:** The word "perfekt" incorrectly translates "perfect for" to imply something is exceptional, when the context implies an invitation or suitability, captured by "einlud" (invited).		jumping into → Einmarsch → Springen  	**Explanation:** "Einmarsch" means "marching" in German, which does not fit the context of water activities. The correct activity is "Springen" (jumping into).		paddling → Peitsche → Planschen  	**Explanation:** "Peitsche" translates to "whip" in German, which entirely misses the intended water activity of "paddling" or "splashing around," captured by "Planschen" (splashing around).
Children → Kinder → Kulinarisch  	carers → Betreuer → verwöhnt  	cooked → gekocht → verwöhnt  	own → eigene → deren selbst zubereiteten  	favourite → Lieblingsmehle → Leibspeisen  	meals → Mehle → Leibspeisen  	spätzle → Spüle → Spätzle  	dumplings → Deponien → Spätzle  	sour → Seifenküste → Sauren  	bolognese → Bolognese → Bolognese  	Tübingen-style → Tübingen-Muster → Tübinger   		**Explanation:**		1. "Mehle" (flours) is a mistranslation of "meals". "Lieblingsspeisen" or "Leibspeisen" would be correct for "favourite meals."	2. "Spüle-Deponien" (sink deposits) is an incorrect rendering of "spätzle dumplings."	3. "Seifenküste" (soap coast) is a mistranslation of "sour sauce," which significantly alters meaning.	4. "Kulinarisch" (culinary) is part of the reference phrase but doesn't match the source word "Children."	5. "verwohnt" (pampered) does not translate the action of "cooked," changing the helper's activities. "Gekocht" reflects the literal action seen in the source.	6. The reference phrase lacks direct equivalents for "carers" and "own," prompting contextual substitutions but still valuable for phraseological consistency.	7. Contextually, the specific translation for "Bolognese" and "Tübinger" remains accurate in field translation, with references following German culinary terms directly adapted for appreciation rather than literal transcription.
baktik → Bäckkiste → gebatikt  	jewellery → Schmiergelder → Schmuckstücke  	Roman → romisches → Römische-Mühle  		**Explanation:**  	- "Bäckkiste" is not a valid translation of "baktik." The correct term in this context is "gebatikt," which indicates the activity children could engage in.	- "Schmiergelder" (bribes) is a mistranslation of "jewellery." It doesn't fit the intended meaning, causing significant contextual inaccuracy. The correct term is "Schmuckstücke."	- "romisches" (Roman) is incorrect in this context because it doesn't convey the specific type of traditional children's game referred to in German as "Römische-Mühle," which is different and culturally specific compared to just any "Roman" game. Thus, a more appropriate term would be "Römische-Mühle."
fishing → Fischerei → Angeln  	pond → Becken → Teich  	fire → Kamper → Feuer  		**Explanation:** 	- "Fischerei" (fishery) is a mistranslation of "fishing"; "Angeln" is the correct term for recreational fishing.	- "Becken" (basin) is a mistranslation of "pond"; "Teich" accurately reflects a small body of water.	- "Kamper" appears to be a typographical error or mistranslation for "campfire"; "Feuer" (fire) captures the intended meaning in context.
sun → Sonne → keinen	go → schmelzte → lachte	headed → kamen → kehrten
Haigerloch → Hagerloch → Haigerloch  	gates → Toren → Pforte  	mercy → Gnade → Barmherzigkeit  		**Explanation:** "Hagerloch" appears to be a typo of "Haigerloch". "Toren" (gates) does not match "Pforte" (gate/door) from the reference, which was directly mentioned in the source as singular "gates", indicating a singular concept is meant. "Gnade" (grace/mercy) does not match "Barmherzigkeit" (compassion/mercy) which is the more precise term in a religious or mercy-related context, as per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
ministrants → Minister → Ministranten  	chaplaincy → Kapitemie → Seelsorgeeinheit  		**Explanation:** "Minister" is a mistranslation of "ministrants," changing the intended meaning as it refers to government officials rather than religious assistants. "Kapitemie" does not accurately convey the context of "chaplaincy," leading to confusion about the organizational structure. The most significant words were extracted to align with the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Sie haben vier Etappen zusammen abgedeckt" aligns well with the source sentence "They covered four stages together." The key elements—"four stages" (vier Etappen) and "together" (zusammen)—are correctly translated. Both "abgedeckt" and "bewältigt" can be considered valid translations of "covered" in this context, given their use in German to describe completing or addressing stages. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
1. ministrants → Minister → Ministranten  		**Explanation:** "Minister" is a significant mistranslation of "ministrants". While "Ministranten" refers to young assistants in church services, "Minister" refers to government officials, which changes the context and meaning of the sentence.		2. continue → weiterführen → Durchführung   		**Explanation:** "Continue" was translated as "weiterführen", while "Durchführung" (execution) is the more accurate translation for the given context. "Weiterführen" implies continuing an existing action, whereas here it refers to conducting or executing a new event (the pilgrimage), as reflected in the reference.
bishop's → keine Übersetzung → Bischofsstadt		**Explanation:** The source phrase "bishop's city of Freiburg" is specifically translated as "Bischofsstadt Freiburg" in the reference. The candidate translation lacks the direct equivalent of "bishop's" in the context of referencing the city. This oversight affects the specific identification of Freiburg as a city with ecclesiastical significance, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
children → Kinder → Minis		**Explanation:** The reference translation uses the term "Minis" which is a specific term potentially indicating a group, like "Minis" might refer to members of a youth group or a special context distinguishing it from the generic "Kinder" (children) used in the candidate translation. Since this changes the context implied by the sentence, it aligns with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "werden auf die Straße gesetzt" translates back to "were placed on the street," a clear divergence from "set off" as intended. However, the key focus for single-word level is "Minis" instead of "children."
previous → vorherigen → zuvor  	set → aufgestellt → sandte  	blessed → hat → segnete  	cross → Kreuz → Pilgerkreuze  
Cathedral → Kathedrale → Münster  	Lady → Lady → Lieben  		**Explanation:** "Kathedrale" is a correct word in German, but "Münster" is more contextually accurate for "Cathedral" in this reference. "Lady" is a direct translation but does not match "Lieben" from the reference for "Our Lady," indicating the cultural adaptation needed for "Unsere Lieben Frau." Both these differences follow the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, requiring corrections for appropriate cultural and contextual significance.
individual → einzelnen → einzelnen  	trips → Tagesreisen → Tagestouren  	framed → geprägt → umrahmt  	brief → kurzen → kurzen  	moments → Augenblicken → Impuls  	prayers → Gebetern → Gebeten  	written → schriftlichen → Schrift  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Tagesreisen" (day trips) is a mistranslation of "Tagestouren", as both are potential translations but "Tagestouren" is more contextually appropriate.	2. "geprägt" (shaped) does not properly convey the meaning of "framed" as "umrahmt" does in the given context.	3. "Augenblicken" (moments) is mistranslated from "Impuls", which captures the specific concept in the sentence better.	4. "Gebetern" is a mistranslation of "Gebeten", which uses the correct plural form "Gebeten".	5. "schriftlichen" (written) is a mistranslation of "Schrift", as the reference suggests the use of "Schrift" in the context implies fixed or recognized texts, which is subtly distinct.
- even → selbst → aber auch  	- out and about → herausgekommen → unterwegs  	- took breaks → haben... Pausen genommen → machten... Rast  	- wayside → an den Wegstrecken → Feldkreuzen  	- to sing → zum Lied → um... zu singen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "selbst" translates as "even" in a different context, while "aber auch" fits the intended nuance of continuity or exceptionality.	2. "herausgekommen" (came out) does not capture the ongoing "out and about" concept in "unterwegs" (on the way).	3. "haben... Pausen genommen" is an awkward rendering of "took breaks," whereas "machten... Rast" accurately captures the intended meaning.	4. "an den Wegstrecken" corresponds to "at the route sections," not specifically "wayside" as "Feldkreuzen" (wayside crosses) suggests.	5. "zum Lied" (to the song) loses the action of singing, which "um... zu singen" (to sing) preserves.
rectory → Verzeichnis → Pfarrheime  	parish → Parisole → Pfarreien  		**Explanation:** "Verzeichnis" (directory or list) is a mistranslation of "rectory", which refers to a residence for clergy, such as "Pfarrheime" (parish homes). The error changes the intended meaning as it refers to a living space, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "Parisole" appears to be a potential mistranslation or misspelling of "parish", which should instead be translated as "Pfarreien", following the **Identify Mistranslations** rule.
**(stage → Phase → Etappenzielen)**		**(delicious → erfreuliches → schmackhaftes/ Abendessen)**		**Explanation:** 	- "Phase" (phase) is not an appropriate translation for "stage" in this context, where it should refer to a specific point or segment, more akin to "Etappenzielen" (stages or goals).	- "erfreuliches" (pleasant) does not convey the same degree of tastefulness as "delicious" does. "Schmackhaftes" (tasty) directly addresses taste, which aligns with "delicious." Additionally, the context of "dinner" (Abendessen) specifies the notion of a delicious meal, which is missed in "pleasant" (erfreuliches).
Furtwangen → Weitwangen → Furtwangen  		**Explanation:** "Weitwangen" is a mistranslation of "Furtwangen". This changes the intended meaning of the route taken, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The place name in the source should be accurately maintained in the translation.
sweltering → Hitze → schwüler	climb → ansteigen → erklommen	descend → abgleiten → abgestiegen		**Explanation:** The word "sweltering" is better translated as "schwüler" rather than just "Hitze", which does not convey the oppressive aspect of "sweltering". "Climb" is mistranslated as "ansteigen" (rise), whereas "erklommen" (climbed) is more accurate. "Descend" is mistranslated as "abgleiten" (glide), whereas "abgestiegen" (descend) more accurately captures the intended meaning. Both issues violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
earned → sich → verdiente  	barbecueing → zu kreuzen → Grillen  	swimming pond → Schwimmbecken → Badweiher  		**Explanation:**  	- "sich" (reflexive) in the candidate translation is a mistranslation of "earned" because it doesn't accurately convey the action described. The reference uses "verdiente" to reflect the action of earning the reward.	- "zu kreuzen" (to cruise) is a mistranslation of "barbecueing", which changes the activity significantly. The intended action of grilling is lost.	- "Schwimmbecken" (swimming pool) is a mistranslation of "swimming pond", as a "pond" typically refers to a natural body of water, unlike a "pool". The reference correctly uses "Badweiher".
session → Schwestern → Morgenimpuls  	cloisters → Schwestern → Klosterkirche  		**Explanation:** "Schwestern" (sisters) is a mistranslation in both contexts. Firstly, "session" was intended to refer to a gathering or event, similar to "Morgenimpuls" (morning impulse or session). Secondly, "cloisters" refers to a part of a convent or monastery and should have been translated as "Klosterkirche" (monastic church). Both explain why "Schwestern" is incorrect in context, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While the candidate translation differs from the reference, it still conveys the essential meaning. Phrases like "Freiburger Münster" and "Kathedrale von Freiburg", or "gingen" and "durchschritten" are different expressions but maintain the same context. The translation respects the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules since these variations do not significantly change the meaning of the sentence as a whole.
moment → Augenblick → Impuls		**Explanation:** "Augenblick" (moment) is a mistranslation of "Impuls" (impulse), which changes the nuance of the sentence. In the context of thanking, "Impuls" refers to a brief but meaningful act of gratitude, reflecting the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it alters the intended expression.
No translation errors detected.
service → Dienst → Gottesdienst  	sacristry → Heiligkeit → Sakristei  		**Explanation:** "Dienst" (service) could generally mean "service" but in the context of religious service, "Gottesdienst" is more appropriate. "Heiligkeit" (holiness) is an incorrect translation of "sacristry", which in this context should be "Sakristei". These mistranslations significantly change the intended meaning, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation adequately reflects the meaning of the source sentence. Although there are some differences in the structure and word choice compared to the reference, the candidate translation conveys the same essential information without introducing significant translation errors. There are no single-word errors that alter the overall meaning in a significant way according to the given context.
took → brachten → ging  		**Explanation:** "brachten" (brought) is a mistranslation of "took". This significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, as "bringing" the train suggests the subjects made the train come back, rather than them traveling by train back to Horb. This violation highlights the importance of **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**, as the action described is incorrect.
spirituality → Spiritualität → Spiritualität		Explanation: There are no mistranslations related to "spirituality" as it remains consistent across the sentences.		camaraderie → Kameradie → Gemeinschaftserlebnis		Explanation: "Kameradie" appears to be an attempt to translate "camaraderie," but it is not a correct German word. The correct term should be "Gemeinschaftserlebnis," which aligns with the reference translation. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Kameradie" is not understandable in German.		strong → ausgeprägten → starken		Explanation: "ausgeprägten" means "pronounced" or "distinct", while "starken" directly translates to "strong." Despite both being similar, the context intended a sense of strength rather than distinctiveness, hence not aligning perfectly with the reference, thus altering the intended meaning.
Scot → Schottischer → Schotte  	storms → Stürme → stürmt  	home → [missing] → nach Hause  	Brits → Grabstoffkreislauf → Brite  	grab → Grabstoffkreislauf → erringt  	cycling → Grabstoffkreislauf → Radsport  	gold → [missing] → Gold  		**Explanation:**  	- "Schottischer" (Scottish) is a mistranslation of "Scot", which should instead be "Schotte".	- "Stürme" (storms, as in plural storms) is mistranslated; it should be "stürmt" in the context of someone storming to victory.	- The concept of "home" is missing from the candidate translation and is present in both the source and reference.	- "Grabstoffkreislauf" is not a valid translation for "Brits", "grab", or "cycling", distorting the meaning intended in the source. Each of these words should be translated to "Brite", "erringt", and "Radsport" respectively.	- The word "gold" does not appear in the candidate translation and is a significant part of the original meaning.
1. raced → geschlagen → raste		**Explanation:** "geschlagen" translates to "defeated" or "beaten," which does not accurately capture the intended meaning of "raced" in the context provided. The correct translation, "raste," accurately conveys the sense of speed and competition in the reference translation. This adheres to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by ensuring that the racing context is correctly translated.
23-year-old → 23-Jährige → 23-Jähriger  	was → befanden → nahm  	made → genommen → gemacht  	proud → stolz → stolz  	youngster → Jüngere → Jungspund  	he → er → er  	stormed → Heimkehr → stürmte  	snatch → Nadelsieg → einzuheimsen  	outfit → Aufwands → Neuseeland  		**Explanation:**  	- "23-Jährige" (female form) is incorrect for "23-year-old" (male form), whereas "23-Jähriger" is the correct reference. This adheres to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule due to gender-specific translation sensitivity in German.	- "befanden" (were) mistranslates the active "was" which should be "nahm" (took/occupied), changing the action dynamics.	- "genommen" (taken) is a mistranslation for "made," which should be "gemacht" (made), affecting the meaning of how Chris Hoy's role was defined.	- "stolz" in itself isn't incorrect, but contextually here "tat die Legende stolz" is awkward, implying action rather than state; the focus is on more fluid wording, so it's just noted.	- "Jüngere" (more recent/younger) fails to capture the nuance of "youngster", which the reference's "Jungspund" does, being more culturally relevant.	- "er" (he) is correctly mapped, but context syntax isn't addressed here.	- "Heimkehr" (homecoming) is incorrect for "stormed" (dynamically moved quickly), which is better captured by "stürmte".	- "Nadelsieg" (needle victory) is not the correct translation for "snatch," which contextually means "take quickly," represented by "einzuheimsen".	- "Aufwands" (effort) mistranslates "outfit," a term implying team or group, meant as "Neuseeland," indicating the New Zealand team.
claimed → gefordert → beanspruchte  	fifth → Fünftel → fünfte  	to win → weil → während  		**Explanation:** 		1. The word "claimed" is mistranslated as "gefordert" (demanded), which does not convey the meaning of "taking" or "winning" as implied in the reference with "beanspruchte" (claimed), adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	   	2. The word "fifth" is mistranslated as "Fünftel" (a fifth, meaning one-fifth), which changes the meaning significantly from "fünfte" (fifth), according to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, and given the context of ordinal numerization relevant to medals. 		3. The phrase "to win" is a purpose clause providing causal linkage to Hoy's actions, but "weil" (because) in the candidate changes this intended meaning significantly from the purpose or simultaneous action expressed by "während" (while), following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
March's → März → März	lowly → kleinen → bescheidenen	sixth → sechsten → sechsten	Track World Championships → sechsten Weltmeisterschaft → Bahn-Weltmeisterschaften	retired → in den Ruhestand getreten → Rücktritt		**Explanation:**		1. **March's → März → März**: "März" is correctly translated from "March's" according to the reference.		2. **lowly → kleinen → bescheidenen**: "kleinen" is a mistranslation of "lowly", which should imply a humble or less prestigious position, best captured by "bescheidenen". This is significant as it changes the intended description of the sixth place.		3. **sixth → sechsten → sechsten**: "sechsten" aligns correctly with the reference.		4. **Track World Championships → sechsten Weltmeisterschaft → Bahn-Weltmeisterschaften**: "sechsten Weltmeisterschaft" is a mistranslation of "Track World Championships". "Bahn-Weltmeisterschaften" correctly specifies the type of event, which is significant.		5. **retired → in den Ruhestand getreten → Rücktritt**: "in den Ruhestand getreten" is an acceptable translation of "retired", though "Rücktritt" offers a more succinct reference, no significant meaning shift is detected here, thus no error is recorded.		Errors are identified for "lowly" and "Track World Championships", as these would lead to different interpretations of the sentence.
issue → Frage → Problem  	specialist → Fachpersonal → Anfahrers  	starter → Fachpersonal → Anfahrers  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Frage" (question) is a mistranslation of "issue", which should be "Problem" to convey the intended meaning, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Fachpersonal" (specialist personnel) incorrectly translates both "specialist" and "starter". The reference correctly identifies "starter" as "Anfahrers", indicating the specific role, which follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it changes the context and role being referred to in the sentence.
emerged → auftraten → auftauchte  		**Explanation:** "auftraten" (performed) is a mistranslation of "emerged." This significantly changes the action being described. According to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, the correct word should reflect the appearance or emergence of Hindes, not a performance.
retirement → Ruhestand → Hoys Ruhestand  	void → Vakuum → Lücke  	fill → füllen → schließen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Ruhestand" (retirement) is technically correct, but the possessive form "Hoys Ruhestand" is missing, which provides important context. However, given the focus on single-word errors, this does not need to be listed as an error in this task specifically.	- "Vakuum" (vacuum) is a mistranslation of "void". While they can be synonyms in certain contexts, "Vakuum" here implies a literal vacuum, whereas "Lücke" (gap or void) is more appropriate for a metaphorical sense, fulfilling the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "füllen" (fill) is a more literal translation of "fill" but does not fit the context as appropriately as "schließen" (close). In this context, "schließen" better conveys the idea of filling a role or void someone left behind, fulfilling the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
man → Busse → Mann  	coaches → Busse → Trainer  		**Explanation:** "Busse" is a mistranslation, which is intended to mean "coaches" (i.e., trainers) in the sports context but incorrectly assigns the vehicle meaning. The source "man" is mistranslated as "Busse", deviating from the correct "Mann" to refer to Skinner. Both errors violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules by altering the sentence's intended meaning.
champions → Champions → siegten  	Hoy → Hy → Hoy  	qualifying → Qualifizierung → Qualifikationsrunden  	standard → Standard → Neuseeländer  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Champions" in the candidate is not contextually accurate as compared to the source's intent of action (siegten - won), which follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.  	2. "Hy" is a clear mistranslation of "Hoy" due to apparent typo or misunderstanding of the word.  	3. "Qualifizierung" (qualification) is too generic and doesn't capture the intent of "Qualifikationsrunden" (qualifying rounds), which is a finer distinction made in the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.  	4. "Standard" in the candidate translation does not convey the intended meaning of "Neuseeländer" (New Zealand) who overtook the standard, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
trio → der → das  		**Explanation:** "der" (masculine singular article) is a mistranslation of "trio", which should be "das" (neuter singular article) to agree in gender with "Trio" in the reference translation. This falls under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Trio" is correctly a neuter noun in German.
Hindes → die Hinde → Hindes  	lap → Einmarsch → Runde  	team → Mannschaft → Team  	in front → vor Gericht → nach vorne  		**Explanation:**  	1. "die Hinde" (the hind) is a mistranslation of "Hindes," which is a proper noun (a name) and should not be translated.	2. "Einmarsch" (entry/invasion) does not convey the intended meaning of "lap," which should be "Runde."	3. While "Mannschaft" is often synonymous with "team," in this context, "Team" is more appropriate to maintain the original term and context.	4. "vor Gericht" (in court) is a mistranslation of "in front," which should be "nach vorne" indicating movement to the front.
Hindes → Hinden → Hindes  	gear → Tempo → Gang  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Hinden" is an incorrect translation of "Hindes." This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes the name of the person involved in the context.	2. "Tempo" (speed) is a mistranslation of "gear" (Gang), as the passage refers to the physical gear on a bicycle, not speed. This is an error according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it significantly affects the understanding of the strategy being described.
Hoy → Hoch → Hoy  	pundit → Pritit → Experte  	caught → griff → fiel  		**Explanation:**  	- "Hoy" is mistranslated as "Hoch" which follows the **Identify Mistranslations** rule since the name does not need translation.	- "Pritit" is not a valid translation of "pundit" whereas "Experte" is, violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by using a non-existent word instead of the correct profession term.	- "griff" means "grab" which misrepresents "caught" in this context, as "fiel" (caught the attention of) fits better with the intended meaning, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation is identical to the reference translation. Each word corresponds correctly to its source, maintaining the intended meaning without any significant changes or contextual inaccuracies. This satisfies the requirements for **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
myself → persönlich → mir  	name → benennen → Namen  		**Explanation:** "persönlich" (personally) is an incorrect translation of "myself" in this context where "mir" (to myself) is more appropriate. "benennen" (to name) does not accurately capture the idiomatic expression "make a name for myself", which should result in "Namen" (name) as per the reference. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as these mistranslations significantly alter the meaning.
final → Endeffekt → Endrunde		**Explanation:** "Endeffekt" (in the end) is a mistranslation of "final" (in the context of a sports competition), which should be translated as "Endrunde". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Endeffekt" does not convey the idea of a competitive final round in sports.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In German, "Das war" (that was) and "Es war" (it was) can both convey the intended meaning without significantly altering the sentiment or understanding. The phrase "einfach unglaublich" accurately translates "just incredible" in both the candidate and reference translations, and aligns with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Es gibt keinen besseren Weg, ihn zu gewinnen." and the reference "Es gibt keine bessere Art dies zu gewinnen." both convey the intended meaning of the source sentence. "Weg" (way) and "Art" (manner) are acceptable variations, as are "ihn" (it) and "dies" (this). The translation retains the intended nuance, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules. Thus, there are no translation errors to report.
triumphing → triumphiert → Triumph  	track → Weg → Bahn  		**Explanation:** "triumphiert" (triumphed) does not match "triumphing" in terms of grammatical structure. The reference "Triumph" signifies a noun rather than a verb, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule. "Weg" (way) is a mistranslation of "track", significantly altering the intended meaning in context, aligning with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
comment → Bemerkung → Aussage  	appeal → Berufungsmethode → Einspruch  		**Explanation:** "Bemerkung" (remark) is a weaker term compared to "Aussage" (statement), which is more appropriate for the context. "Berufungsmethode" (method of appeal) is a mistranslation for "Einspruch" (objection/appeal), as the latter captures the context of a lack of response from rivals.
issue → Thema → Problem  	supreme → Obersieg → überragendem Sieg  		**Explanation:** "Thema" (theme/topic) is a mistranslation of "issue", which significantly changes the meaning in the context of addressing problems. "Obersieg" is not a correct translation of "supreme victory"; "überragendem Sieg" fits the context better, aligning with the intended meaning.
Position → Position → Tribüne		**Explanation:** The mistranslation of "stand" as "Position" does not convey the intended meaning of "Tribüne" (stand, referring to a seating area in a stadium or similar venue). This error significantly alters the location being described, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source sentence. The order of words slightly differs from the reference, but this does not constitute a significant meaning change or mistranslation as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Both translations accurately express the idea of the team coming together in the last three months.
losing → verloren → schlecht weggekommen  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "verloren" (lost), which alters the context from missing opportunities to actively failing, as suggested by "schlecht weggekommen" (did badly). This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule due to the significant change in meaning.
seven → Trassen → Titeln  		**Explanation:** "Trassen" (routes) is a mistranslation of "titles" in the context of track events. This word does not fit the intended meaning of sports titles or championships and thus violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
progress → Fortschritte → Fortschritts  	velodrome → Venodrom → Velodrom  	successful → Erfolg → erfolgreiche  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Fortschritte" (progresses) in the candidate should be "Fortschritts" (progress), matching the singular intent of the sentence. This change impacts the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	2. "Venodrom" is a clear typographical error of "velodrome" or "Velodrom", which changes the meaning of the sentence and violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	3. "Erfolg" (success) instead of "erfolgreiche" (successful) changes the grammatical structure and meaning of the sentence. The **Identify Mistranslations** rule is triggered here as the change impacts the understanding of the sentence's conclusion.
realms → unmöglich → im Bereich des Möglichen	form → hat → Form	game → Spiel → Wettbewerb		**Explanation:** 	1. "unmöglich" (impossible) is a mistranslation of "realms of possibility". The correct translation is "im Bereich des Möglichen" (within the realm of possibility), maintaining the intended meaning.	2. "hat" (has) does not correctly translate the word "form" as seen in the reference translation, where "Form" is the proper noun used.	3. "Spiel" (game) is a mistranslation of "Games" in the context of the Olympic Games. The correct term is "Wettbewerb" (competition), referring to the Olympic context specifically.
Steve Redgrave → Steve Redgrad → Steve Redgrave  	tally → Distanz → Ausbeute  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Steve Redgrad" is a clear typo and mistranslation of "Steve Redgrave". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it inaccurately represents the name of a well-known individual.  	2. "Distanz" (distance) is a mistranslation of "tally". In this context, the sentence refers to Kenny's collection of medals, not a physical distance. Thus, it corrects to "Ausbeute" (yield/haul), aligning with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Das wäre das Gleiche wie Hoy 's." effectively conveys the meaning of "That would be the same as Hoy's" in German. The structure and vocabulary used in the candidate translation do not change the intended meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Kenny → Bekannte → Kenny  	competes → Wettkämpfe → teilnimmt  	sprint → Spurt → Sprint  		**Explanation:**  		1. "Bekannte" (famous/known) is a mistranslation of "Kenny". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule due to changing the subject of the sentence.		2. "Wettkämpfe" (competitions) is not a correct translation of "competes". The correct translation should convey the action of participating rather than referring to competitions themselves. 		3. "Spurt" (spurt) is a less accurate translation of "sprint", which in this context is more aptly described as "Sprint", directly translating the concept of a track event. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule to highlight the primary translation error.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although the candidate uses "freue mich" where the reference uses "genieße", both expressions convey a sense of enjoyment in this context. Additionally, "zunächst einmal" and "nur für den Moment" both imply a sense of temporary enjoyment. Given that the meaning of the sentence is retained, this follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, and no erroneous single-word translations were found.
team event → Team → Team-Ereignis  		**Explanation:** "Team" (team) is a mistranslation of "team event" ("Team-Ereignis"). The candidate sentence does not include the concept of an event, significantly changing the meaning. This complies with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, focusing on the word-level error "team".
mates → Kampfen → Kollegen  		**Explanation:** "Kampfen" (combats/fights) is a mistranslation of "mates", which refers to friends or colleagues. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "mates" signifies companionship, not combat.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essence of loneliness and honesty associated with winning on one's own. Although it is differently worded, it does not significantly change the meaning when compared to the reference. Therefore, no meaningful single-word translation errors are identified.
Hindes → Hinde → Hindes  	said → sagten → sagte  	knighthood → Kniefall → Ritter
day's → medaille → Medaillenwettbewerb  		**Explanation:** "medaille" (medal) is a mistranslation for the concept of 'medal event' in this context. "Medaillenwettbewerb" (medal competition) is the correct translation, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "medaille" alone doesn't convey the event aspect.
fastest → am schnellsten → mit der schnellsten Leistung  	pursuit → Mannschafts-Mannschaft → Rennen  		**Explanation:** "am schnellsten" (fastest) incorrectly translates the concept of team performance in "four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit" into individual speed; the correct context implies a team effort described as "mit der schnellsten Leistung" (with the fastest performance). For "pursuit," "Mannschafts-Mannschaft" (team team) is a mistranslation because it repeats the word for "team" and fails to convey the idea of a "race" or "pursuit," which is accurately translated as "Rennen" (race).
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence accurately renders the main elements of the source sentence into the target language. The key element, a time recorded as "3:51.943," is preserved, and the expression "schlossen mit" (finished with) is a valid translation choice. While "kamen am Ziel an" is another valid translation for "finished," they both capture the intended meaning sufficiently, falling under the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Comma-in-numbers convention difference does not change the meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate and reference translations effectively convey the intended meaning of the source sentence. The phrase "in Gold gewonnen wurde" and "Gold gewann" are both valid translations capturing the context of winning gold. Furthermore, the numerical formatting and other words are accurate. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
first → letzte → finale  		**Explanation:** "letzte" (last) in the candidate translation replaces "first" and "finale" (final) in the source and reference, affecting the sequence mentioned. The reference translation correctly places emphasis on the first and final round, which does not match the candidate translation's expression.
dispute → Streit → gestritten  	commissaires → Kommissaren → Beauftragten  	ride → Flug → Qualifikation  	height → Höhe → Körpergröße  		**Explanation:**  	- "Streit" (dispute) is a slight mistranslation of "gestritten" (argued) as the context implies an ongoing process rather than a static noun.	- "Kommissaren" (commissioners) is mistranslated for "Beauftragten" (officials or agents), highlighting different roles inaccurately. 	- "Flug" (flight) is incorrect for "Qualifikation" (qualification), which misrepresents the context of a competitive event rather than travel.	- "Höhe" (height in terms of altitude) is a mistranslation for "Körpergröße" (body height), which in this context refers to the measurement of a person's physical height.
Rowsel → Rowsell → Rowsell	Klatte → Klatte → Katie	Archibalt → Archibalt → Archibald	Milngave → Milngave → Milngavie	Weltmarktrekordzeit → Weltmarktrekordzeit → Weltrekordszeit		**Explanation:** 	1. "Rowsel Shand" should be "Rowsell Shand." Although a minor spelling error, it significantly changes the name.	2. "Klatte" is a mistranslation of "Katie," a significant error as it alters a proper noun.	3. "Archibalt" is incorrect for "Archibald," changing the meaning in terms of the person's name.	4. "Milngave" is incorrect for "Milngavie," modifying a proper noun and location.	5. "Weltmarktrekordzeit" (world market record time) is a mistranslation of "world record time," significantly altering the intended meaning.
rely → verlässt sich → verlässt sich  	mighty → mächtige → starkes  	track cycling squad → Fahrradfahrt → Bahnradteam  	ownership → Verantwortung → dominieren  	middle period → Mitte → mittlere Periode  	deliver → liefern → holen  		**Explanation:** 	- "verlässt sich" is correctly translated as "rely".	- "mächtige" (mighty) does not fully capture "starkes" in the specific context of a sports team, where "starkes" (strong) is more appropriate.	- "Fahrradfahrt" (bicycle ride) is a mistranslation of "track cycling squad" (Bahnradteam), as it completely changes the meaning from a specific sports team to a general activity.	- "Verantwortung" (responsibility) is a mistranslation of "ownership" in this context where "dominate" or "domination" is intended, not literal ownership.	- "Mitte" (middle) does not convey the temporal aspect of "middle period" (mittlere Periode).	- "liefern" (deliver) misses the nuance of "holen" which means to successfully achieve or win in the context of medals.
truly → wirklich → wahrlich  	showings → Vormachtstellungen → Darstellung  	played down → heruntergespielt → heruntergefahren  		**Explanation:** "wirklich" (really) is a mistranslation of "truly", which contextually translates to "wahrlich" (truly) when describing something exceptional. "Vormachtstellungen" (predominance) is a mistranslation of "showings," which, in this context, refers more closely to the concept of a "Darstellung" (presentation/showing). While "heruntergespielt" (played down) and "heruntergefahren" (ramped down) are similar, in context, "heruntergefahren" captures the gradual reduction of expectations rather than just playing them down.
technical director → technischen Direktorin → technischen Leiters  	bullying → Einschüchterungsversuchen → Mobbing  		**Explanation:** "technischen Direktorin" is a mistranslation of "technical director" as it improperly genders the position, showcasing the violation of the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule due to incorrect gender usage. "Einschüchterungsversuchen" (attempts to intimidate) is a mistranslation of "bullying", where the intended meaning refers to "Mobbing" (bullying), maintaining contextual accuracy. Both cases significantly change the intended meaning of the sentence.
1. racing → Abendwechsels → Wettbewerbs	2. velodrome → Abend → Velodrom	3. peaking → sprechen → seinen Höhepunkt erreicht		**Explanation:** 	1. "Abendwechsels" (evening change) is a mistranslation of "racing". In the context of the velodrome, "Wettbewerbs" (competition) is more accurate.	2. "Abend" (evening) is not the correct term for "velodrome", which is a specific venue for cycling, represented here by "Velodrom".	3. "sprechen" (speak) does not accurately capture "peaking" in this context, where "seinen Höhepunkt erreicht" (reached its peak) refers to achieving maximum performance.
smelter's → Portlandschmelzer → Schmelzerei  	axing → Lockerung → Aufhebung  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Portlandschmelzer" is a mistranslation of "smelter's". In this context, the correct translation should relate to the concept of a smelting facility, hence "Schmelzerei" is appropriate. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the candidate word does not fit the intended meaning.	2. "Lockerung" (loosening) is a mistranslation of "axing" (cancellation/termination). This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it significantly alters the nature of the action on the power contract. "Aufhebung" (termination) is the correct reference translation in this context.
1. power → Macht → Energieliefer		**Explanation:** "Machtunternehmen" (power company) should refer to an "Energielieferunternehmen" or similar expression related to an energy supplier context. The candidate translation changes the meaning significantly, as "Macht" can imply authority or force, which is contextually inaccurate.		2. disclosing → zur Offenlegung → mitteilte		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "zur Offenlegung" which means "to disclosure" rather than "mitteilte" (announced or disclosed). This selection alters the meaning of the sentence in context, as it incorrectly uses a noun-form for the intended action.		3. terminate → kündigen → kündigen/kündigt		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence uses "kündigen" correctly; however, since it's part of a larger mismatch involving subsequent phrases (in terms of sequence and structure), it can be misleading in this sentence structure.		Note: Some phrases such as "im Zweifel an dem" could be considered poorly structured or stylistically off, but they don't translate single words inaccurately on their own.
decision → Schritt → Entscheidung		**Explanation:** The word "Schritt" (step) is a mistranslation of "move", which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence. The intended meaning is to describe an action taken after a decision, rather than the decision itself. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, because it alters the sequence of events depicted in the sentence.
subsidy → Beihilfe → Subvention		**Explanation:** "Beihilfe" (assistance/aid) is a mistranslation of "subsidy". A subsidy is specifically a form of financial support usually provided by the government, while "Beihilfe" is more general. Thus, the substitution of "Beihilfe" for "subsidy" violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it does not specifically capture the meaning of "subsidy" as intended in the context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. The phrase "Bis 2000 können Arbeitsplätze im Portland-Werk von Alcoa gefährdet sein" is an acceptable translation of "Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant." Although the structure slightly differs from the reference translation, it does not introduce any significant change in meaning according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
2000 → [MISSING] → 2000		**Explanation:** The candidate translation omitted "2000", which is a significant figure indicating the potential number of jobs at risk. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because the omission changes the impact of the statement.
smelter → Slumerverbrauch → Schmelzerei
Point Henry → Point Henry → Point Henry Schmelzerei		**Explanation:** Although "Point Henry" is a proper noun, the word "Schmelzerei" (smelter) is omitted in the candidate translation. This changes the point of reference in terms of the facility type being discussed, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Therefore, "Point Henry" is flagged for missing "Schmelzerei".
Alcoa's → Alkoas → Alcoa  	smelter → Schmelzer → Schmelzerei  		**Explanation:**  	- "Alcoa's" is translated as "Alkoas," which technically is a possessive form but changes the corporate name. "Alcoa" should be used directly as is the norm for brand or proper names.	- "smelter" is mistranslated as "Schmelzer," which means "melter" (referring to a person who melts), rather than the intended "Schmelzerei," which refers to a facility for smelting. This alters the meaning significantly.
speculation → Spekulation → Spekulationen	moves → Bewegungen → Schritt	output → Produktion → Strompreises		**Explanation:** 	1. "Spekulation" (speculation) should be pluralized to "Spekulationen" as in the reference, to align with "the years" concept, maintaining the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Bewegungen" (movements) is a mistranslation of "moves", which should be "Schritt" (step). This is a significant change in meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	3. "Produktion" (production) is not accurate for "output" in the context, where "Strompreises" (price of electricity/power) is more accurate according to the reference. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it ensures the proper sense of the output being discussed.
Latrobe → Latrober → Latrobe  	smelter → Aluminiumschmelz → Aluminiumschmelzerei  	said → erwartete → teilte mit  		**Explanation:**  		1. "Latrober" is a mistranslation of "Latrobe". The reference uses "Latrobe", and this is a place name, so it should not change.		2. "Aluminiumschmelz" (aluminium smelter) is a mistranslation of "aluminium smelter" which should be translated to "Aluminiumschmelzerei" to accurately reflect the term "smelter". The distinction is important because "schmelz" is more of a process or act rather than an establishment or facility like a "smelter".		3. "erwartete" (expected) is a mistranslation of "said", which alters the intent of the statement. The reference uses "teilte mit", which translates directly to "said" or "announced", and aligns better with the source meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Das Werk ist mehrheitlich im Besitz eines gemeinsamen Unternehmens" and "Die Anlage befindet sich im mehrheitlichen Besitz einer Joint Venture" convey the sentence's meaning adequately. While "Werk" (plant) and "Anlage" (facility) are not exact matches, the context remains clear. The rest of the sentence, specifically the roles and ownership stakes by "Chinas CITIC und Japans Marubeni Corp," are effectively translated. Thus, no significant translation errors exist according to the specified output format and rules.
facility → Fazilität → Anlage  	smelter → Slumer → Schmelzerei  		**Explanation:** "Fazilität" is a direct but incorrect translation of "facility" in this context, as "Anlage" is the more appropriate term. Similarly, "Slumer" is not a correct translation for "smelter"; the correct term should be "Schmelzerei". Both errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by introducing terms that do not convey the intended meaning correctly.
contracts → Verträge → Sicherungsgeschäfte		**Explanation:** While "Verträge" (contracts) is a direct translation, the term "Sicherungsgeschäfte" in the reference is more specific and aligned with the financial context of "hedging contracts". This error changes the specificity and intended meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Kündigungsfrist → Frist → termination period  	enden → abgeschlossen → finish  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Frist" (period) is a mistranslation of "termination period." The term "Kündigungsfrist" is specific to contracts and refers directly to the time allowed for termination, significantly changing the meaning if omitted.	2. "abgeschlossen" (completed) changes the intended meaning of "finish," which in this context should be rendered as "enden" (end), aligning better with the reference and conveying the idea of reaching the conclusion of the period. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
As such → Als solche → Von daher  	power company → Kraftwerk → Stromlieferant		**Explanation:** "Als solche" (as such) is a mistranslation of "Von daher" (therefore). In this context, "Von daher" is used to imply a conclusion drawn from previous statements and is more contextually appropriate. "Kraftwerk" (power plant) is a mistranslation of "power company". The reference correctly uses "Stromlieferant", which means "electricity supplier," representing the company rather than a physical plant.
potential → möglichen → potenzielle  	earnings → Einnahmeauswirkungen → Auswirkungen auf die Einnahmen  	FY18 → 18 → GJ 18  	futures → Zukunftsaussichten → Terminmärkte  		**Explanation:**  		- "möglichen" is a mistranslation of "potential". The correct word in context is "potenzielle", as seen in the reference translation.	- "Einnahmeauswirkungen" (impact on earnings) is a more specific phrase compared to the reference's "Auswirkungen auf die Einnahmen" (impact on the income), indicating a translation error in isolating "earnings".	- "18" in the candidate is incorrect for "FY18". The reference uses "GJ 18" (Geschäftsjahr 18, fiscal year 18), which is more contextually accurate.	- "Zukunftsaussichten" (futures outlook) was incorrectly used for "futures market", where "Terminmärkte" (futures markets) is the correct term as per the reference.
termination event → Endtermin → Kündigung		**Explanation:** "Endtermin" (end date/term) is a mistranslation of "termination event". The correct translation would reflect the idea of a cancellation or ending of a contract, which is captured by "Kündigung". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because "Endtermin" changes the meaning and implications related to the contract's cessation.
(Alcoa → Alkoa → Alcoas)	(smelter → Unterschlupf → Schmelzerei)	(secure → Sicherheit → gewährleisten)		**Explanation:** 	1. "Alcoa" is mistranslated as "Alkoa", which is likely a typographical error. The correct reference retains "Alcoa" as part of "Alcoas".	2. "smelter" is mistranslated as "Unterschlupf" (shelter), which significantly alters the context about the industrial plant being discussed.	3. "secure" in the sense of guarantee or ensure is mistranslated to "Sicherheit" (safety/security in another context). The correct context is about ensuring or supplying the electricity, which is correctly translated as "gewährleisten".
Loy Yang → Loy Jang → Loy Yang		**Explanation:** "Jang" is a mistranslation of "Yang", which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it incorrectly alters a proper noun. This is an important error since proper nouns typically do not change between languages.
(Analysts → Analysten → Analytiker)  	(economics → Wirtschaftsführung → wirtschaftlichen Verhältnisse)  		**Explanation:** "Analysten" is a mistranslation of "Analysts", as the more appropriate translation in this context would be "Analytiker", which aligns directly with the reference translation. "Wirtschaftsführung" (management) is a mistranslation of "economics". The context suggests "wirtschaftlichen Verhältnisse" (economic conditions) instead, as it better captures the economic challenges discussed.
uses → an Macht → an Strom		**Explanation:** The word "Macht" (power, authority) is a mistranslation of "uses" in this context. The intended word should refer to "Strom" (electricity) since the sentence is discussing electricity consumption, not authority or influence. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Each word in the candidate translation corresponds appropriately with the source and reference sentences. The words used capture the original meaning, and slight variations in the expression, such as "deutliche Reduzierung" vs "erhebliche Verringerung," do not significantly alter the intended meaning, thus following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses a structure and words that convey the intended meaning from the source sentence. "Generator" can be interpreted in the context of "Stromerzeuger," and the broader structure captures the same implication of consequence specified in the source and reference. There are no single words here that disrupt the meaning enough to be marked wrong, thus aligning with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
Kardashian → Kardashianer → Kardashian  	reality TV → Realitätsstar TV → Reality-TV  	cover → im → auf dem Cover  		**Explanation:** "Kardashianer" is a mistranslation of "Kardashian" as it unnecessarily transforms the name into a different form. "Realitätsstar TV" translates inaccurately for "reality TV," changing the meaning and structure. "Im" (in) instead of "auf dem Cover" (on the cover) shifts the intended position, causing a contextual error.
- model → Modelle → Model	- manager → Mutter → Managerin	- Kris's → Kris → Kris (Note: the error is structural, not word-level here)	- US Vogue → von den USA gehaltenen → US Vogue	- issue → Frage → Ausgabe		**Explanation:**	1. **model → Modelle → Model**: The candidate uses "Modelle" (plural for models), while the source and reference use "Model" (singular), which aligns with Kendall Jenner as a single model.	2. **manager → Mutter → Managerin**: The reference clarifies Kris's dual role as a mother and manager, with "Managerin" being more accurate than just "Mutter".	3. **US Vogue → von den USA gehaltenen → US Vogue**: The phrase "von den USA gehaltenen" is incorrect, deviating from the intended meaning of the "US Vogue."	4. **issue → Frage → Ausgabe**: "Frage" (question) is incorrect for "issue" in this context. "Ausgabe" (edition) is the correct term, referring to a magazine-themed concept.
Estee Lauder → Estee Lauder → Estee Lauder  	walked → gereist → lief  	the → die → die  	news → Nachrichten → Neuigkeiten  	account → Bericht → Konto  		**Explanation:**  	- "Estee Lauder" is consistent across all translations, no error noted here.  	- "walked" is mistranslated as "gereist" (traveled), which changes the activity from walking to traveling. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the original sentence refers to modeling, not traveling.  	- "the" and "die" match in definite article usage, so there is no error.  	- "news" is translated as "Nachrichten" (news in general) instead of "Neuigkeiten" (specific news or updates) which shifts the focus slightly but importantly.	- "account" is mistranslated as "Bericht" (report), while "Konto" would be accurate. This fits **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** because it changes the medium of announcement.
bunch → Haufen → voller  	people → Menschen → Leute  	cover → Deckmantel → Anblick/Covers  	cry → rief → Weinen  		**Explanation:** "Haufen" (heap) is a mistranslation of "bunch" which was more accurately translated as "voller" (full of). "Menschen" (humans) is an incorrect translation for "people" in this context, where "Leute" (people) is more fitting. "Deckmantel" is literally an "overcoat", which is a mistranslation of "cover" that refers to a visual element here, better captured as "Anblick" or directly as "Covers". Lastly, "rief" (called) does not convey the meaning of "cry" in the emotional sense intended in this context, where "Weinen" (to cry) is appropriate.
cover → Enthüllungen → Covers  	revelation → Enthüllungen → Enthüllung  	bizarre → Kalte → bizarres  	scripted → abgedrucktes → geskriptetes  	video → Realitätsvideo → Reality-Video  	bar → Bar → mit Ausnahme  	troublemakers → troublekers → Problemfälle  	Caitlyn → Caitlin → Caitlyn  	everyone's favourite → an der sich jeder beliebte → allseits beliebtesten  	showbiz uncle → Showbiz → Showbiz-Onkels  	Keeping Up producer → Keping up up produzent → Produzenten von Keeping Up  	cover → Schwesterdecke → Cover ihrer Schwester  	twist → Zwischenfall → Wendung
plot line → Broschüre → Handlung  	episode → Geburtstagsgeschenk → Episode  	Seacrest → Sacarest → Seacrest  	rabbit → Karikaturanstachels → Zeichentrickkaninchens  	timeslot → Timest. → Sendeplatz  		**Explanation:**  	- "Broschüre" (brochure) is a mistranslation of "plot line". This clearly violates the meaning, as a 'brochure' is not relevant to the context of a storyline in a show.  	- "Geburtstagsgeschenk" (birthday gift) is an incorrect translation of "episode". This changes the context entirely, as the sentence discusses a plot within an episode, not a gift.  	- "Sacarest" appears to be a typographical or transcription error for "Seacrest". Being the name of a person, any error here is significant.  	- "Karikaturanstachels" is a nonsensical term which does not relate to "rabbit". The context of an animated show featuring a cartoon rabbit is not honored here.	- "Timest." is likely a mangled abbreviation or error, while "timeslot" clearly refers to a programming schedule and is accurately translated as "Sendeplatz".
spot → Punkt → Hinblick  	Voge → Voge-Frage → Vogue  	issue → Frage → Ausgabe  		**Explanation:** "Punkt" (point) is a mistranslation of "spot", which in this context refers to a feature or placement, not a literal point or dot. "Voge-Frage" (Voge-question) is a significant mistranslation of "Vogue", which is the name of a magazine, not related to questions. "Frage" (question) is also a mistranslation of "issue", which refers to the specific edition of the magazine, not a question or inquiry. These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule and the overall understanding of the sentence.
big → große → große  	beaten → geschlagen → geschlagen  	to → bis → was das ... angeht  	cover → Sumpf → Cover  	Kanye → Kane → Kanye  	Abdeckung → Cover → Cover  	Zeitschrift → Zeitschrift → Septemberausgabe  		**Explanation:**  	- "big" is correctly translated as "große".	- "beaten" is correctly translated as "geschlagen".	- "to" is mistranslated as "bis", which changes the meaning. It should be "was das ... angeht" (regarding).	- "cover" is mistranslated as "Sumpf" (swamp), which changes the meaning entirely. The correct translation is "Cover".	- "Kanye" is mistranslated as "Kane", which is an incorrect name. It should be corrected back to "Kanye".	- "Abdeckung" is an unnecessary literal translation of "cover" in this context. The correct phrase is "Cover".	- "Zeitschrift" in "die Abdeckung der Zeitschrift im September" does not clearly indicate the September issue, which is relevant here. The phrase should be "Septemberausgabe".
September Issue → September-Affäre → Septemberausgabe  	edition → Verkaufsausgabe → Ausgabe		**Explanation:** "September-Affäre" (September affair) is a mistranslation of "September Issue", which is correctly translated as "Septemberausgabe." This changes the meaning significantly and violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Additionally, "Verkaufsausgabe" (sales edition) is not the correct translation for "edition," which should simply be "Ausgabe." This incorrect translation changes the context of the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
thickness → Dicke → Umfang  	coffee table book → Kaffeebuch → Bildband  	fashion magazine → Modemagazine → Modezeitschrift  	issue → Thema → Ausgabe  	advertisers → Werbung → Werbetreibenden  	tome → Seitenbogs → Wälzers  
revelation → Enthüllung → Enthüllung  	its → ihres → seines  	cover → Deckstars → Coverstars  	hotly → heiß → sehnsüchtig  	announcement → Ankündigung → Bekanntgabe  		**Explanation:** Each word listed changes the meaning compared to the reference and source sentences: 	- "ihres" (its) mismatches "seines" (its) in terms of the gender context.	- "Deckstars" is a literal, but less common, translation for "cover star", whereas "Coverstars" is more idiomatic in German.	- "heiß" (hotly) does not convey the same nuanced anticipation as "sehnsüchtig" (longingly), which is a closer match to the anticipation in the context.	- "Ankündigung" (announcement) shifts the formal tone compared to "Bekanntgabe" (notification/announcement).
cover → Schutz → Cover  		**Explanation:** "Schutz" (protection) is a mistranslation of "cover" in this context. The **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule is violated because "Schutz" does not convey the correct meaning of appearing on a magazine cover. "Cover" is the correct translation here.
celebrities → Jubeln → Berühmtheiten  	cover → Deck → Cover  	featured → geprägt → waren  	who → welche → die  	celebrities → Feier → Berühmtheiten  		**Explanation:**  	- "Jubeln" (cheer) is a mistranslation of "celebrities". This word does not make sense in the context of individuals who model and is thus incorrect.	- "Deck" (deck) is a mistranslation of "cover". In publishing, "cover" refers to the front of a magazine or book, not a deck of cards.	- "geprägt" (shaped) is a mistranslation of "featured". "Waren" (were) accurately captures the action of being present on the cover.	- "welche" (which) is a grammatical mistake for "who". In German, "die" would be the correct relative pronoun in this context.	- "Feier" (celebration) is a mistranslation of "celebrities". In context, the people are being referred to, not an event.
Oscar winner → Oscar Gewinner → Oscar-Preisträgerin  	Dior ambassador → Botschafter → Dior-Markenbotschafterin  	was featured → waren zu nennen → war auf dem Cover  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Oscar Gewinner" (Oscar winner) lacks the gender-specific detail present in "Oscar-Preisträgerin" (Oscar-winning actress). "Gewinner" (winner) is gender-neutral in German, whereas "Preisträgerin" specifies a female winner, maintaining contextual accuracy.	2. "Botschafter" (ambassador) lacks the specific association with the Dior brand, as indicated by "Dior-Markenbotschafterin" (Dior brand ambassador), which refers specifically to Lawrence’s role.	3. "waren zu nennen" translates to "were to be named" which misrepresents "was featured" (war auf dem Cover), indicating the appearance on a magazine cover, changing the context of how Lawrence was showcased.
Ausbruchmodell → Ausbruchmodell → Durchbruchmodell  		**Explanation:** "Ausbruchmodell" (breaking out model) is a mistranslation of "breakout model", which should be "Durchbruchmodell" (breakthrough model). The erroneous translation changes the intended meaning significantly, as "breakout" in this context refers to a model who has recently achieved significant recognition or success.
celebrities → Feierlichkeiten → Berühmtheiten	reality → Realitäts → Reality	kids → Kinder → Jugendliche  		**Explanation:** 	- "Feierlichkeiten" (celebrations) is a mistranslation of "celebrities," changing the subject of the sentence entirely, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Realitäts" (reality in possessive form) does not match the intended "reality stars" context since "Reality" in German already serves as the correct loanword for this context, following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "Kinder" (children/kids) inaccurately translates the nuanced meaning of "kids these days" which is better captured by "Jugendliche" (youth/adolescents) in this context, aligning with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
legitimately → rechtmäßig → wirklich  		**Explanation:** "rechtmäßig" (lawfully) is a mistranslation of "legitimately". The word should convey the sense of being truly or genuinely talented, not in accordance with the law, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Beyonce → Noch einmal → Beyonce  	appeared → vor der Tür stand → erschien  	release → Freilassung → Veröffentlichung  		**Explanation:** "Noch einmal" (again) is a mistranslation, as it does not pertain to Beyonce's name or presence on the cover. "vor der Tür stand" (stood in front of the door) is an incorrect translation for "appeared", greatly confusing the context. "Freilassung" (release/freeing, in the sense of liberation) is incorrect for "release" in the context of a music album, which should be "Veröffentlichung" (publication/release). These errors significantly alter the original meaning, respecting the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "freut sich" (is pleased) and "gefällt" (pleases) are acceptable translations with nearly the same meaning in this context. The candidate sentence maintains the original intent, respecting the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
reality → Realität → Reality-TV  	television → Fernsehens → TV  	fraught → frappierend → angespannt  		**Explanation:**  	- "Realität" (reality) is a mistranslation of "reality" referring to "reality TV," which is a specific genre. The correct term is "Reality-TV."	- "Fernsehens" (television) should be "TV" in this context to accurately reflect "reality TV" as a genre rather than the medium.	- "Frappierend" (startling or remarkable) does not convey the intended meaning of "fraught," which in this context means "tense" or "uneasy." The correct translation is "angespannt."
Victoria's Secret → Geheimmodell → Victoria's Secret  	model → Geheimmodell → Modell  	colleague → Kollegen → Kollegin  	Hadid → Hado → Hadid  	bitches → Teile → Miststücke  		**Explanation:**  	1. **"Victoria's Secret" → "Geheimmodell" → "Victoria's Secret"**: "Geheimmodell" is a compound translation ("secret" + "model") and does not properly represent the brand name, which should remain unchanged to convey the correct meaning.	2. **"model" → "Geheimmodell" → "Modell"**: "Geheimmodell" (secret model) isn't an accurate translation here, and "Modell" would simply retain the intended meaning.	3. **"colleague" → "Kollegen" → "Kollegin"**: "Kollegen" is the masculine or plural form, while "Kollegin" is the correct singular feminine form required by the context.	4. **"Hadid" → "Hado" → "Hadid"**: "Hado" is a mistranscription or mispronunciation of the name "Hadid", which should remain unchanged.	5. **"bitches" → "Teile" → "Miststücke"**: "Teile" (parts or pieces) is an incorrect and euphemistic translation of "bitches", which changes the intended tone and meaning significantly. The correct and contextually fitting translation in this specific wording is "Miststücke".
news → Nachrichten → Nachricht  	cover → verstärkt → Cover  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Nachrichten" (news - plural) is a mistranslation of "news" (singular). The reference uses "Nachricht" (singular), aligning with the singular "news" in the source sentence.	2. "verstärkt" (intensified) does not convey the specific meaning of a "cover" appearance in the context of a magazine cover. The reference uses "Cover", which accurately represents the "cover" concept in the source sentence.
discontent → Unzufriedenheit → Missmut	beside → neben → vorbeizugehen		**Explanation:** "Unzufriedenheit" (discontent) is a valid translation, but "Missmut" (gloom or dissatisfaction) better fits the context expressed in the reference. "Neben dem Punkt zu liegen" (beside the point) conveys a more literal meaning in German, while "am Punkt vorbeizugehen" (missing the point) captures the intended idiomatic expression. Therefore, "Unzufriedenheit" and "neben" are considered significant translation errors in this context.
cover → Zusammenhang → Cover	Issue → Affäre → Ausgabe		**Explanation:** "Zusammenhang" (context) is a mistranslation of "cover" since it signifies her appearance on a magazine cover, and "Affäre" (affair) is a mistranslation of "Issue" (Ausgabe in this context as the edition of a magazine), both of which change the intended meaning of the sentence. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and reference translation convey the same meaning, despite differences in word order. All individual words in the candidate translation ("Supermodell", "wahrsten", "Sinne", "Wortes") are correct and properly convey the intended meaning in context. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as there is no significant change in meaning or accuracy.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "geht" and "läuft" can be used to translate "walking" in this context, and neither significantly changes the intended meaning. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where both translations are considered acceptable.
Estee Lauder foundation → Estee Lauder-Stiftung → Grundierung von Estee Lauder		**Explanation:** In this case, "Estee Lauder-Stiftung" is a mistranslation of "Estee Lauder foundation." The German word "Stiftung" means "foundation" in the sense of an institution or organization, not in the cosmetic context, which significantly changes the meaning. The correct term for the cosmetic product "foundation" is "Grundierung." This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because using "Stiftung" alters the category of the product being discussed.
pictures → Papieren → Bilder  	paywalled apps → bezahlten Papieren → Paywall-Apps  		**Explanation:** "Papieren" (papers) is a mistranslation of "pictures" as it changes the type of product being sold. "bezahlten Papieren" (paid papers) is an incorrect translation of "paywalled apps", where the key mistranslation is "Papieren" (papers) instead of "Apps" (apps), altering the nature of the medium.
selling → Verkaufsbilder → verkauft  	photographed → fotografierten → von ihr gemachte  	magazine → LOVE → Zeitschrift LOVE  		**Explanation:**  	- "Verkaufsbilder" (sales pictures) mistranslates "selling", shifting the focus from the action to the objects. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the subject of the sentence.	- "fotografierten" (photographed) in this context incorrectly represents the action, as it suggests the event rather than the description of who did it. The reference implies the correct context with "von ihr gemachte" (made by her).	- "LOVE" is seen as a location here, which ignores "LOVE" being the name of a magazine. Therefore, "magazine" was not translated to "Zeitschrift", which changes the context per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
downtime → Uhrzeit → Freizeit  	reality → Realitätsfernsehen → Reality TV  		**Explanation:** "Uhrzeit" (time of day) is a mistranslation of "downtime," which should be translated as "Freizeit" (free time). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Realitätsfernsehen" (literal translation of reality television) is not the commonly used term in German; "Reality TV" is the correct reference. Hence, it violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule since it might convey a slightly different or more formal sense.
Community → Gemeinschaft → Gemeinde  	turn → machen → weisen  	people → Menschen → Leute  		**Explanation:** "Gemeinschaft" (community) translates to "Gemeinde" in this context, indicating a group of people served by legal centres. "Machen" (make) is a mistranslation of "turn away," which should be "weisen" (to turn away) to accurately reflect the action described. "Menschen" (people) could be considered synonymous with "Leute," but taken together with the other mistranslations, it contributes to a shift in expected terminology.
vulnerable → Schwächsten → Hilfsbedürfigsten  	community → gemeinschaftlichen → Gemeinderechtszentren  	sector → Sektor → Branche  	operations → Operationen → Transaktionen  		**Explanation:** "Schwächsten" (weakest) is a mistranslation of "vulnerable", which changes the description from needing help to being weak. "gemeinschaftlichen" (community-related) does not convey the specific legal aspect present in "Gemeinderechtszentren" (community legal centers). "Sektor" (sector) is acceptable, but "Branche" (industry) fits better in this context. "Operationen" (operations) does not correspond to the intended meaning of "transaktionen" (transactions). Each identified mistranslation alters the intended meaning or context importantly.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with the reference translation in terms of key terms and context. Alternative expressions such as "schutzbedürftige Arbeitnehmer" (vulnerable workers) for "hilfsbedürftige Arbeiter" are valid variations that maintain the meaning, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. As such, there are no significant mistranslation errors that warrant correction.
stretched → hinausgehen → übermäßig ausgelastet  	bracing → drängen → bereit  		**Explanation:**  	1. "hinausgehen" (go beyond) is a mistranslation of "stretched", meant to convey being overextended or overloaded. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes the intended description of the current capacity of the services.	2. "drängen" (push or urge) does not convey the sense of "preparing" or "anticipating" further cuts and hence violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule in the context of "bracing for further cuts".
federal → föderalen → Bundes  	lose → verdrängt → verlieren  		**Explanation:** "föderalen" is a mistranslation of "federal" in this context, as the more correct term in German is "Bundes" when referring to funding from the federal government. "verdrängt" (displaced) is incorrect for "lose" because it alters the intended meaning; "verlieren" (lose) is needed to convey the correct loss of funding.
Queensland → Quenelland → Queesland		**Explanation:** "Quenelland" is a mistranslation of "Queensland". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it refers to the correct geographical location. The error is significant because it inaccurately specifies a place name.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the meaning of the source sentence within the context and aligns closely with the reference translation. The variation in expressing "reversal of the federal government decision" does not significantly alter the intended meaning.
Queensland's → Die → Queenslands	community → Gemeinschaften → Gemeinderechtszentren  	services → Dienstleistungen → Diensten  		**Explanation:**	- "Queensland's" is specifically mistranslated as "Die," which incorrectly omits the proper noun, changing the subject referenced.	- "community" translated as "Gemeinschaften" is incorrect because it should convey "community legal centres," emphasizing a specific legal context provided by communities, not just any community's centres.	- "services" translated as "Dienstleistungen" instead of "Diensten" misses the precise usage in context, where "Diensten" may better convey more generic, potentially broader "services," matching the reference.
**(source word → candidate word → correct reference word)**		people → Menschen → Leute  		**Explanation:** "Menschen" and "Leute" are both translations of "people," but in the context of this specific reference translation, "Leute" was used consistently and was intended. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule with a focus on achieving the closest reference match when possible.		help → benötigte → Hilfe  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation omits "Hilfe" (help), leading to an incomplete meaning. The correct word in context should match closely with "Hilfe" from the reference to convey the full meaning of the sentence. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the candidate sentence misses an essential part of communication.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the meaning of the source sentence. Although there are differences in the translation of "vulnerable Queenslanders" and "navigate complex legal problems," the overall meaning is consistent with both the source and the reference. The translation choices made in the candidate sentence do not result in any significant change of meaning, thus adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "Generalstaatsanwalt" and "Generalbundesanwalt" are acceptable translations for "Attorney-General," maintaining the intended meaning. Additionally, while the representation of George Brandis' titles varies slightly, these differences do not introduce a significant change in meaning. Therefore, in accordance with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no significant translation errors are detected in the candidate sentence.
government → Regierung des Staates → Landesregierung  	legal aid → Rechtsbeihilfen → Rechtshilfen  		**Explanation:** "Regierung des Staates" is a more literal translation of "state government," whereas "Landesregierung" is the more commonly accepted term that conveys the same meaning in the context of a German audience. The translation of "legal aid" as "Rechtsbeihilfen" is technically correct but can be more accurately translated as "Rechtshilfen," as it is the preferred term in the legal and linguistic context provided.
Palaszczuk → Palaszzkok → Palaszczuk		**Explanation:** "Palaszzkok" is a mistranslation of "Palaszczuk," which is a proper noun and should have been translated accurately. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as changing the name impacts the specificity and correctness of the translation.
staffer → gezaubert → Mitarbeiter  	pulled → gezaubert → zog  	gun → gezaubert → Waffe  		**Explanation:**  	- "gezaubert" (magically conjured) is a mistranslation of "staffer" (Mitarbeiter), significantly altering the meaning. This error also affects the action "pulled" and the object "gun." The entire phrase is incorrect, but according to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, each mistranslated component must be individually specified.
director → Direktor → Kampagnenleiter  	gun → Pistole → Schusswaffe  
filed → eingereicht → eingereicht	lawsuit → Rechtssache → Anklageschrift	state → Staatsgericht → Landesgericht	Bordini → Bordi → Bordini	trainer → Ausbilder → Programmierer		**Explanation:**		- "filed" → "eingereicht" is correct, thus no translation error is identified here despite being listed.	- "lawsuit" was mistranslated as "Rechtssache" (legal matter), while "Anklageschrift" (indictment) is a better fit, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule since it specifies the nature of the legal document.	- "state court" was mistranslated as "Staatsgericht" (state court), while "Landesgericht" (district court) more accurately matches the German legal terminology associated with state-level courts, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Bordini" was mistranslated as "Bordi", a typographical error, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "trainer" was translated as "Ausbilder" (instructor), while "Programmierer" (programmer) precisely matches with reference; however, if "trainer" matches situational duties, this might not be entirely incorrect. Hence, it's included because it's a noticeable deviation but may not necessarily break meaning given no context specifies "trainer" versus "programmer."
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence. There are no single-word substitutions that significantly alter the meaning when compared to the reference translation. Any differences, such as "Bordii sagte" vs. "Bordini gab an," are acceptable variations that do not impact the overall meaning in context.
director → Direktor → Kampagnenleiter  	produced → herausgegeben → zog  	right → richtigen → rechten  	barrel → Barrel → Lauf  	knee → Knie → Kniekehle  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Direktor" is a mistranslation of "director" when the reference provides more specific context as "Kampagnenleiter" (campaign manager).	2. "herausgegeben" (issued) is incorrect for "produced" in this physical context, which should be "zog" (drew).	3. "richtigen" translates to "correct", while "right" in this context should be "rechten" (right, as in the right side of the body).	4. "Barrel" is a direct borrowing from English, while "barrel" in this firearm context should be "Lauf".	5. "Knie" (knee) is not specific enough in this context where "Kniekehle" (knee cap) is the intended meaning.
experience → hatten → Erfahrung  		**Explanation:** The source word "experience" which is represented in the reference translation as "Erfahrung" is mistranslated as "hatten" in the candidate translation. Simply using "hatten" (had) omits the specific notion of having an experience, which alters the intended meaning, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Bordini → Bordi → Bordini  		**Explanation:** "Bordi" is a mistranslation of "Bordini," which significantly alters the individual mentioned in the sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it inaccurately represents the person's name.
suit → Anzug → Anklage  	nominee → Kandidat → Präsidentschaftskandidat  	furore → Ärger → Aufruhr  	telling → erzählte → sagte  	crowd → Menge → Menschenmenge  	people → Änderungsantrag → Leute  	take → aneignen → ernennen  	his → sein → seine  		**Explanation:**  	- "Anzug" (suit) is a mistranslation of "suit" meant to refer to a lawsuit ("Anklage"), changing the context significantly.	- "Kandidat" (candidate) fails to specify "Präsidentschaftskandidat" (presidential nominee), which is a critical distinction.	- "Ärger" (annoyance) is a weaker term than "Aufruhr" (furore), altering the intensity of the original event.	- "erzählte" (narrated) is less appropriate than "sagte" (said) in this context.	- "Menge" (amount/crowd) should be "Menschenmenge" (crowd of people), providing clearer imagery.	- "Änderungsantrag" (amendment) is incorrectly used for "Leute" (people), changing the meaning entirely.	- "aneignen" (appropriate) should be "ernennen" (appoint), accurately reflecting the intended action regarding judges.	- "sein" (his) needs to be "seine" (his/her) for grammatical gender agreement with "Rivalin" (female rival).
words → ihre → seine  	advocating → sich → zur  		**Explanation:**  		1. "ihre" (their) is a mistranslation of "his", referring to Trump's words. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it incorrectly attributes the words to multiple individuals instead of Trump himself.		2. "sich" (themselves) is used incorrectly as part of the phrase and does not match with "advocating" in this context. The correct translation refers to inciting or advocating violence, so "zur" is used in the reference to accurately convey the intended meaning of "advocating violence". This is a significant error under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
negligent → fahrlässige → Verletzung der Sorgfaltspflicht  	assault → Angriffe → Körperverletzung  	battery → Batterien → Körperverletzung  	infliction → emotionale → bleibender seelischer  	emotional distress → Verzweiflung → Schäden  		**Explanation:** 	1. "fahrlässige" (negligent) is a partial match but doesn't convey the complete legal term "Verletzung der Sorgfaltspflicht" (breach of duty of care). 	2. "Angriffe" (attacks) is a mistranslation for "assault", which, in the legal context, should be translated as "Körperverletzung".	3. "Batterien" (batteries) is incorrect; in this context, it should also be part of "Körperverletzung" meaning "battery" in legal terms.	4. "emotionale" (emotional) as part of the phrase "emotionale Verzweiflung" (emotional despair) doesn't accurately capture "infliction of emotional distress," which is better rendered by "bleibender seelischer Schäden" (lasting psychological damage).	5. "Verzweiflung" (despair) is not quite equivalent to "distress" and should be translated as "Schäden" (damage) to fit the legal context.
Hope → treppe → Trumps  	spokeswoman → Sprecherin → Pressesprecherin  	message → Botschaft → Stellungnahme  		**Explanation:**  	- "treppe" (staircase) is a mistranslation of "Hope," where the personal name should remain unchanged, and "Trumps" is the possessive form indicating the spokeswoman belongs to Trump.	- "Sprecherin" is translated as "spokeswoman," but the more accurate and contextually appropriate translation in this context is "Pressesprecherin" since it refers specifically to someone authorized to speak on behalf of someone else in a formal capacity.	- "Botschaft" (message) is a mistranslation of the contextual "Stellungnahme" (comment/statement), significantly altering the meaning of the intended communication action.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Versuche, Phillip zu erreichen, waren erfolglos." accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The difference in wording from "kontaktieren schlugen ebenso fehl" in the reference translation is an acceptable variation that does not change the overall meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
WCCB → Die CCB → WCCB  	affiliate → Nachrichtengesellschaft → Nachrichtensender  	left → verließ → nicht länger Mitarbeiter  		**Explanation:**  	- "Die CCB" is a mistranslation of "WCCB". This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since the station's call letters are specific identifiers and should not be changed.	- "Nachrichtengesellschaft" (news company) is a mistranslation of "news affiliate". While "Nachrichtensender" (broadcast station) more closely aligns with the meaning of "affiliate," changing the type of media from specific to a general type of company could lead to confusion.	- "verließ" (left) alters the specific phrasing present in the reference translation, which states Phillip is "nicht länger Mitarbeiter" (no longer an employee). This distinction focuses on employment status rather than a more general departure, aligning with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
call → Aufruf → Anrufe  	returned → zurückgeschickt → reagiert  		**Explanation:** "Aufruf" (call) and "Anrufe" (calls) are similar in meaning, but in this context, the correct translation should be in plural form as in the reference. "zurückgeschickt" (sent back) is a mistranslation of "returned" in the sense intended as "responded to", which is better captured by "reagiert" (responded). This fits under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the intent from not sending something back to not responding.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The addition of "bisher" (so far) in the reference translation does not change the core meaning and therefore does not constitute a significant translation error. The sole discrepancy "Trumpp" could be a typographical error, but within the context of translation, it does not alter meaning given the clarity in identifying Donald Trump as the referenced individual. Therefore, no significant single-word error substantially altering the meaning of the source sentence is present, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Bordini → Bordi → Bordini  	Trump → Trumpf → Trump  	General Court → Generalgerichtshof → Oberstes Gericht  		**Explanation:**  	- "Bordi" is a mistranslation of "Bordini". The change affects the proper noun, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the name should remain unchanged.	- "Trumpf" is a mistranslation of "Trump". Altering the name changes the identity, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Generalgerichtshof" does not match "General Court" accurately and is used incorrectly in the context of judicial jurisdictions; "General Court" is correctly translated as "Oberstes Gericht" in this legal context.
Poll → Abstimmung → Umfrage  	ahead → vor → vor  	lose out → (missing) → verlieren  		**Explanation:** "Abstimmung" (vote) is a mistranslation of "Poll," which refers to a survey rather than a voting event, violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule. The phrase "lose out" is missing in the candidate translation compared to the reference, which translates to "verlieren" (lose). "ahead" is correctly translated as "vor," aligning with both source and reference.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation, while using different expressions, maintains the same meaning as the reference translation. For example, "Vor den Wahlen" (before the elections) and "Bei den anstehenden Wahlen" (at the upcoming elections) convey similar timing aspects. "Bundesstaaten" (federal states) is interchangeable with "Bundesländern" (federal states) in this context. "Regierenden Parteien" (governing parties) and "Regierungsparteien" (government parties) both refer to the same entities. "Beträchtliche Verluste" (considerable losses) and "erhebliche Verluste" (significant losses) are synonymous when discussing the losses. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule as all alternative expressions provide a valid translation maintaining the sentence's original meaning.
representative → Volksbefragung → repräsentative  	findings → Ergebnisse → ergaben  		**Explanation:** "Volksbefragung" (plebiscite or popular survey) is a mistranslation of "representative" and thus changes the type of poll being described, which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Additionally, "Ergebnisse" (results) translates more closely than "findings" but doesn't maintain the context of "ergaben", which relates to how results are reported or determined.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Each significant word choice in the candidate translation aligns well with the source and reference translations. The variations present, such as "vielleicht einfach" vs. "knapp", or "laut Umfrage" vs. "nach den Umfragewerten", are acceptable and do not represent significant changes in meaning, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While there are some differences in phrasing and structure between the candidate and reference translations, such as "vorzubringen" (put forward) instead of "stellen" (present), these do not constitute significant translation errors in terms of meaning or context. Thus, no meaningful single-word translation errors are present.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence uses "gesunken" (dropped/sunken) instead of "stürzte ab" (plummeted), but this does not significantly change the meaning and can be considered an acceptable variation according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** instruction. Both sentences convey the idea of a decrease from 35.6% to 24% in five years, matching the source information accurately. Thus, no significant mistranslation errors are present at the word level.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** While the candidate translation uses the phrase "übersteigt die Partei damit nur geringfügig die CDU", it accurately conveys the meaning of "puts the party only slightly above the CDU". The usage of "mit 23%" correctly translates "who had 23 percent". The meaning is preserved overall, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. "Die Linke" is an acceptable translation of "The Left," and "werden um den dritten Platz kämpfen" is a suitable translation for "will fight over third place." The key elements and context are preserved, so there are no significant errors or mistranslations to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The phrase structures and word choices, though slightly different from the reference, do not alter the intended meaning of the original English sentence. The main semantic content is maintained, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by correctly presenting the statistical details and the potential political outcome.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** While minor phrasing differences are present between the candidate and reference translations, the candidate sentence preserves the original meaning and context of the source sentence accurately. Therefore, no meaningful single-word translation errors were identified.
NPD → das RPD → FDP  	regional → Regionalparlament → Landtag  		**Explanation:**  	1. "das RPD" is a mistranslation of "FPD". Although the source has "FPD", the intended reference seems to be "FDP", which is a known political party ("Freie Demokratische Partei" - Free Democratic Party) in Germany. The mistranslation changes the meaning of the original sentence.	2. "Regionalparlament" is a mistranslation of "regional parliament". While "Regionalparlament" directly translates to "regional parliament", the reference uses "Landtag", which is a more contextually appropriate term for regional parliaments within German states. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
percent → % → Prozent		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses the symbol "%" instead of the word "Prozent," which does not conform to the typical language convention used in the reference and slightly changes the formality of the representation. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because numbers should be consistently represented in translations.
23.4% → kosten → erreichte  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "kosten" (cost) is a mistranslation of the verb "take" or "reach" in this context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the CDU's percentage refers to election results, not cost. Thus, "kosten" is not appropriate in this context and should be "erreichte" to maintain the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While there are some minor differences in sentence construction, the candidate and reference translations reflect the same essential meaning of the source sentence. The percentages, party names, and comparative positions are accurately translated, adhering to the overall context and meaning. There are no individual word mistranslations that significantly change the meaning. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, indicating that there are no translation errors to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although there is a slight variation in structure and word choice, such as "im Parlament" instead of "im Abgeordnetenhaus", this does not constitute a significant change in meaning. "Parlament" (Parliament) is a valid representation of "House" in this context, and thus, under the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, there are no meaningful errors.
FPD → FPD → FDP  	auskommen → auskommen → verpassen  		**Explanation:** 		1. "FPD" in the candidate translation is a mistranslation of "FDP" from the source. The reference confirms the correct term should be "FDP," as "FDP" is the appropriate abbreviation for the political party.		2. "auskommen" (to manage/get by) is a mistranslation of "miss out" from the source. The correct reference word is "verpassen" (to miss), which fits better in the context of missing an opportunity or chance, such as failing to achieve an election threshold.
Communicator → Kommunikation → Communicator  		smartphones → Smartphones → Smartphone  		**Explanation:** "Kommunikation" (communication) is a mistranslation of "Communicator". This does not fit the intended meaning in context, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Additionally, "Smartphones" (plural) is used instead of the singular "Smartphone," which is significant in accurately portraying it as the first of its kind, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
1. Communicator → Kommunikation → Communicator		**Explanation:** "Kommunikation" (communication) is a mistranslation of "Communicator," which is a specific product name ("Nokia Communicator"). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes the reference from a specific device to a general concept.		2. was brought → sind nur langsam in Bewegung gebracht worden → kam		**Explanation:** "sind nur langsam in Bewegung gebracht worden" translates as "were only slowly brought into movement," which does not convey the original notion of "was brought to market" (kam auf den Markt). This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule by altering the original message from the specific action of introducing a product to the market to an ambiguous state of being in motion.
1. successors → Nachfolger → Nachfolger  	**Explanation:** Although "Ihre" (their) is used, which could imply feminine or plural in German, "Nachfolger" itself is the correct translation of "successors". However, there is no clear mistranslation based solely on the "Nachfolger" term in this context.		2. her (possessive pronoun) → ihre → sein  	**Explanation:** The source uses "its" (singular, neutral possessive), but the candidate uses "ihre" (their). The reference correctly uses "sein" which aligns with the singular, neutral possessive. The use of "ihre" significantly changes the intended subject of the possessive pronoun.		**(its → ihre → sein)**		3. disaster → Katastrophe → Desaster  	**Explanation:** While both "Katastrophe" and "Desaster" can be synonyms, the source and reference agreement on "Desaster" suggests it is more contextually appropriate, considering tone and nuance. However, given their near-synonymous nature and this being a nuanced distinction rather than a clear mistranslation, it can be overlooked.		The only significant mistranslation that needs listing according to the instructions is the possessive pronoun error as it's impactful on clarity and context. Thus the final output reflects this:		**(its → ihre → sein)**
weighed → gewogen → wog  	heavy → hoch → schwer  		**Explanation:** "gewogen" (has weighed) is a mistranslation of "weighed," as "wog" is the correct past tense form for this context, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "hoch" (high) is a mistranslation of "heavy," changing the measurement type, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
thicker → immer → dicker  	harder → schwieriger → lag deshalb auch nicht gut  		**Explanation:** "immer" (still) is a mistranslation of "thicker", changing the intended description. "schwieriger" (harder) is a mistranslation for the phrase "harder to hold", as the reference uses "lag deshalb auch nicht gut" to express difficulty in holding, which conveys the correct meaning in context.
indeed → in der Tat → im Gegenteil  	bulky → schwammig → klobig  		**Explanation:** "in der Tat" (indeed) is a mistranslation of "im Gegenteil" (on the contrary), which completely changes the tone of the sentence. "schwammig" (spongy) is a mistranslation of "bulky", which changes the physical description. Both errors are critical to maintaining the intended meaning and context, and therefore they violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
1. in-built → im Bau befindliche → eingebaute	2. storage → Lagerhaltung → Speicher	3. megabytes → Megabyten → Megabyte	4. high-resolution → Hochwasserstoffe → hohe Auflösung		**Explanation:** 	- "im Bau befindliche" (under construction) is a mistranslation of "in-built". "Eingebaute" (built-in) is the correct term referring to something integrated or embedded.	- "Lagerhaltung" (inventory management) is a mistranslation of "storage". "Speicher" (memory/storage) accurately refers to the context of data capacity.	- "Megabyten" is a mistranslation of "megabytes". In German, the correct plural form is "Megabyte".	- "Hochwasserstoffe" (flood substances) is a mistranslation of "high-resolution". It doesn't make context sense about selfies quality. "Hohe Auflösung" (high resolution) is the accurate term to describe the quality of images.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the essential meaning of the source sentence. The word "hält" (holds) can be understood in context, and no significant change in meaning occurs that requires reporting an error. Additionally, "iphone" matches in meaning even if not capitalized, but capitalization alone is not a significant error. Thus, according to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, no mistranslations are present.
Nokia 9000 Communicator → Nokia 9000 Kommunikatorin → Nokia 9000 Communicator  	smartphone → Smartpon → Smartphone  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Kommunikatorin" is a mistranslation of "Communicator". The source uses the proper product name "Nokia 9000 Communicator," and altering it to "Kommunikatorin" is an incorrect translation that changes a part of the brand and product identity, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Smartpon" is a clear mistranslation of "smartphone." This term does not convey the intended meaning in any context and alters the technological reference, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although there are differences in the structure and some word choices between the candidate and the reference translations, none of these differences constitute single-word translation errors that significantly alter the meaning of the sentence. The key elements - device availability, online accessibility, price in euros, and "stone age" origin - are preserved. Following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, these variations are acceptable.
20 years ago → Senat → Sensation  		**Explanation:** "Senat" (Senate) is a mistranslation of "sensation." This significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it alters the intended impact of the Communicator.
computer trade fair → Computer-fair → Computermesse  	billing → abgerechnet → angekündigt  
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation properly conveys the meaning of the source sentence, maintaining the essence of the reference translation. The single-word choices in the candidate sentence do not significantly alter the meaning compared to the source and reference sentences, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
HTML browser → HTML-Bruder → HTML-Browser		**Explanation:** "HTML-Bruder" (HTML brother) is a mistranslation of "HTML browser". This illustrates a significant contextual inaccuracy, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "brother" is not a tool or application used to access websites.
calculator → Kalender → Taschenrechner  		**Explanation:** "Kalender" (calendar) is incorrectly used in place of "calculator". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because a calendar serves a different purpose than a calculator, impacting the overall meaning of the sentence.
antenna → Antenna → Antenne  	folded → weiterverfolgt → aufgeklappt  		**Explanation:** "Antenna" is not fully translated to the correct German term "Antenne", violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule. "Weiterverfolgt" (pursued/followed up) is a mistranslation of "folded", significantly altering the function of the device, which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
keyboard → Leitfaden → Tastatur  		**Explanation:** "Leitfaden" (guide) is a mistranslation of "keyboard", which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because a guide is not an object that would be revealed in the same context as a screen. "small" is not listed as an error, as it correctly translates to "kleinen" (although missing in reference) and fits contextually. "black and white screen" has been translated accurately as "schwarzen und weißen Bildschirm".
(Deutschmarks → Deutsche → D-Mark)		**Explanation:** "Deutsche" is not a valid singular translation of "Deutschmarks," which refers to the currency. The correct singular form used in the reference is "D-Mark," meaning "Deutsche Mark." This error is significant as it affects the meaning in the context of currency, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same essential information as the reference translation. There are no significant single-word mistranslations that affect the meaning of the sentence. Hence, it adheres to the task's error analysis guidelines.
1996 → 1996 → 1996  	Communicator → Mitteilung → Communicator  	smartphone → Smarttplans → Smartphone  	era → ankündigte → Ära   		**Explanation:**  	- "Mitteilung" (communication) is a mistranslation of "Communicator" which is likely a proper noun in this context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it changes the meaning.  	- "Smarttplans" does not correspond to "smartphone"; it seems like a syntactic mistake, altering the intended meaning in the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.  	- "ankündigte" (announced) is used in place of "era" (Era/Ära) and does not fit the expected noun. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Heute hat sich alles geändert." adequately conveys the source sentence "Today, everything has changed." The reference translation "Seitdem ist alles anders." offers an alternative way to express the same idea but does not reveal any errors in the candidate translation based on the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Smartphones sind eine Erfolgsgeschichte - auch wenn das für Nokia nicht der Fall ist." maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence. The phrases "Smartphones" and "klugen Telefone" both refer to "smartphones" and are acceptable variations. The overall message about Nokia not being a success story is intact, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule because both translations convey the intended meaning.
mobile phone branch → Mobilfunknetz → Handy-Sparte  	disaster → Katastrophe → Desaster  	wound up → abgeschlossen → abgewickelt  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Mobilfunknetz" (mobile network) is a mistranslation of "mobile phone branch". The correct translation is "Handy-Sparte", which specifically refers to the branch or division related to mobile phones, not the network.	2. "Katastrophe" (catastrophe) is a mistranslation of "disaster". It’s not a significant semantic deviation, but since the reference uses "Desaster", it implies a closer or more commonly used term.	3. "abgeschlossen" (completed/concluded) is a mistranslation of "wound up". The correct translation is "abgewickelt", which conveys the concept of winding up or finalizing operations in a business context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence. "dominiert" is a valid translation of "dominated," "Anbietern" aligns with "providers," and the rest of the sentence conveys the same message regarding the timeline and comparison to Nokia. There are no significant single-word errors that change the sentence's meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the meaning of the source sentence well. The structure is different, but the key elements like being "online all day" are preserved accurately in the context presented. While the phrasing varies from the reference sentence, the overall message remains consistent, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. The word choice such as "rund" for "around" and "Smartphonennutzer" for "smartphone users" fits well within the context and maintains the intended meaning, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the same meaning as the source sentence despite differences in phrasing. The word choices like "Rund", "Milliarden", "Geräte", "verkauft", "Samsung", "Apple", and numerical representation of "1,4 Milliarden" and "555 Millionen" are correct and in context, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Consequently, there are no meaningful single-word errors to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Verkauf" (sale) and "Umsatz" (revenue/turnover) are appropriate translations in this context. Although the candidate sentence uses "Verkauf" and the reference uses "Umsatz", the meaning of the sentence is not significantly altered. Thus, in line with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, there are no errors detected. No other words in the candidate sentence represent a change that significantly affects the sentence's meaning compared to the source and reference sentences.
providers → Pappen- → App-Anbieter  		**Explanation:** "Pappen-" is a mistranslation of "providers", which should be "App-Anbieter" in the given context. This error significantly alters the meaning of the sentence by misidentifying the focus of the providers.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Eine ganze Industrie ist jetzt um Smartphones herum entstanden." accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and aligns well with the reference translation. The differences in word order do not alter the meaning, and no significant single-word translation errors are present. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, resulting in no detected errors.
mass market → Massenmarkt → Durchbruch  	broken into → kaputt wurde → kam  	iPhone → iphone → iPhones  	Mac World → Mac World → Mac-World  		**Explanation:**  	1. "kaputt wurde" (broke/became broken) is a mistranslation of "broken into" in the context of breaking into a market, where "Durchbruch" (breakthrough) is more appropriate. This changes the intended meaning significantly, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "iphone" (lowercase) is a mistranslation of "iPhone," as the proper noun should be capitalized. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule because the official product name must be respected.	3. "Mac World" without hyphen and specific article usage gives a less accurate location name. It should be "Mac-World" as in the reference sentence. Though subtle, the correct format and article use matter, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
three → drei → in einem		**Explanation:** The mistranslation "drei" (three) omits the critical "in one" concept from the source sentence, which is essential to convey that the three functionalities are combined into a single device. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the idea is significantly altered without the "in one" concept.
Apple's → iphone → iPhone  	company → Unternehmens → Konzerns  		**Explanation:**  	1. "iphone" is a mistranslation of "iPhone". The candidate uses a lowercase version which is not proper as "iPhone" is a specific trademark that should be capitalized, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.  	2. "Unternehmens" is a reasonable translation for "company", but the preferred term in the reference, "Konzerns", carries a specific contextual nuance often associated with larger or corporate entities. Nevertheless, the change does not significantly alter the sentence's meaning in this instance, and maintaining "Unternehmens" is still contextually acceptable. Hence, only the capitalization error is significant.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In this case, the phrase "verloren den Kürzeren" (lost out) is a valid expression in German for losing in a metaphorical context, similar to "hatten das Nachsehen" (had the worst of it). Both translations effectively convey the intended meaning of losing market dominance, and thus no single-word significant errors are present according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the intended meaning of the source sentence. The verbs "verschwunden" (disappeared) and "kämpfen" (fight) are appropriately used in context. The sentence structure and word choices do align well with the source and reference, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules. There are no significant deviations that warrant identification as errors under the given task instructions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "beherrschen nun" is an acceptable translation for "hold sway". Both the candidate and reference sentences convey the intended meaning, and there are no clear single-word errors that change the meaning as per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While the candidate translation uses "Tatsache des Lebens" for "fact of life" and the reference uses "Selbstverständlichkeit", both phrases correctly convey the meaning that smartphones have become an integral or obvious part of life. Both translations maintain the essential meaning of the source sentence, and no significant error is identifiable based on the given instructions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although there are variations between the candidate and reference translations, the meaning remains intact and no significant single-word errors are present. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as both translations communicate the same overall message accurately.
phones → Telefone → Smartphone		**Explanation:** "Telefone" (phones) is a mistranslation of "Smartphone", which in the context provided refers specifically to modern cellular devices rather than traditional telephones. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by not capturing the precise type of device intended in modern usage.
contactable → Kontakt aufzunehmen → Erreichbarkeit  		**Explanation:** "Kontakt aufzunehmen" (to make contact) is a mistranslation of "contactable" (able to be contacted). The candidate translation changes the meaning by implying proactive communication, rather than the state of being reachable, which aligns with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
England → Großbritannien → England  	channel → kanalisieren → lenken  	expand → ausbauen → erweitern  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Großbritannien" (Great Britain) is a mistranslation of "Britain," which refers to "England" in this context. While commonly interchanged, the reference specifically uses "England."	2. "kanalisieren" (to channel) does not accurately capture the intended sense of "lenken" (to steer/guide) as used in the Olympic spirit context.	3. "ausbauen" (to build out) is less precise than "erweitern" (to expand) when referring to enlarging an airport.
regeneration → Erholung → Erneuerung		**Explanation:** "Erholung" (recovery/leisure) is a mistranslation of "regeneration," which significantly changes the intended meaning of the sentence to something unrelated to urban or economic development. The correct translation, "Erneuerung," matches the concept of renewal or revitalization, as intended in both the source and reference sentences. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it maintains accuracy in describing the impacts of Heathrow.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While there are differences between the candidate and reference translations, none of the words in the candidate significantly alter the meaning of the original sentence. The terms used, such as "Attraktivität" instead of "Attraktion," do not lead to misunderstandings and are acceptable variations in this context. Therefore, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, there are no reportable single-word translation errors.
Stratford → Strafford → Stratford  	East End → Ostende → East End  		**Explanation:** "Strafford" is a mistranslation of "Stratford", which changes the location being referred to. "Ostende" (East End) does not correctly reflect the name of the area, which in this context is a specific region in London and should remain "East End" as seen in the reference. Both of these follow the **Identify Mistranslations** rule with significant contextual implications.
local → lokalen → Ortsansässige		**Explanation:** "lokalen" (local) could suggest geographical locality, which might be correct. However, "Ortsansässige" (residents) specifically targets people living in the area, aligning better with the original intention. Since "local" here refers specifically to "local people," "Ortsansässige" captures a more precise meaning.
(around → um → in)  	(bring → schaffen → bereiten)  	(end → schaffen → ein Ende)  		**Explanation:** "um" (around) is contextually incorrect as it should be translated to "in" when referring to "in der Flughafenumgebung," meaning "in the airport environment." "schaffen" is repeated in the context of creating a positive outcome, incorrectly translating "bring an end to," which should be more accurately rendered as "bereiten" or similar to express ending something. The double use of "schaffen" suggests creation rather than ceasing ("end"), hence "schaffen" mistranslates "bring" and "end" in this context.
**(ahead → vor → voraus)**		**Explanation:** The candidate uses "vor" (before) for "ahead," while the intended meaning in the context is more about being "ahead" or "leading," which is better captured by "voraus" (ahead). This aligns with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it significantly affects the meaning of the sentence.
Britain → Großbritannien → England  	embarrassed → peinlich → blamieren  		**Explanation:** "Großbritannien" (Great Britain) is a mistranslation of "Britain" where the reference uses "England," which may depend on context but is noted here as a discrepancy. "peinlich" (embarrassing or awkward) incorrectly translates what is intended to be "embarrassed," leading to a subtle change in meaning, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
(Heathrow → in → bei)  		**Explanation:** "in" (in) is a mistranslation of "on" in this context. "bei" (at) accurately conveys the sense of being wrong about the specific topic or event, which is Heathrow in the English sentence. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule because "in Heathrow" implies a physical presence rather than being conceptually wrong about Heathrow.
question → Anfrage → Frage		**Explanation:** "Anfrage" (request) is a mistranslation of "question". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the candidate word changes the context from responding to questions to responding to requests, which alters the intended meaning of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The words "für viele, nicht nur für wenige" in the candidate directly correspond to the meaning of "an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few," as intended in the source sentence. The reference translation uses slightly different phrasing, but the candidate's choice is a perfectly valid interpretation that maintains the intended meaning throughout the sentence. Therefore, no significant single-word translation errors are identified.
economic → Wirtschaftswachstum → wirtschaftlichem Wachstum		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Wirtschaftswachstum" (economic growth) instead of "wirtschaftlichem Wachstum" (in terms of economic growth). The reference translation specifies the intended context, which is "an economic growth," hence emphasizing the grammatical form ('wirtschaftlichem') that aligns with the reference. Other words like "um den Flughafen" (around the airport) and "sowohl im Vereinigten Königreich" (across the UK) do not need to be flagged as they the omissions of "in terms of" ('an') or rephrased segments, which, while slightly different grammatically, do not change the meaning significantly.
great → großartig → tolles  	on time → pünktlich → in Zeit  	on budget → haushaltsmäßig → Budget  	years → Jahre → Jahre  	runways → Startbahnen → Laufstege  	busiest → am stärksten betroffenen → frequentiertesten  		**Explanation:**  	- "großartig" vs. "tolles": While "großartig" can be considered a translation for "great", there is a nuance difference as "tolles" fits better with "team" as a more common collocation.	- "pünktlich" vs. "in Zeit": "pünktlich" typically translates to "punctual/on time" for specific events, whereas "in Zeit" reflects completing an entire programme within the set deadline.	- "haushaltsmäßig" vs. "Budget": "haushaltsmäßig" implies something relating to household budgeting, whereas using "Budget" more accurately reflects financial context for large-scale investments.	- "Jahre" appears accurate for "years", so appears correctly here. 	- "Startbahnen" vs. "Laufstege": "Startbahnen" means "runways", whereas "Laufstege" (taxiways) is a more correct aviation term in this context, referring to areas an aircraft maneuvers.	- "am stärksten betroffenen" vs. "frequentiertesten": While "am stärksten betroffenen" implies "most affected" which distorts the intended meaning of "busiest" in terms of traffic or usage, "frequentiertesten" directly translates to "most frequented".
runway → Startlinie → Laufsteg  		**Explanation:** "Startlinie" (starting line) is a mistranslation of "runway". In this context, "runway" refers to a part of an airport, and the correct translation would be "Laufsteg". This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule since it significantly changes the meaning.
2012 → expandieren → die Erweiterung  		**Explanation:** "Expandieren" (expand) is a mistranslation of the intended concept "expansion." The sentence refers to the "expansion" of Heathrow, not "expanding" as a verb. Therefore, "expandieren" does not fit the intended meaning in context, and it is a violation of the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely mirrors the source sentence, maintaining the intended meaning. Any differences between "kanalisieren" and "lenken" for "channel" or "Erbe" versus "Vermächtnis" for "legacy" do not significantly alter the sentence's meaning and can be considered acceptable variations. Therefore, no single-word errors that significantly alter the meaning have been identified.
Paul Deighton → Paul Dachton → Paul Deighton  	Commercial Secretary → Handelsminister → Commercial Secretary  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Paul Dachton" is a mistranslation of "Paul Deighton," possibly due to a similar phonetic structure in German; it changes the individual's name and identity.	2. "Handelsminister" (Trade Minister) is a mistranslation of "Commercial Secretary," which specifically refers to an official title within the Treasury, altering the intended role.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Katz-und-Maus-Spiel" is analogous to "Katz-und Mausspiel", and "Blockade" can be contextually understood as "blockieren" in relation to advertisements, even though the expression differs slightly. Therefore, there are no significant single-word mistranslations that alter the core meaning in this context, in accordance with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
attempts → Versuche → Versuche  	ad-blocking → Ad-Sperr → Anzeigenblockierung  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the reference translation, with "Versuche" being valid for "attempts" in this context. However, "Ad-Sperr" (ad-lock) is a less accurate translation of "ad-blocking" compared to "Anzeigenblockierung" (ad-blocking), which faithfully conveys the intended meaning. Since "Ad-Sperr" changes the specific terminology used for ad-blocking, it is listed as a translation error.
Facebook → Ankündigung → Facebook	ad blockers → Blockaden → Anzeigeblockierungen	desktop → Hauptseite → Desktopseite	blog post → Blogstelle → Blogpost	users → Nutzer → Anwender	ads → Bänder → Werbung	social network → sozialen Netz → sozialen Netzwerk		**Explanation:** 	- "Ankündigung" (announcement) replaces the proper noun "Facebook" where it should be consistent. The structure of the sentence requires "Facebook" as the subject.	- "Blockaden" (blockades) is used instead of "Anzeigeblockierungen" (ad blockers), which inaccurately represents the type of blocking being discussed.	- "Hauptseite" (main page) does not capture the specific meaning of "desktop site," making it contextually inaccurate.	- "Blogstelle" is not a standard translation for "blog post" and deviates from the expected expression "Blogpost."	- "Nutzer" (users) and "Anwender" (users) are synonyms in some contexts, but given the context, "Anwender" is the term used in the reference.	- "Bänder" (bands) is an incorrect translation of "ads" (advertisements), changing the intended meaning significantly.	- "sozialen Netz" (social net) is incomplete for "social network," the reference translation uses "sozialen Netzwerk" to fully capture the context, fitting the terminology in technical and social media contexts.
said → sagte → teilte mit  	desktop → Waden → Desktopseite  	coding → Leitfaden → Codierung  	ads → Waden → Werbeanzeigen  	ad blockers → Blockiers → Anzeigeblockierungen  	ads → Maden → Werbung  		**Explanation:**  	- "Sagte" (said) is a direct translation and typically contextually accurate, but in this specific instance, "teilte mit" is more precise to mean "stated" or "informed," making it more fitting for an official announcement, thus addressing the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.  	- "Waden" (calves) is incorrect for both "desktop" and "ads," which should be "Desktopseite" and "Werbeanzeigen," respectively, violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "Leitfaden" (guideline) mistranslates "coding," which is better translated as "Codierung," changing the technical context mentioned in **Focus on Single-Word Errors**.  	- "Blockiers" is an incomplete or incorrect form for "ad blockers," which should be "Anzeigeblockierungen," thus affecting the clarity and correctness as stated in **Identify Mistranslations**.  	- "Maden" (maggots) is a severe mistranslation for "ads," which should be "Werbung," drastically altering the sentence's meaning under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Adblock → Abbblock → Adblock  	gotten around → eingehalten → umgehen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Abbblock" is likely a typographical error in the translation of "Adblock". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it incorrectly identifies the subject of the sentence.	2. "Eingehalten" (adhered to) is a mistranslation of "gotten around", which means to bypass or circumvent. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it changes the core action of the sentence from bypassing to complying.
open source → offenen Quellen → Open Source  	advertisement-blocking community → Blockiergemeinschaft → anzeigeblockierende Community  	circumventers → Umgehungsmanövern → Umgehern  		**Explanation:**  	1. "offenen Quellen" translates to "open sources," which may be unclear or incorrect in this context since "Open Source" is the widely accepted term in both English and German.	2. "Blockiergemeinschaft" is a mistranslation of "advertisement-blocking community." The reference uses "anzeigeblockierende Community," which more accurately captures the specific context of ad-blocking.	3. "Umgehungsmanövern" translates more closely to "circumvention maneuvers," which incorrectly alters the meaning compared to "circumventers" in this scenario. The reference uses "Umgehern," which refers to the individuals performing the action of circumventing.
world's → Welt → weltgrößte  	blockers → Blockierindustrie → Anzeigeblockierer  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Welt" (world) in the candidate translation is incorrectly used in a position suggesting "largest", hence "Welt" is compared to "weltgrößte". This mistranslation affects the meaning related to the nature of the company.	2. "Blockierindustrie" (blocking industry) is a mistranslation of "ad blockers", which alters the meaning by implying an industry rather than the tool itself, violating **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.
study → Studie → Untersuchung  	ad blockers → ad-blocks → Anzeigeblockierer  	nearly quadruple → fast vervierfacht sich → fast viermal so viel  		**Explanation:**  	- "Studie" is a direct translation of "study" and is correct, but "Untersuchung" is a more precise representation in the context of a formal research study, often used in conjunction with statistical results. However, this might be seen as an acceptable variation, focusing on context here.	- "ad-blocks" is not translated into German, and the correct term "Anzeigeblockierer" is necessary for proper understanding in German.  	- "fast vervierfacht sich" translates to "nearly quadrupled itself," which incorrectly implies the process, whereas "fast viermal so viel" correctly means "nearly four times as many." This is a significant contextual and numerical error.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both the candidate and reference translations convey the same meaning as the source sentence. The terms "Nutzer" vs. "Anwender" and the phrasing for "accounts for" and "now" are acceptable variations in the translation and do not significantly change the context or intent of the original sentence. The core meaning is preserved, so there are no significant single-word errors to report.
company → Unternehmen → Unternehmen		- "Unternehmen" is correctly translated from "company". No error detected here.		going after → setzt sich → hat es abgesehen		- "setzt sich" is an incorrect translation of "going after". The correct translation should be similar to "hat es abgesehen", which indicates targeting or going after ad blockers specifically. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		ad blockers → Blockaden → Anzeigenblockierer		- "Blockaden" means "blockades" and does not convey the specific meaning of "ad blockers". "Anzeigenblockierer" is the correct word, so this violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		desktop → durch → Desktop PCs		- "durch" (through) is not an appropriate translation for "desktop". The correct translation is "Desktop PCs". It violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it changes the context from a platform to a manner.		however, → jedoch → da		- "jedoch" is a suitable translation for "however," and no error is detected here.		because → weil → da		- "weil" (because) is correctly contrasted with "da" (since). There's no significant meaning change here, so no error is detected.		mobile ad blockers → mobile Blockiers → mobile Anzeigenblockierer		- "mobile Blockiers" is incorrect. "Blockiers" is not a valid German noun, while "Anzeigenblockierer" correctly conveys "ad blockers". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		are not effective → nicht wirksam sind → keine Wirkung haben		- "nicht wirksam sind" is a valid translation for "are not effective". It conveys the same sense of being ineffective, thus no error detected here.		Facebook's → Papieren → Facebooks		- "Papieren" (papers) is an incorrect translation of "Facebook's" when referring to apps. "Facebooks" correctly denotes possession. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.		mobile apps → mobilen Papieren → mobiler App		- "mobilen Papieren" (mobile papers) is incorrect. "mobiler App" (mobile app) correctly captures the meaning, significantly altering the context if not corrected. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		for the social network → für das soziale Netz → für das soziale Netzwerk		- "soziale Netz" is somewhat close but doesn't fully match the intended "soziale Netzwerk". This is more about stylistic choice rather than a significant meaning alteration, hence no error detected.		and → und → und		- Correct translation. No error detected.		Instagram → Instagram → Instagram		- Correct word in both languages. No error detected.		a → ein → ein		- The translation is correct for the indefinite article. No error detected.		spokesperson → Sprecher → Sprecher		- Correct translation from "spokesperson" to "Sprecher". No error detected.		said → sagte → mitteilte		- "sagte" (said) is a simpler form compared to "mitteilte" (reported, shared), but it remains contextually accurate. No error detected.		### **Compiled Mistranslations:**		(going after → setzt sich → hat es abgesehen)  	(ad blockers → Blockaden → Anzeigenblockierer)  	(desktop → durch → Desktop PCs)  	(mobile ad blockers → mobile Blockiers → mobile Anzeigenblockierer)  	(Facebook's → Papieren → Facebooks)  	(mobile apps → mobilen Papieren → mobiler App)  
desktop → Destop-Bads → Werbung  	ads → Destop-Bads → Werbung  	judged → hielt → erscheint  	such → die → eines solchen  	move → Investition → Schrittes  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Destop-Bads" is a mistranslation of "desktop ads." The correct term for "desktop ads" in German would be something related to "Werbung."	2. "Held" (kept) in the candidate translation is incorrect for "judged," which should be translated more as "appears" or "is seen as," represented by "erscheint" in the reference.	3. "Die" is an incorrect substitution for "such," which significantly alters the meaning as it doesn't refer back to something specific, as "eines solchen" does in the reference.	4. "Investition" (investment) is the same in both Candidate and Reference, but it incorrectly follows "such" when in fact "move" should be represented by "Schrittes" from the reference.
(ads → Maschen → Werbung)		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Maschen" (meshes), which is a mistranslation of "ads" in this context. The correct translation should be "Werbung" (advertisements), which aligns with the reference translation's representation of the targeted advertisements. This error is identified following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** instruction, as the concept being discussed involves advertising rather than something mechanical like meshes.
claimed → sagte → behauptete  	site → Standort → Seite  		**Explanation:**  	1. "sagte" (said) is a mistranslation of "claimed". The verb "behauptete" (claimed) captures the assertive nature of the action, aligning with **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.	2. "Standort" (location) is a mistranslation of "site". The correct term here should be "Seite" (site or page), adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Standort" implies a physical location rather than a website context.
people → Menschen → Nutzer  	issue → Thema → Problem  		**Explanation:**  	- "Menschen" (people) is a general term and not specific to Facebook users, potentially missing the intended context, while "Nutzer" (users) better captures the intended audience in this context. This error is addressed under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Thema" (theme/topic) is a less specific or accurate translation for "issue" in this context, which should be "Problem" (problem) as per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule. This is important as it significantly affects the meaning.
Ad blockers → Blockiers → Anzeigenblockierer  	instrument → Instrument → Mittel  	building → Aufbau → Entwicklertools  	people's → Menschen → Leute  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Blockiers" is a mistranslation of "Ad blockers". The correct term in German is "Anzeigenblockierer", which directly corresponds to the English term.	2. "Instrument" (instrument) is a literal mistranslation of "instrument" in context; the sentence implies a tool or method, correctly captured by "Mittel".	3. "Aufbau" (building) doesn't align with the context of creating tools. "Entwicklertools" (development tools) is the intended meaning when referring to the construction of tools like Ad Preferences.	4. "Menschen" translates generically to "people", but in context, "Leute" (more idiomatic for "people's hands") would be a better match for the preferences being controlled by the general public.
woman → Frauen → Frau  	run → fahren → überfahren  		**Explanation:** "Frauen" (women) is used instead of "Frau" (woman), which misrepresents the number of subjects involved, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Fahren" (to drive) is a mistranslation of "run over" which is correctly translated as "überfahren", violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule since it changes the action being described. The primary meaning here is someone being run over, not someone driving.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation matches the reference translation exactly. Each word corresponds directly and appropriately with the source sentence. This follows the rules set forth for identifying mistranslations, proving the sentence translation is both contextually and semantically accurate.
No translation errors detected.
A1 → am → auf der  		**Explanation:** "am" (at) is a mistranslation in the context of highways, where "auf der" (on the) is commonly used in German. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as highways are typically referred to with "auf der" in German.
woman → Frau, die → Frau  	lay → lag → legte sich  	hit → getroffen → wurden getroffen  	vehicles → Fahrzeugen → Autos  	said → sagte → aus  		**Explanation:** 	- "Frau, die" (woman who) is a mistranslation of "woman". "Frau" without "die" would be the correct translation, following the focus rule for single-word errors.	- "lag" (lay) is a mistranslation of "lay down". "legte sich" correctly conveys the action of lying down.	- "getroffen" (hit) is a mistranslation in terms of the grammatical number. "Wurden getroffen" is the correct passive form for multiple subjects (several vehicles).	- "Fahrzeugen" (vehicles) versus "Autos" (cars). Though "vehicles" was translated into "Fahrzeugen", the source and reference sentences use more straightforward "Autos", focusing on specificity.	- "sagte" (said) versus "aus" (stated). The reference uses "aus" to indicate the official nature of the statement, which provides clearer context.		These errors significantly change the context and meaning of the sentence, failing to accurately convey the events described.
Clearly → Um → offensichtlich  		**Explanation:** "Um" (to) is a mistranslation of "Clearly." The candidate translation turns a phrase indicating certainty into one merely indicating intent (without the nuance of certainty provided in the source and reference sentences). This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it significantly alters the understanding of the situation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "starb" (died) and "verstarb" (passed away) are both acceptable translations for the context and do not alter the meaning. Additionally, "vor Ort" (at the scene) directly corresponds to its reference. Hence, no significant mistranslation is identified, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the meaning of the source sentence well. Words like "beteiligten" for "involved", "befragt" for "interviewed", "nicht identifiziert" for "unidentified", and "aufruft" for "calling for" fit contextually and convey the intended meaning. There are no significant single-word mistranslations impacting the sentence's message.
investigation → Untersuchung → Ermittlungsverfahren  	opened → eingeleitet → eröffnet  	lawyer → Rechtsanwalt → (omitted in reference translation)		**Explanation:**  	1. "Untersuchung" is a mistranslation of "investigation." While it is not incorrect in isolation, in the given context, "Ermittlungsverfahren" is more precise and appropriate for a criminal investigation, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "eingeleitet" is a mistranslation of "opened." Although both can mean to start or initiate, "eröffnet" is the more accurate term here, changing the nuance of the sentence under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	3. The word "lawyer" is translated correctly as "Rechtsanwalt," but it's omitted in the reference translation. Since "Rechtsanwalt" does not violate any meaning or contextual rules, we include it for completeness but note that it may be considered superfluous given the reference.
drivers → betroffenen Fahrer → Fahrer  	charges → Gebühren → angezeigt  		**Explanation:** "betroffenen Fahrer" (affected drivers) is a mistranslation of "drivers" because "betroffenen" adds an unnecessary implication that does not exist in the source sentence. "Gebühren" (fees) is a mistranslation of "charges" in this context because "Gebühren" refers to monetary fees, while "charges" in the context of the sentence refers to legal charges, which is "angezeigt" in German.
impact → Auswirkungen → Zusammenstoß		**Explanation:** "Auswirkungen" (effects/consequences) is a mistranslation of "impact" in this context, as the reference clearly indicates "Zusammenstoß" (collision/impact) which refers more closely to a physical or direct impact. This fits the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because the incorrect word changes the nature of what was to be avoided.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While there are slight differences in structure ("Darüber" vs. "Das ist etwas, was"), both versions convey the meaning of what the prosecutor must determine. The core focus is on the action the prosecutor must undertake, and "entscheiden" (decide) effectively translates "determine". Additionally, the slight misspelling of "Hofsteter" does not constitute a translation error. Therefore, there are no meaningful single-word translation errors according to the instructions.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. Both "deuten darauf hin" and "zeigen" accurately reflect the implication of the source word "suggest" in this context. Other elements like "similar cases", "past five years", and "drivers will not be held responsible" are consistently translated, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and maintains contextual accuracy with the reference translation. Although "einschätzen" and "entschieden" are different words for "judged/decided," both convey a correct interpretation in this context. Similarly, "unterwegs" and "lief" both refer to moving or walking. Therefore, there are no significant meaning changes or important translation errors.
police officer → Polizeibeamter → Polizistin  	acquitted → zum Tode verurteilt → freigesprochen  	causing death by negligence → durch Fahrlässigkeit → fahrlässigen Tötung  	hit → lag → überfahren  	Paynerne → Paynernennacht → Payerne  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Polizeibeamter" is a mistranslation of "police officer" because of gender; the reference specifies "Polizistin" (female officer).	2. "zum Tode verurteilt" (sentenced to death) is the opposite of "acquitted", which is "freigesprochen" in German.	3. "durch Fahrlässigkeit" suggests causing death by negligence, but it is not specific to the charge; "fahrlässigen Tötung" (negligent manslaughter) is more precise.	4. "lag" does not translate "hit"; the reference uses "überfahren" (ran over/hit).	5. "Paynernennacht" seems like a concatenated mistranslation of "Payerne", possibly due to a context handling error. "Payerne" is the correct name as in the reference.
drinking → getrunken → hatte getrunken  	passed out → gegangen → bewusstlos geworden  		**Explanation:** "getrunken" (drunk) is a mistranslation because it lacks the auxiliary "hatte" (had) which gives the proper past perfect meaning as intended by "had been drinking," following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule. "gegangen" (gone) is a mistranslation of "passed out," which changes the meaning significantly, as being "gone" indicates movement rather than losing consciousness. This identifies errors under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** principle.
policewoman → Polizist → Polizistin  	responding → reagierte → geantwortet  		**Explanation:** "Polizist" (policeman) is a mistranslation of "policewoman," which changes the gender context of the sentence. This falls under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "reagierte" (responded) is generally correct, but the reference uses "geantwortet" (answered) with the past perfect tense. However, the latter doesn't significantly change the overall meaning, so it could be acceptable, but the mismatch with tense might be more relevant in a broader context.
information → informiert → Informationen  	083 → 646 → 83  	46 → (missing) → 46  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "informiert" (informed) which changes the intended meaning of "information" in this context, leading to a misunderstanding about who should call. The phone number "021 644 83 46" is incorrectly rendered as "021 644 646" in the candidate sentence, altering the critical contact information significantly. The last part of the phone number "021 644 83 46" is missing, breaking the complete contact detail.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "NASA Klimamodell: Venus war einst bewohnbar" is identical to the reference translation and accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. There are no discrepancies in single-word translations that significantly change the meaning, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
Venus → Veneus → Venus  	projections → Vorhersagen → Projektionen  		**Explanation:** "Veneus" is a typographical error for "Venus," which is a significant error in this context as it alters the meaning of the sentence. The candidate translation uses "Vorhersagen" (predictions) instead of "Projektionen" (projections), which significantly changes the meaning in the context of scientific modeling, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence into German. The variations in phrasing, such as "im Goddard-Institut für Weltraumstudien" and "am Goddard Institute for Space Studies", or "mit Instrumenten und Algorithmen" and "anhand von Tools und Algorithmen", are acceptable in context and do not alter the intended meaning. Therefore, there are no significant single-word translation errors according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
Venus → Venus → die Venus  	water-less → wasserfreien → wasserlosen  	chocked → Schockatmosphäre → dichten  	Earth-like → Erdbedingungen → erdähnliche  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Venus" is translated correctly, but it lacks the definite article "die" which is essential in German to maintain the proper grammatical structure and ensure accuracy in this context.	2. "wasserfreien" (water-free) does not accurately convey "water-less," which is more precisely "wasserlos" in this context.	3. "Schockatmosphäre" (shock atmosphere) is a mistranslation of "chocked," where the intended meaning is an atmosphere dense with CO2, better captured by "dichten" (dense).	4. "Erdbedingungen" (Earth conditions) does not specifically convey "Earth-like," which suggests similarity to Earth, better captured by "erdähnliche."
suggested → angedeutet → hingedeutet  	rate → Rotationsrate → Umdrehung  	its → seine → ihre  	thick → dicke → dichte  		**Explanation:**  	1. "angedeutet" (implied/suggested) is a mistranslation of "suggested". "hingedeutet" (indicated) is closer to the reference translation and the intended meaning, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.  	2. "Rotationsrate" is overly specific and does not align precisely with the context provided by "Umdrehung" (rotation), following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.  	3. "seine" (his) is incorrect as it refers to Venus, which is feminine in German, and thus it should be "ihre" (her), following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.  	4. "dicke" (thick) is a plausible translation for "thick", but "dichte" (dense) conveys the specific characteristic relevant to the atmosphere better, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
suggests → deuten → deutet  	Venus → Venus → die Venus  	earth-like → weltähnliche → erdähnliche  	spun → springen → weiterdrehte  		**Explanation:**  	- "deuten" is a mistranslation of "suggests", as it changes the verb from a singular form to a plural form, affecting grammatical agreement. The error lies in the verb form.	- "Venus" (without the article "die") is a subtle but important error since "die Venus" is needed for proper noun treatment in German.	- "weltähnliche" (world-like) is a mistranslation of "earth-like", altering the intended comparison specifically to Earth.	- "springen" (jump) is a mistranslation of "spun" since the actions are conceptually different. In the context of the celestial body rotating, "weiterdrehte" (continue spinning) is the accurate translation.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Das Modell betrachtete auch die Topografie des frühen Venus." closely aligns with the reference translation "Das Modell beleuchtete auch die Topographie der frühen Venus." The slight variations such as "betrachtete" vs. "beleuchtete" (both can imply examining) and "Topografie" vs. "Topographie" (a spelling variation) do not significantly change the meaning of the sentence. The context remains intact, fitting the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
likely → wahrscheinlich → vermutlich  	variability → Vielfalt → Variabilität  	guard → schützen → schützte  		**Explanation:**  	- "wahrscheinlich" (likely) is a mistranslation of "vermutlich" (presumedly), as it does not fit the specific conjunctive sense used here.  	- "Vielfalt" (diversity) is a mistranslation of "variability" (which is more about variation rather than diversity).  	- "schützen" (to protect/defend) is not incorrect in isolation but does not convey the past tense intended by "schützte" (guarded), especially since the context suggests historical defense.
dimmer → dimmer → matter  		**Explanation:** "dimmer" was retained from English and should have been translated to "matter" in German to convey the intended meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "30 percent" and "30%" are equivalent in this context, so there is no error with the numerical representation.
slow spin → langsame Verfall → langsame Umdrehung  	Venus → von Venus → der Venus  	dayside → die Sonne → ihre Tagesseite  	scientist → Wissenschaftlerin → Wissenschaftler  	news release → Mitteilung → Pressemitteilung  		**Explanation:** 	1. "langsame Verfall" (slow decay) is a mistranslation of "slow spin", mistakenly implying deterioration instead of rotation. This follows the **Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "von Venus" (of Venus) should be "der Venus" in this context to correctly indicate possession. This applies the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	3. "die Sonne" (the sun) incorrectly translates "dayside", which should be "ihre Tagesseite" to preserve the intended meaning. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	4. "Wissenschaftlerin" (female scientist) is incorrect since the reference specifies "GISS Wissenschaftler" (male scientist) Anthony Del Genio. This adheres to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	5. "Mitteilung" (announcement) lacks the specific context of "news release", which is better captured by "Pressemitteilung". This adheres to the **Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the context of the communication type.
heating → Energie → Wärme		**Explanation:** The source word "heating" refers to "Wärme" (heat) in the context, whereas "Energie" (energy) in the candidate translation represents a less precise term here, which does not convey the specific concept of heat. Therefore, it violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
mean → Klimatemperatur → Durchschnitt  	cooler → külter → kühler  		**Explanation:** "Klimatemperatur" (climate temperature) is a mistranslation of "mean" in this context, which refers to average, not a specific type of temperature. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it changes the intended measure. "külter" is a typo for "kühler" (cooler), causing a significant change in the standard language, thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
1. model → Modell → Modell  	2. Venus → Venus → Venus  	3. previously → früher → zuvor  	4. planetary → Weltwissenschaftlern → Planetenforschern  		**Explanation:** 		- "Modell" is the correct translation for "model", so no error here.	- "Venus" is correctly translated, matching both candidate and reference.	- "früher" (earlier) and "zuvor" (before) are not synonymous, and "zuvor" better matches the temporal context of "previously," but since they can overlap contextually, this could be treated as a subtle nuance if not focusing strictly on meaning change.	- "Weltwissenschaftlern" (world scientists) is a mistranslation of "planetary scientists" as it incorrectly suggests a broader field of science unrelated to planets. The correct term "Planetenforschern" matches the reference and aligns specifically with the planetary context. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
ultraviolet → Ultraviolet → ultraviolettem  	light → [Omitted] → Licht  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Ultraviolet" is used as a noun in the candidate translation but should be translated as an adjective "ultraviolettem" when referring to light in German. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Ultraviolet" (as a noun) doesn't accurately reflect the intended meaning.	2. Although "light" is omitted in the candidate sentence and "Licht" is used in the reference, the key error is primarily with "ultraviolet" not being translated as an adjective. The focus is on the mistranslation of "ultraviolet," and addressing "light" indirectly resolves this key error, adhering to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
evaporated → verflüchteten → verdunsteten  	vapor → Wasservakuum → Wasserdampf  		**Explanation:**  	- "verflüchteten" (escaped) is a mistranslation of "evaporated". In this context, "evaporated" specifically refers to a phase change from liquid to gas, best expressed by "verdunsteten" in German.	- "Wasservakuum" (water vacuum) is a mistranslation of "water vapor" which should be "Wasserdampf". This is a contextually significant error as it changes the physical state of water being described, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
hydrogen → Wasserstoff → Hydrogen  	that → nur → noch  	Venus → der → die  		**Explanation:**  	- "Wasserstoff" (hydrogen) is typically acceptable, but considering "Hydrogen" (with a capital "H") is used in the reference, suggesting a possible error given name treatment or a specific context in this particular text.	- "nur" used alone does not convey the full extent of "all that was left," as "nur noch" would accurately express "only left."	- "der Venus" (masculine article) is incorrect, as "die Venus" (feminine article) is the proper usage for the planet name Venus, according to German grammatical gender norms.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the meaning of the source sentence. While the phrase "Geophysical Research Letters" is translated as "Geophysikalische Forschungsschreiben" in the candidate, this is an acceptable translation, and such translations of journal names may vary. Therefore, no single word represents a significant error, aligning this with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
coach → Kraftomnibusse → Trainer  		**Explanation:** "Kraftomnibusse" (buses) is a mistranslation of "coach" in the context of a sports team. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Kraftomnibusse" is completely unrelated to the intended meaning of a sports coach.
coach → Bus- und Fahrstuhlvorsitzender → Trainer  	vice president → Fahrstuhlvorsitzender → Vice President Of Hockey Operations  	citing → zitierte → führte  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Bus- und Fahrstuhlvorsitzender" (bus and elevator chairman) is a mistranslation of "coach", which should be "Trainer". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the candidate translation doesn't make sense in the context of hockey roles.	2. "Fahrstuhlvorsitzender" (elevator chairman) is a mistranslation of "vice president", which should be "Vice President Of Hockey Operations". This also violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it provides an unrelated position in the context of hockey operations.	3. "zitierte" (quoted) is a mistranslation of "citing", which should be "führte". The reference uses "führte" (led/pointed to), which aligns with the context of explaining his resignation.
executive → stellvertretende → Alternativ  	coach → Bus → Trainer  		**Explanation:** "stellvertretende" (deputy) is a mistranslation of "executive", which changes the hierarchy of the position. "Bus" (bus) is a significant mistranslation of "coach" in this context, where it should refer to a sports coach, not a vehicle.
1. head coach → Chefbus → Cheftrainer	2. vice president → stellvertretender Vorsitzender → Vice President		**Explanation:**		- "Chefbus" is not a meaningful translation in this context. The correct translation should be "Cheftrainer" for "head coach", addressing the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "stellvertretender Vorsitzender" is a mistranslation of "Vice President", which significantly changes the structure and level of the position. It should be "Vice President" to maintain accuracy, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. Words and phrases such as "lange und gründlich" for "long and hard", and "im Laufe des Sommers" for "over the course of the summer," fit contextually and maintain the sentence’s integrity. The minor variations between the candidate and reference translations ("kann" vs. "könnte," "erforderliche" vs. "mehr") represent acceptable variations or contextually valid choices, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
coach → Kraftomnibusverkehrs → Trainers  	VP-hockey operations → VP-Hockey-Operationen → Vice President Of Hockey Operations  		**Explanation:** "Kraftomnibusverkehrs" (bus transportation) is a mistranslation for "coach", which should be "Trainers" in this context. "VP-Hockey-Operationen" (VP-Hockey-Operations) is a literal translation but lacks the clarity and specificity of "Vice President Of Hockey Operations", which is needed for contextual accuracy.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the intended meaning and context of the source sentence without significant deviation from the meaning in the reference translation. The variations in wording do not result in a meaningful change in meaning, therefore, no single-word translation errors are detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and the reference translation express the same meaning. Although "gegenwärtig" (currently) and "momentan" (currently) are different German words, they both convey the same idea in this context. Thus, in adherence to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no errors are reported since the meaning is preserved.
Sakic → Sakaki → Sakic  	hired → eingestellt → angeheuert  	thanked → dankte → bedankte sich
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** All words in the candidate translation align well with the source sentence and reference translation. "Entscheidung" and "decision," "Sakak" and "Sakic" are correctly placed in context without significant shifts in meaning that would warrant a mistranslation report. The change from "these" to "his" in "seine Entscheidung" is contextually acceptable, considering both convey possession relating back to Patrick's decision. Thus, as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules, no significant translation errors have been committed.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with the reference translation. The words "viel Glück" (much luck) and "nur das Beste" (only the best) convey similar well-wishing sentiments in this context, demonstrating acceptable variation. Thus, there are no meaningful single-word errors per the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** instruction.
Jack Adams Award → Jack Adams Award → Jack Adams Awards  	rookie → Spaisesaison → Debütsaison  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Jack Adams Award" should be "Jack Adams Awards". The source and reference both use the plural form "Awards", which is the correct name for the award; hence, the single form "Award" in the candidate translation is incorrect.		2. "Spaisesaison" is a mistranslation of "rookie season". The correct term in this context should be "Debütsaison" as per the reference translation. "Spaisesaison" is not a valid translation and could potentially be a nonsensical or placeholder word in German. This changes the intended meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
guided → leitete → führte  	club → Club → Verein  	first-place → erste → ersten Platz  	finish → Ende → Platz  	Central Division → Zentralstelle → Central Vision  	round → Runde → Runde  	playoffs → Plakate → Playoffs  	upset → gestört → geschlagen  	missed → verließ → verpasste  	postseason → Postsaison → Nachsaison  		**Explanation:** 	- "leitete" (managed) is not as accurate as "führte" (guided) in this context. 	- "Club" can be used, but "Verein" (club/team) is more appropriate here since it matches the reference.	- "erste Ende" (first end) does not convey the correct meaning of "first-place finish," where "ersten Platz" (first place) is needed.	- "Zentralstelle" (central office) is incorrect; it should be "Central Division" as in the reference.	- "Plakate" (posters) is an incorrect translation of "playoffs."	- "gestört" (disturbed) does not match the sense of being defeated or "upset" in a sports context, indicating "geschlagen" (beaten) is appropriate.	- "verließ" (left) does not imply missing the postseason, where "verpasste" (missed) fits correctly.	- "Postsaison" is a possible translation of "postseason," but stylized translations like "Nachsaison" are preferred in German sports terminology.
Avalanche → Avalanche → Avalanches  	ausgesandt → ausgesandt → verzeichneten  	vor → vor → hinter  	Windkartenplatz → Windkartenplatz → Wildcard Spot  		**Explanation:**  		1. "Avalanche" is a mistranslation because in the context of a team, it should be pluralized as "Avalanches".	2. "ausgesandt" (sent out) is a mistranslation of "posted". The correct word here is "verzeichneten" (recorded).	3. "vor" (in front of) changes the meaning as the source sentence indicates they fell short ("fell behind"), thus it should be "hinter" (behind).	4. "Windkartenplatz" is a misspelling or mistranslation of "wild-card spot," which should be "Wildcard Spot".
Hall → Galender → Fame  	apiece → Apfel → Stücke  		**Explanation:** "Galender" is a mistranslation of "Hall", which does not make sense in the context of "Hall of Fame." This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Apfel" (apple) is a mistranslation of "apiece" (per unit/each), which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
resume → unterbrechen → setzen  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "unterbrechen" (interrupt) for "resume", which does not convey the correct action of resuming talks. The correct translation should mirror "setzen" (set, in the context of "set aside" or "pause"). This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, highlighting a significant error that changes the sentence meaning.
Labor → Arbeitskämpfe → Arbeitskämpfe  	pay → Bezahlung → Entlohnung  		**Explanation:** "Labor" was translated as "Laborstreiks," which is a deviation from the source concept "Labor strikes" and the correct translation "Arbeitskämpfe." "Bezahlung" contrasts from the reference usage "Entlohnung," as the connotation of "pay" in the given context of labor disputes more closely aligns with "Entlohnung."
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Each word and phrase, such as "sporadically on platforms in the North Sea" and "operated by Royal Dutch Shell," is properly translated, and there are no mistranslations that significantly alter the intended meaning. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation does not contain any significant single-word mistranslations that would alter the intended meaning of the source sentence, adhering to the **Identify Mistranslations** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules. Words such as "können bestätigen" (can confirm), "geeinigt haben" (agreed), and "wieder in Gang zu setzen" (restart) maintain the overall sense of the sentence, and acceptable variations are ignored as per the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** guideline.
number → Reihe → einige  	full-day → Volltagstreffen → ganztägige Sitzungen  	take a fresh look → erneut → neu anzugehen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Reihe" (series) is used instead of "einige" (a number of), which changes the quantity or scope implied, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	2. "Volltagstreffen" (full-day meetings) is close in meaning but differs from "ganztägige Sitzungen" (which also means full-day sessions). However, contextually, the intent may allow for different interpretations, and this may not be a significant error, so it's noted with consideration of potential variation.	3. "erneut mit den Problemen zu beschäftigen" (to engage with the problems again) does not capture the intended nuance of "to take a fresh look", making "erneut" an inaccurate translation for "fresh look at", violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the meaning of the source sentence without any significant single-word errors. The terms "Arbeitergewerkschaften" and "Gewerkschaften" both refer to unions, and while the candidate uses a more specific term, it doesn't change the overall meaning significantly. Other key components of the sentence, such as "jüngste Aktion" and "letzter Streik," are also acceptable variations in this context. The message and intent of the original sentence are effectively conveyed by the candidate, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Wood Group → Holzgruppe → Wood Group		**Explanation:** "Holzgruppe" (Wood Group) is a mistranslation of "Wood Group" since it incorrectly substitutes the company's name with a literal German translation, altering the proper noun. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because company names should remain consistent across translations.
rate → Unternehmensquote → Raten  	onshore → Offshore → Onshore  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Unternehmensquote" (company's quota) is a mistranslation of "rate". The candidate translation inaccurately refers to a quota, which does not convey the intended financial context of "rate" in this instance.	   	2. "Offshore" in the candidate translation is the opposite of "Onshore". This significantly changes the meaning by mistakenly attributing the rate reduction to "offshore" contractors instead of the correct "onshore" contractors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "den nötigen Spielraum geben" for "the room needed," which is a contextual and meaningful equivalent to "den benötigten Raum gibt" in the reference. The meanings of the source sentence components are preserved. Both "Abschwung des Marktes" and "Marktabschwung" accurately translate "market downturn." As the overall meaning is maintained without significant deviation, and the translation aligns with a correct understanding of the sentence, no translation errors are identified.
trimmed → getrocknet → entlassen	people → Menschen → Leuten	payroll → Gehältern → keine direkte Übersetzung benötigt	operations → Operationen → Geschäftstätigkeiten	energy company → Energieunternehmen → Energieunternehmen  		**Explanation:**  	- **trimmed → getrocknet → entlassen:** "Getrocknet" (dried) is a mistranslation of "trimmed," which should mean "entlassen" (laid off or removed), as in reducing the workforce.	- **people → Menschen → Leuten:** "Menschen" is a close synonym to "Leuten," but "Leuten" fits the context better as it is a more natural choice in this sentence.	- **payroll → Gehältern → keine direkte Übersetzung benötigt:** "Gehältern" (salaries) is incorrectly used as a direct translation of "payroll." The correct understanding doesn't match a word-for-word German term; it's process-focused here, related to reducing workforce rather than handling salaries.	- **operations → Operationen → Geschäftstätigkeiten:** "Operationen" translates to a narrow industrial operation context, while the broader "Geschäftstätigkeiten" fits the context of business operations better.	- **energy company → Energieunternehmen → Energieunternehmen:** Although "Energieunternehmen" is correct for "energy company," the candidate translation missed the "Group" in "BG Group," which should be intact in context, but since it wasn't a word changed, it's not listed as an error.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although there are differences in phrasing between the candidate and reference translations, such as "stehen unter dem Druck" versus "befinden sich aufgrund", these are acceptable variations that do not significantly alter the meaning. Therefore, according to the guidelines of focusing on significant single-word errors and prioritizing meaningful errors, no translation errors are reported.
Member → Abgeordnete → Parlamentsmitglied  	labor → Laborführern → Arbeiterführern  		**Explanation:** 		1. **Member:** The candidate's translation of "Member" as "Abgeordnete" does not accurately convey the specific role of a "Member of Parliament." The reference term "Parlamentsmitglied" more directly denotes a legislator.		2. **labor:** The translation "Laborführern" diverges from the intended meaning of "labor leaders." In this context, "labor" relates to industrial or union-related "Arbeiterführern" rather than "Labor," which can ambiguously denote a laboratory or research context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the intended meaning of the source sentence. The difference in word order between the candidate and reference ("sagte er" placement) does not significantly alter the meaning, thus not violating any instructions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation correctly conveys the meaning of the source sentence in the grammar and vocabulary used. The words "brauchen" and "benötigen" are both accurately representing "need", providing an acceptable variation. Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, there are no significant translation errors to report.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence adequately. The main concepts such as the amounts, the location, and the comparison over time remain consistent with the source and reference sentences. While there is a difference in the structure and some expressions, they do not result in a significant change in meaning, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
measures → Maßnahmen → misst  	spin → spritzen → Rotationsrate  	rates → Sternraten → von Sternen  	cluster → aus → Sternenhaufen  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Maßnahmen" (actions/measures) does not capture the function of "measures" in the context of measuring something quantitatively, which is "misst" in German.	2. "spritzen" (splash/spray) is not a suitable translation for "spin" which refers to the rotational movement, termed "Rotationsrate" in German.	3. "Sternraten" (star rates) is an incorrect translation of "rates" in this context. The correct term would relate to the motion of stars, expressed as "von Sternen" in German.	4. "aus" (out) is an incorrect translation of "cluster," which here refers to an astrophysical grouping, expressed as "Sternenhaufen" in German.
most → Spitzenraten → Rotationsraten  	Pleiades → Pleidas → Plejaden  		**Explanation:** "Spitzenraten" (peak rates) is a mistranslation of "spin rates", which refers to the rotational speed of stars. "Pleidas" is a mistranslation and misspelling of "Pleiades", which refers to a specific star cluster. These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Identify Mistranslations** rules as they introduce incorrect scientific terms.
stars → Stars → Sterne  	cluster → Streubomben → Sternenhaufen  	planet → Welt → Planeten  		**Explanation:**  	- "Stars" is a transliteration and not a contextually appropriate translation; the correct German word is "Sterne", adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Streubomben" (cluster bombs) is contextually incorrect and does not translate the intended meaning of a group of stars ("cluster"), which relates to "Sternenhaufen", violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Welt" (world) is a mistranslation for "planet", which changes the context; the correct term in this case is "Planeten", indicating a translation error as per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
star clusters → Star-Clustern → Sternenhaufen  	research scientist → Forschungswissenschaftler → Forscherin  	Infrared Processing and Analysis Center → Information processing and Analyse-Center → Infrared Processing and Analysis Center  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Star-Clustern" does not accurately translate "star clusters" as it retains part of the English phrase. The reference uses "Sternenhaufen," which is the correct term in German.	2. "Forschungswissenschaftler" is a gender-neutral term that can work for "research scientist", but the reference uses "Forscherin", focusing on the correct gender-specific term ("eine" was used indicating it should be feminine).	3. "Information processing and Analyse-Center" is a direct mistranslation of "Infrared Processing and Analysis Center," which is not translated in the reference as it is a proper name.
Pleiades → Plediads → Plejaden		**Explanation:** "Plediads" is a mistranslation of "Pleiades", which is incorrectly transliterated instead of using the proper German term "Plejaden".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The key elements in the candidate translation align closely with the reference translation and source sentence. "Stars" is accurately translated to "Sterne", "cluster" to "Cluster", "reaching adulthood" to "erreichen...das Erwachsenenalter", and the time reference "125 million years ago" is maintained. The phrase "having been born" is captured correctly in context with "geboren wurden". The meaning of the sentence is preserved correctly, and acceptable variations do not constitute significant translation errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In this sentence, "spinnen" can mean "to spin" when discussing motion. The candidate translation conveys the sentence's overall meaning well, and both translations imply a sense of maximum speed. Although the wording differs, no significant single-word translation errors change the sentence's intended meaning. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, considering both translations acceptable.
peak → Spitzenspitzen → Spitzenrotationsraten  	eject → pumpen → stoßen aus  	stellar → stiflen → Sternwinden  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Spitzenspitzen" (peak peaks) is not an appropriate translation for "peak spin rates." The correct context is about the rate or speed of spinning, which "Spitzenrotationsraten" captures accurately.	2. "pumpen" (pump) does not accurately convey the meaning of "eject" in the context of stellar actions. The stars are releasing or expelling material, which is best captured by the term "stoßen aus."	3. "stiflen" does not exist in German and is a typographical error for "stellar," which should be translated as "Sternwinden" to reflect "stellar wind."
(Stars → Stars → Sterne)  	enact → wirken → haben  	braking → Bremsen → bremsenden  		**Explanation:**  	- "Stars" in the candidate should be translated as "Sterne". It's retained from the source language, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it is not appropriately translated into German.	- "enact" is mistranslated as "wirken" rather than the more accurate "haben" in this context. This alters the meaning and relevance of the action taken by the winds, as per **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.	- "braking" is mistranslated as "Bremsen" which is a noun (brakes), whereas in the reference, "bremsenden" is an adjective modifying the effect, reflecting a more accurate representation. This aligns with the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
star → Sterne → Stern  	spin → Spitzenrate → Rotationsrate  		**Explanation:** "Sterne" (stars) is a mistranslation of "star" since the singular form is used in the source sentence. "Spitzenrate" (peak rate) is a mistranslation of "spin rate", which alters the intended meaning. The correct term should be "Rotationsrate" (rotation rate) to reflect the concept of a celestial object's angular motion slowing with age.
star's → Sterne → Sterns  	measures → Maßnahmen → misst  	starspots → Starts → Sternenflecks  		**Explanation:**  	- "Sterne" is a mistranslation of "star's" (singular possessive), which should be "Sterns" to match the singular and possessive context.	- "Maßnahmen" (measures as in actions taken) is a mistranslation of "measures" (as in the act of measuring), which changes the meaning of the sentence. The correct translation should be "misst."	- "Starts" is a mistranslation of "starspots," which should be "Sternenflecks," significantly changing the meaning in context.
spin → ausbrechen → drehen  		**Explanation:** "ausbrechen" (break out) is a mistranslation of "spin", which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because breaking out is not the same as rotating or spinning. The correct term in context should be "drehen".
stars → Stars → Sterne  	dancers → Tanzern → Tänzern  	Rebull → Rebellen → Rebull  		**Explanation:**  	- "Stars" (famous people) in German should be "Sterne" (celestial bodies) as used in the reference, changing the context from people to celestial objects.	- "Tanzern" should be "Tänzern" with the umlaut, which ensures both grammatical accuracy and better captures the intended meaning of the source sentence.	- "Rebellen" (rebels) is a mistranslation of "Rebull" (a proper noun), which changes the identity of the subject being discussed.
rotators → Rotatoren → Rotoren  	fastest → Lichtsterne → schnellere  		**Explanation:** "Rotatoren" is a mistranslation of "rotators" as it doesn't convey the concept accurately, which is "Rotoren." This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Lichtsterne" (light stars) is not equivalent to what is meant by "the fastest rotators," which should be closer to "schnellere" (faster), as the context refers to "speed" rather than "light in weight or luminosity," addressing the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
Pleiades → Pleidas → Plejaden  	cluster → Cluster → Sternenhaufen  	stellar → Stückwerte → stellare  	spin → Spitzenzöllen → Rotationsraten  		**Explanation:**  	- "Pleidas" is a mistranslation of "Pleiades", which should be translated as "Plejaden".	- "Cluster" should have been translated as "Sternenhaufen" to match the correct astronomical term in German.	- "Stückwerte" (piece values) is an incorrect translation for "stellar qualities", which should be translated as "stellare Qualitäten".	- "Spitzenzöllen" (peak duties) is incorrect for "spin rates". The correct translation in context is "Rotationsraten". These errors change the specific and scientific nature of the description, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
Pleiades → Pleiaden → Plejaden  	star → Star → Sternenhaufen  	stellar → stillarer → stellaren  		**Explanation:** 	- "Pleiades" is a proper noun referring to a specific star cluster, and in German, it is translated as "Plejaden."	- "star" should be translated as "Sternenhaufen," which specifically means "star cluster," thus maintaining the contextual meaning.	- "stellar" is mistranslated as "stillarer," which is not a valid German word. The correct translation is "stellaren."
stars → Sterne → Sterne  	spin rates → Spitzenzinsen → Rotationsraten  		**Explanation:** "Spitzenzinsen" (peak interest rates) is a mistranslation of "spin rates" (Rotationsraten), which significantly alters the meaning of the sentence. "Sterne" (stars) is correctly translated, so no error is noted for "stars." Other parts of the candidate sentence do not contain errors that significantly change the meaning when compared to the source and reference sentences.
spin rates → Analyse → Rotationsraten  	papers → Dokumenten → Zeitungsberichten  	Journal → Amtsblatt → Journal  		**Explanation:** "Analyse" is a mistranslation of "spin rates", as it changes the focus from a scientific measurement to a more general term, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Dokumenten" (documents) is a mistranslation for "papers" meant as scientific articles or reports, which could significantly alter the context of publication. "Amtsblatt" (official bulletin) does not appropriately translate "Journal" in this specific academic context, where "Journal" refers to a scientific journal, as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
baseball → Basel → Baseball	star → Sterner → Star	steps → [missing] → tritt  	down → [missing] → ab  		**Explanation:** "Basel" is a mistranslation of "baseball", which significantly affects the intended meaning (a sports term), violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "Sterner" is a mistranslation of "star", a crucial term that refers to a celebrity in sports. Lastly, the words "steps down" are completely missing in the candidate translation, impacting the sentence's core meaning. Each inaccuracy follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by identifying the most critical incorrect word for each concept.
baseball → Basel → Baseball 	star → Stern → Star  		**Explanation:** "Basel" is an incorrect translation of "baseball," likely stemming from confusion with the city name. "Stern" (which means star as in a celestial body) is a mistranslation in this context, as "star" refers to a famous athlete, and should be "Star" in German. Both these mistranslations significantly affect the sentence's meaning, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
41-year-old pro → 41-jährige Pro → 41 Jahre alte Profi  	New York Yankees jersey → New Yankees-Jankeesy → Trikot seiner New York Yankees  	Tampa Bay Rays → Tampa-Bucht → Tampa Bay Rays  		**Explanation:**  	- "41-jährige Pro" is a gender and contextually incorrect translation of "41-year-old pro," altering the meaning because "Pro" is incomplete and not in appropriate agreement; "der 41 Jahre alte Profi" is the correct form.	- "New Yankees-Jankeesy" is a mistranslation of "New York Yankees jersey," likely due to a typo or recognition error, significantly changing the description of the clothing item.	- "Tampa-Bucht" (Tampa Bay translated literally as "Tampa Bay") does not capture the team name "Tampa Bay Rays," altering the intended meaning and not signifying the team.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation matches the reference translation exactly, maintaining both the meaning and word choices from the source sentence properly. Therefore, there are no single-word translation errors as per the provided guidelines.
All Star → Star → All-Star-Game-Teilnehmer		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Star" is a mistranslation of "All Star." In the context of Major League Baseball, "All-Star" refers to a player selected for the All-Star Game, which is an important distinction not captured by "Star." This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as the distinction is significant in sports terminology.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence. Each significant term, such as "most valuable player" ("wertvollster Akteur") and "World Series" ("Weltserie"), is represented correctly in the candidate, maintaining the clear intent and context of the original sentence. Both translations are within acceptable variations, satisfying the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and the reference translation convey the same meaning; there are no single-word mistranslations that change the meaning of the original sentence. The minor differences in phrasing do not result in significant meaning changes, complying with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Both translations accurately reflect the source sentence's content.
contract → Abschluss → Ende  	coach → Jugendbus → Jugendcoach  		**Explanation:**  	- "Abschluss" (conclusion) is a mistranslation of "end", which creates a meaning that indicates a different point in time. This is a significant change from the intended cessation of the contract.	- "Jugendbus" (youth bus) is a mistranslation of "youth coach", which in this context refers to a person, not a bus, indicating a clear semantic error.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Rodriguez hat das schon längst mit Leistung bezahlt" conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence. The variations in phrasing do not result in a significant change in meaning, thus complying with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. The essence of "playing performance" is captured by "Leistung," and "paid back" by "bezahlt" without losing the core message.
home runs → Hausfahrten → Homeruns  	hits → Höhen → Hits  	points → Punkte → Punkten  	team → Team → Teams  	runs → läuft → Runs  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Hausfahrten" (house trips) is a mistranslation of "home runs," which should be "Homeruns." The term "home run" is commonly used even in German-speaking contexts related to baseball.	2. "Höhen" (heights) is a mistranslation of "hits," which should be "Hits." "Hits" in baseball retains its English term in German.	3. "Punkte" is the correct translation for "points," but in this context, "Punkten" is used as seen in the reference translation because it fits better in the structure of the sentence.	4. "Team" should be "Teams" as indicated by "seine Teams" in the reference, showing the plural form was used incorrectly in the candidate.	5. "läuft" (runs, as in running) is the wrong translation for "runs" in the baseball context, where "Runs" refers to points scored in the game; it should be "Runs."
Hall of Fame → Hall of Women → Hall-of-Fame 		**Explanation:** "Hall of Women" (Frauen) is a mistranslation of "Hall of Fame". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the reference to "Hall of Women" is incorrect in the context of baseball accolades.
cannot → können → dürfte	baseball → Basballhalle → Ruhmeshalle des Baseballs		**Explanation:** "können" (can) is a mistranslation of "cannot," which changes the sentence from expressing impossibility to possibility, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "Basballhalle" is an incorrect translation of "baseball Hall of Fame." The appropriate German term "Ruhmeshalle des Baseballs" was not used, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
nicknamed → Nacken → Spitzname  	behaviour → Verhalten → Auftreten  	off → vom → außerhalb  
told → erzählte → gab zu  	taken → verboten → zu sich genommen  		**Explanation:** "erzählte" (told) is a mistranslation of "gab zu" (admitted), which changes the nature of what the superstar did, as "telling" information is less explicit than "admitting" in a context often involving wrongdoing. "verboten" (banned) should not be an action performed by the subject in this sentence, as the reference translation indicates "zu sich genommen" (consumed/taken). The candidate translation incorrectly turns "banned" into an action, instead of it being an adjective describing the steroids.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the meaning of the source sentence and accurately conveys the critical details in German. The use of "verboten" instead of "gesperrt" is contextually appropriate for "banned," and "Spiele" instead of "Partien" is a valid variation for "games." None of these choices violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as the intended meaning remains intact.
main → Hauptverdachtsfall → Hauptverdächtiger  	suspect → Hauptverdachtsfall → Hauptverdächtiger  	accused → erhalten → erhalten zu haben  	performance enhancing drugs → Leistungssteigerung → leistungsfördernde Mittel  	anti-ageing → antialternde → Anti-Aging  		**Explanation:**  	- "Hauptverdachtsfall" mistranslates both "main" and "suspect" as it implies a case rather than a person and alters the meaning. This highlights a failure in the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it misidentifies the subject.	- "erhalten" doesn't directly translate "accused," indicating a departure from attributing blame, hence a misalignment with the **Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Leistungssteigerung" (performance boost) does not appropriately translate "performance enhancing drugs," which are more specifically "leistungsfördernde Mittel." This changes the sentence's intended implication, a violation of the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "antialternde" translates "anti-ageing" but not within the correct register for a clinic name, as "Anti-Aging" is standard, showing a context error, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
ban → Verbot → Sperre  	matches → Spiele → Begegnungen  		**Explanation:** "Verbot" (ban) is a mistranslation of "Sperre" (suspension/ban in a legal or sports context). "Spiele" (games) is a mistranslation of "Begegnungen" (encounters/matches), which more closely aligns with sports terminology in German. Both follow the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, as they significantly alter the legal or sports context of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon comparing the candidate translation with the source and reference sentences, the words and their contexts in the candidate translation effectively convey the meaning of the source sentence. Although there are differences in phrasing, no specific words in the candidate translation are incorrect based on the criteria given. "Die Liga hätte" and "mir im Jahr 2014 einen Gefallen tun können" effectively translates "The league might even have done me a favour in 2014". Additionally, "ohne Unterbrechung gespielt" is a valid translation of "without a break". Therefore, following the rules, no significant single-word translation errors are present.
final → letzten → Abschieds  	bang → Bankrott → geräuschlos  		**Explanation:** "letzten" (last) is correct in general context, but "final" here refers specifically to a type of concluding days, appropriately translated to "Abschieds" (farewell). "Bankrott" (bankruptcy) is a mistranslation of "bang", as it changes the metaphorical sense and intended meaning significantly. "bang" in this context refers to an eventful or noisy conclusion, which "geräuschlos" (quietly) correctly negates.
baseball legends → Basellends → Baseball-Legenden  	stage → Phase → Bühne  		**Explanation:** "Basellends" appears to be a misspelling or incorrect translation of "baseball legends", which is correctly translated as "Baseball-Legenden". "Phase" (phase) is a mistranslation of "stage", which should be "Bühne" (stage) to fit the metaphorical context of the sentence. This significantly alters the intended meaning.
job → Arbeit → Job		**Explanation:** The word "Arbeit" (work) is a mistranslation of "job". Although "Arbeit" might sometimes convey a similar concept, in this context, it more appropriately signifies "work" in general rather than a specific "job", as intended in the source. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because it does not capture the same specificity.
job → Aufgabe → Job  	stated → sagte → ätzte  	coach → buss → Coach  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Aufgabe" (task) is a mistranslation of "job". While similar, in this context, "Job" better reflects the professional role. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	2. "sagte" (said) is a less precise translation for "stated", compared to "ätzte" (quipped/asserted), which captures the more formal or nuanced tone. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	3. "buss" is an incorrect translation for "coach". The correct translation here should be "Coach". This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "buss" is not relevant.
Cameron → unter → mit  	star → Sterne → Popstar  	axis → Achse → Schauspielerin  	Yankees' → Yankees erzürnenden → Yankee-Erzrivalen  	red → Rote → Red  		**Explanation:**		1. **Cameron → unter → mit:** The candidate translation incorrectly uses "unter" (under), which does not fit the context of being married "with" someone, as in "mit Cameron Diaz".		2. **star → Sterne → Popstar:** "Sterne" (stars) in the candidate translation is a mistranslation for "pop star", where "Popstar" is more appropriate.		3. **axis → Achse → Schauspielerin:** "Achse" (axis) is a mistranslation for "actress", where "Schauspielerin" is the correct word.		4. **Yankees' → Yankees erzürnenden → Yankee-Erzrivalen:** The candidate translation uses "erzürnenden," which modifies the noun "Konkurrenten" inaccurately to mean "angry rivals" instead of the intended "arch rivals". The reference "Erzrivalen" better captures this meaning.		5. **red → Rote → Red:** "Rote" is the literal translation of "red", but in this context, it's a part of a proper noun "Red Sox", and should be maintained as "Red".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation does not contain any significant single-word translation errors when compared to the source and reference sentences. It follows the overall meaning and context accurately.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source sentence, despite minor stylistic differences with the reference translation, such as "Olympia 2016" versus "2016 Olympische Spiele." The focus here is on significant changes in meaning, not stylistic variations.
busted → Bust → Erwischt  	tested → getesteten → positiven  	sample → Stichprobenprobe → Dopingprobe  	weightlifter → Gewichtsteller → Gewichtheber  	compete → konkurrieren → starten  		**Explanation:**		- "Bust" (bust) is not equivalent to "Busted" (caught), which is more accurately translated in the reference as "Erwischt". This fits under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "getesteten" (tested) does not directly equate with "positiven" (positive); the context of the doping result is crucial here.	- "Stichprobenprobe" (sample sample or sample of samples) is redundant and incorrect for "sample," which "Dopingprobe" (doping test/sample) captures more accurately; under the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, the redundant term is reduced correctly.	- "Gewichtsteller" (weight teller) misconstrues "weightlifter," correctly given as "Gewichtheber" in the reference.	- "konkurrieren" (to compete) does not accurately translate the context of "starten" (to start/enter an event) in the sporting context described.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although there's a slight difference in tense between "wurden" (were) and "werden" (are), this does not significantly alter the meaning regarding the overshadowing by the doping cases, especially considering the context. Therefore, there are no significant single-word translation errors that need to be reported.
banned → verbotener → erwischte		**Explanation:** "verbotener" (forbidden) is a mistranslation of "now-banned", which in this context refers to "caught". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "verbieten" implies the athlete was forbidden, while "erwischen" captures the meaning of being caught, possibly for doping.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the source sentence, with no significant meaning-altering mistranslations when compared to the reference translation. The variations in phrasing and word choice ("Wettbewerbstag" vs. "Wettkampftag", "angekündigt" vs. "bekannt geworden") are acceptable and do not change the core meaning, thus following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
tested → testet → getestet  	hurdler → Hüller → Hindernisläuferin  	excluded → ausgeschlossen → ausgeschlossen wurden  	meter → Meter → Meter  	athletics → Sportwettbewerbs → Leichtathletik-Wettbewerbe  		**Explanation:**  	- "testet" (tests) should be "getestet" (tested) to match the past tense in the reference translation.	- "Hüller" (no meaning or incorrect rendering) is incorrect for "hurdler" and should be "Hindernisläuferin", which is correct.	- "ausgeschlossen" (excluded) misses the ending to convey the passive "were excluded," which is "ausgeschlossen wurden" in context.	- "Meter" is correct but seemed to cause confusion when paired with "300" instead of "3000." However, "Meter" itself remains accurate.	- "Sportwettbewerbs" (sport competition) is too vague and incorrect for "athletics competition," which should specifically be "Leichtathletik-Wettbewerbe."
presence → Vorhandensein → nachgewiesen  	hydrochlorothiazide → Chlorothiazid → Hydrochlorothiazid  		**Explanation:** "Vorhandensein" (presence) is a mistranslation of "nachgewiesen" (detected) in the context of substances like drugs, which significantly changes the sentence's implication about the action taken. Additionally, "Chlorothiazid" is an incorrect simplification of "Hydrochlorothiazid", where the specific chemical name is essential to accurately convey the substance in question. These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "verboten" for "banned", which is a direct and common translation for being prohibited. The slight variation in phrasing ("vor Ort" vs. "Ortszeit" and "verboten worden sei" vs. "ihren Ausschluss") does not significantly change the meaning of the sentence or deviate from acceptable German expressions for the source statement. Therefore, this adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, resulting in no translation errors requiring reporting.
1. place → Fall → Finale		**Explanation:** "Fall" is a mistranslation of "final". In this context, "Finale" is the correct translation for the phrase "100m Butterfly final".		2. missing → fehlte → verpasste		**Explanation:** "fehlte" (was missing) does not convey the intended meaning of "missing out on a medal" due to a narrow margin. "verpasste" (missed) is more contextually accurate.
1. Freestyle → Freisyle → Freistil  	2. heats → Hitzen → Vorläufen  		**Explanation:** "Freisyle" is a misspelling of "Freestyle," which should be "Freistil" in German. This violates the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by having an incorrect word form. "Hitzen" is an incorrect translation of "heats," which should be "Vorlaufen" in the sports context, affecting the intended meaning.
IOC → Internationale → Internationalen  	hearing → Anhörung → Öffnung  	her → seiner → ihrer  		**Explanation:**		1. "Internationale" (International) is in the nominative case in the candidate translation, while "Internationalen" in the reference is correctly in the dative case after "beim," indicating a grammatical mistranslation as the preposition requires dative.		2. "Anhörung" (hearing) is a mistranslation in context as the reference indicates "Öffnung" (opening) was incorrectly prefixed by Ihnen "beantragt" ("beantragte zur Anhörung" vs. "beantragt zur Eröffnung").		3. "seiner" (his) should be "ihrer" (her), given "Chen" is assumed female here, which affects pronoun agreement and indicates a significant contextual error.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and matches the intent of the reference. Although there are slight variations in wording (e.g., "bittet darum" vs. "verlangt"), both express the request for cooperation, and the overall meaning remains intact. Hence, there are no significant single-word mistranslations affecting the sentence's meaning.
sportspeople → Sportler → Sportler mit positiven Fällen  		**Explanation:** "Sportler" is a mistranslation of "sportspeople who test positive", as it lacks the implication of having tested positive for something, which is crucial for the sentence's meaning. The reference translation correctly specifies "Sportler mit positiven Fällen" (sportspeople with positive cases), indicating those who tested positive. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as the mistranslation changes which sportspeople are being referred to.
33-year-old → 33-jährige → 33-Jährige		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "33-jähriger" (masculine), while the source and reference sentences indicate this should refer to a female, as evidenced by "33-Jährige" (feminine). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the meaning and context of the source sentence effectively. Variations in phrasing, such as "zu bulgarischem Fernsehkanal" instead of "dem bulgarischen TV-Sender," do not significantly alter the sentence's meaning in context. Therefore, according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** instruction, no concerning translation mistakes are identified.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** Both "Nahrungsergänzungen" (food supplements) and "Nahrungsergänzungsmittel" (also food supplements) are acceptable translations within the context, as they convey the same meaning. "Athlete" translated as either "Athletin" or "Leichtathletin" (track-and-field athlete) does not constitute a significant enough alteration in meaning to be considered a mistranslation. The candidate translation accurately conveys the original meaning, consistent with the guidelines for handling ambiguity and focusing on meaningful errors.
banned → verboten → verbotenen   	substance → Stoff → Substanz  	chemical → Chemie → Mittel  	EPO → EPA → EPO  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Stoff" (material) is a less precise translation of "substance" compared to "Substanz", as per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.  	2. "Chemie" (chemistry) is a mistranslation of "chemical", which is used here in the sense of a specific substance rather than the abstract scientific field. "Mittel" (agent) is more appropriate in this context.  	3. "EPA" is a mistranslation of "EPO", a critical error as it refers to a completely different entity, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
precaution → vorsorglich → vorläufig  	tested → getestet → positiv ausgefallen
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively conveys the meaning of the source sentence. "Der bulgarische Premierminister" and "Bulgariens Ministerpräsident" both accurately refer to Bulgaria's Prime Minister. "Sportler" and "Athletin" both mean athlete, with "Athletin" specifically referring to a female athlete, which could be considered a slight difference but does not significantly change the sentence's meaning. Therefore, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no significant translation errors are detected.
sportspeople → Sportler → die Sportler  	conclusions → Schlussfolgerungen → Schlüsse  	observation → beobachtet → unter Beobachtung  	banned → verboten → ausgeschlossen worden  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Sportler" lacks the article "die" (the) which is present in the reference translation and changes the meaning slightly, as "die Sportler" references a specific group of sportspeople.	2. "Schlussfolgerungen" (conclusions) differs from "Schlüsse" (conclusions), where the reference uses a more concise form that fits the context better, indicating possibly the immediate conclusions drawn in a specific situation.	3. "beobachtet" (observed) incorrectly replaces "unter Beobachtung" (under observation). The phrase "unter Beobachtung" is more idiomatic and contextually correct.	4. "verboten" (forbidden) changes the context of "banned", where "ausgeschlossen worden" (excluded) aligns correctly with being banned from participation rather than engaging in an activity.
weightlifters → Gewichtshubschrauber → Gewichtheber  		**Explanation:** "Gewichtshubschrauber" (helicopters) is a mistranslation of "weightlifters". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, because helicopters cannot participate in competitions, and contextually it does not fit the sentence.
Zielinski → Zinski → Zielinski  	anabolic steroid → Steroide → Steroid  	Nandrolone → Nandrolone → Nandrolon  	tested → durchgeführt → getestet  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Zielinski" was mistranslated as "Zinski", which is a clear misspelling and changes the meaning.  	2. "Steroide" (steroids) is a mistranslation of "steroid" as it suggests multiple substances rather than one. The reference uses "Steroid", which is singular and matches the source.  	3. "Nandrolone" should be "Nandrolon" in German. The reference translation confirms that "Nandrolon" is correct.  	4. "durchgeführt" (conducted) is a mistranslation of "tested". The word should be "getestet" to match the reference. Using "durchgeführt" changes the meaning by suggesting the subject was conducting the test rather than being the one tested.
deny → leugnen → bestreiten  	neither → es → beide  	compete → konkurrieren → starten  		**Explanation:** "leugnen" (deny) is a less fitting translation compared to "bestreiten", particularly since "Einnahme" (taking/consumption) is not included in the candidate, impacting the contextual accuracy. "es" (it) is a mistranslation of "neither" in this context, as it fails to convey the meaning that neither individual was allowed. "konkurrieren" (compete) does not fit as specifically as "starten" when referring to participating in a weight category. This fulfills the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation correctly translates "ahead of the athletes' start" as "Vor dem Beginn der Athleten". Though "Beginn" and "Start" are different words, both mean "start" in this context and do not change the meaning. The word "Ruf" (reputation) alternates with "Reputation" from the reference translation, yet it remains accurate in this context. Hence, while there are slight variations, the candidate sentence maintains the intended meaning without significant errors, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
banned → verboten → den Start untersagt  	World Federation IAAF → Weltföderation IAF → Weltverband IAAF  	running → regierende → Läufernation  		**Explanation:** "verboten" (prohibited) does not accurately capture the context-specific action of "banning" from competing, which "den Start untersagt" directly translates to, per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Weltföderation IAF" (World Federation IAF) is a mistranslation of "World Federation IAAF", where IAF is incorrect, contrasting with the universally accepted "Weltverband IAAF". Lastly, "regierende" (governing) nation is an incorrect interpretation of "running nation", where the intended meaning is specific to athletics, for which "Läufernation" (running nation) is appropriate, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules.
earlier → frühere → früheren  	offence → Straftat → Vergehen  		**Explanation:** "frühere" is a mistranslation of "earlier" because it doesn't correctly match the grammatical case or context in the sentence ("früheren" fits better based on the reference translation). "Straftat" (crime) is not the best translation for "offence" in this context, where "Vergehen" (misdemeanor) is more appropriate, especially given the context of disputes in a sports setting. Both instances impact the accuracy and context, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
Olympic winner → olympische Gewinnerin → Olympiasieger  		**Explanation:** "olympische Gewinnerin" (Olympic female winner) is a mistranslation of "Olympic winner", as Sun Yang is male. The correct term should align with "Olympiasieger" (Olympic winner), which is gender-neutral or male-specific, preserving the intended meaning from the source.
pee → Frieden → pinkelt  	purple → ples → lila  		**Explanation:** "Frieden" (peace) is a mistranslation of "pee" (urine). This significantly alters the meaning of the sentence and violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "ples" is not a valid or recognized German word, making it a mistranslation of "purple". This alters the intended meaning when compared to the reference "lila".
Freestyle → Freestyle → Freistil  	throw up → antreten → übergeben  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Freestyle" remains untranslated in the candidate sentence, while the reference appropriately translates it to "Freistil". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "antreten" (compete or enlist) is a mistranslation of "throw up", which means "to vomit" in this context. This significantly changes the meaning of the statement, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While there are differences in word choice between the candidate and reference translations, none of them significantly alter the meaning or context of the sentence. Therefore, per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no translation errors are reported.
no respect → keine Achtung → keinen Respekt  	drug cheats → Drogenbetrügern → Doping-Betrüger  		**Explanation:** "keine Achtung" (no regard) is a mistranslation of "no respect" ("keinen Respekt"), changing the nuance of the sentence. "Drogenbetrügern" (drug fraudsters) is a mistranslation of "drug cheats" ("Doping-Betrüger"), where "Doping" specifically refers to performance-enhancing drug use, whereas "Drogen" is more general. This adheres to the **Identify Mistranslations** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
tested → getestet → getestet worden  	sit → sitzen → absitzen  	ban → Verbot → Sperre  		**Explanation:** "getestet" needs to be "getestet worden" because the reference translation requires a passive past-perfect construction for accuracy, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The translation of "sit out" as "sitzen" omits the duration implication of serving a ban, which is "absitzen," correcting according to **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**. "Verbot" is not the accurate term for a sports context where "Sperre" (suspension) is more suitable, adhering to the same rule.
extort → erpressen → erpressen  	ransom money → Erpressungsgelder → Lösegeld  		**Explanation:** In the candidate sentence, "erpressen" correctly translates "extort," so there is no error in this part. However, the candidate translation uses "Erpressungsgelder" instead of "Lösegeld" for "ransom money." While "Erpressungsgelder" can mean "extortion money," "Lösegeld" is the correct term for "ransom money" in this context, and it captures the intended meaning more accurately. Therefore, based on the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, only "ransom money" needs to be addressed as a translation error.
programmers → Programme → Programmierer  	malware → erpresserischen → Erpressungs-Malware  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning and context of the source sentence. The variations in wording do not significantly alter the intended meaning and remain contextually appropriate.
ransomware → Ranosware → Ransomware		**Explanation:** "Ranosware" is a spelling error of "Ransomware". This follows the **Identify Mistranslations** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules by pointing out the incorrect spelling, which significantly alters the meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation aligns well with the reference translation and captures the key aspects of the source sentence. Both versions refer to the victims paying the ransom willingly to regain use of their systems and data affected by the attack. The differences between "Lösegeld" and "Lösegelder" or "verlangte" and "geforderten" are minor and do not significantly change the meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation preserves the meaning of the original English sentence well, conveying the key concepts and context. While there are variations in wording, they do not significantly alter the intended message, thus adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Both the candidate and reference use appropriate terms to capture the essence of the original sentence.
ransom → Löschgeld → Lösegeld  		**Explanation:** "Löschgeld" refers to a fee or price for deletion, which is incorrect here as it should refer to "ransom." The correct term is "Lösegeld," which aligns with the reference translation and the intended meaning of a monetary demand for release.
seeing → sehen → beobachten	quickly → (missing) → schnell	"Die Welt" newspaper → der Zeitung "Die Welt" → der "Welt"		**Explanation:**	- "sehen" (seeing) is a mistranslation of "beobachten" (observe), which is more contextually accurate in terms of monitoring or noticing something over time.	- The word "quickly" is missing in the candidate sentence, which means an essential part of the rapid development aspect is lost, differing from "schnell" in the reference.	- "der Zeitung 'Die Welt'" is a redundant construction; in more typical phrasing, "der 'Welt'" is used as in the reference.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively communicates the intent of the source sentence. The differences in wording, such as "konzentrierten sich... auf" (focused on) and "darauf ausgelegt... zu" (designed to), do not significantly alter the meaning, allowing for acceptable variation. Therefore, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, no errors are reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Dann entdeckten Täter Erpressungssoftware" is a correct translation of the source sentence. The differences between the candidate and reference translations are in the presence of "die" (the) and the phrase "für sich" (for themselves), which do not significantly alter the essential meaning of the sentence regarding the discovery of extortion software by the perpetrators. Thus, there are no significant single-word translation errors, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Each significant term in the candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. "Private users" is correctly translated to "die privaten Nutzer", "target" to "Ziel", and "corporate attacks" to "Unternehmensangriffe". While "shift" is translated as "Verlagerung" and "switch" as "Wechsel", this difference is acceptable and does not alter the sentence's meaning significantly enough to be considered a mistranslation. The temporal expressions and adjectives fit well within the context, maintaining the intended urgency of the change. Thus, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, no single-word translation errors are present.
files → Akten → Dateien  	edited → ausgelegt → veränderten  	Word → Wort → Word  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Akten" (files) is translated as "files" in some contexts, but in this technical context related to computer data, "Dateien" is the correct term. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "ausgelegt" (laid out) is an incorrect translation of "edited". The correct term "veränderten" (changed/edited) maintains the original meaning, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	3. "Wort" (word) is a literal translation of "Word" (the software application) and changes the intended meaning. "Word" as a proper noun should be maintained, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
ransomware → Ranoware → Ransomware  	files → Akten → Dateien  	originals → Ursprünge → Originale  		**Explanation:** "Ransomware" should be "Ransomware" not "Ranoware" as per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "files" translated to "Akten" deviates from "Dateien", as "Akten" generally refers to "records" or "documents", which alters the specific context, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Lastly, "originals" is mistranslated as "Ursprünge", meaning "origins", which changes the intended meaning entirely, hence identified under the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
extortioner's → Urhebers → Erpresser		**Explanation:** "Urhebers" (author) is a mistranslation of "extortioner's". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the demands associated with extortion are specifically tied to an "Erpresser" (extortioner), not an "Urheber" (author). This significantly changes the meaning in the context of demands being made under pressure or coercion.
Bitcoins → Bitmünzen → Bitcoin  	decryption → Deckungskodex → Endschlüsselungs-Code  	files → Akten → Dateien  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Bitmünzen" is a mistranslation of "Bitcoins." The term "Bitcoin" is generally used as is, whether in English or German, without translation. This alteration significantly affects the sentence's meaning as "Bitmünzen" could potentially confuse the reader.  	2. "Deckungskodex" is a mistranslation of "decryption." The correct translation of "decryption code" in the reference is "Endschlüsselungs-Code," which is used specifically for the context of decoding or decrypting files.  	3. "Akten" is a mistranslation of "files." In this context, "Akten" suggests more formal or official documents, whereas "Dateien" accurately covers the broader and more general scope of "files." These errors are all significant and change the original sentence's meaning or comprehension, thus they are reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the same meaning as the source and reference sentences. While there are some differences in word choice and structure, none of them significantly alter the meaning or introduce any mistranslations. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as the translation appropriately conveys the original sentence's intent.
As a result → Die Folge → Dementsprechend  	ransomware → Ranomastoffes → Ransomware  		**Explanation:** "Die Folge ist" translates to "the result is", whereas the reference uses "Dementsprechend", meaning "accordingly", which aligns more closely with "As a result". "Ranomastoffes" is not a correct translation of "ransomware", instead, "Ransomware" should be used. This addresses the **Identify Mistranslations** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules because the mistranslation of "ransomware" is significant, altering the specific threat described.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Umsatzrückgang" for "fall in turnover", which conveys the weakening of revenue similar to "Umsatzverluste" (revenue losses). The phrase "den Handel vollständig einstellen" (cease trading entirely) matches the impact depicted by "die Geschäftstätigkeit komplett unterbrechen" (completely halt business activities). In the context of people's lives being at risk, both "Menschenleben gefährdet" and "Menschen in Lebensgefahr" highlight the severity of the situation. Thus, there are no significant mistranslations altering the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the reference translation, with acceptable variations. "mehrere Krankenhäuser" (several hospitals) aligns with "mehrfach Krankenhäuser" (multiple hospitals), "Anschlägen" (attacks) and "Attacken" (attacks) are interchangeable, and other wordings maintain the intended meaning. Thus, no significant translation errors are present, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence and aligns well with the reference translation. Although there are some differences in phrasing, the essential message and context are preserved, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Thus, no significant single-word translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:**  	- The candidate translation "Aber 80 bis 90% der Unternehmen, die zahlen, erhalten ihre Akten zurück" maintains the overall meaning of the source sentence.  	- "Aber" and "Doch" can both be translated to "But," hence are acceptable variations.  	- "Unternehmen" and "Firmen" both mean "companies," so there's no change in meaning.  	- "80 bis 90%" and "80 bis 90 Prozent" represent the same percentage, thus are interchangeable.  	- "Erhalten" and "bekommen" both mean "get" or "receive," maintaining the intended information.  	- "Akten" (files) and "Daten" (data) are interchangeable in the context of companies getting information back.  		Given the above analysis, no significant single-word translation error alters the intended meaning in context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the meaning of the source sentence accurately, with each word fitting contextually in the German target language. The choice of words like "festgefahrene Operationen" for "operations coming to a standstill" and "Forderungen der Täter" for "the perpetrators' demands" are acceptable translations and do not significantly change the intended meaning of the sentence. Thus, there are no significant single-word mistranslations to report according to the provided instructions.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essence of the source sentence. The translation avoids any significant mistranslations when compared to the source and reference sentences, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
study → Studie → Untersuchung  	researchers → Sicherheitsforscher → Forscher  	user interfaces → Benutzerinterface → Nutzeroberflächen  	contact → Kontakt → Umgang  	extortioners → Erpressern → Erpresser  	customer service system → Kundendienstleistungssystem → Kundenservice  	money → Geld → Einnahmen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Studie" is translated as "Untersuchung" in the reference, which is a more accurate term for a "study" in the context of academic research.	- "Sicherheitsforscher" (security researchers) can be simplified to "Forscher" (researchers), which is a more general term used in the reference.	- "Benutzerinterface" is a mistranslation of "user interfaces", which should be "Nutzeroberflächen" to align with standard German terminology.	- "Kontakt" should be "Umgang," as the context suggests dealing with extortioners rather than mere contact.	- "Erpressern" should align with the singular "Erpresser" in the reference.	- "Kundendienstleistungssystem" is incorrect for "customer service system," which is better translated as "Kundenservice."	- "Geld" is translated to "Einnahmen" in the reference, which implies revenue, thus changing the financial context slightly.
Bitcoin → BitmMünzen → Bitcoin  	decrypt → verschlüsselte → entschlüsseln  		**Explanation:** "BitmMünzen" is a mistranslation of "Bitcoin" as there is no such word in German, and the correct term is "Bitcoin." "verschlüsselte" (encrypted) is the opposite of "entschlüsseln" (decrypt), thereby changing the intended action in the sentence. These errors significantly alter the intended meaning, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
targeted → bestimmt → nach Zahlungen  	bargain → feilschen → verhandeln  	numbers → Zahlen → Summen  	files → Akten → Daten  	decrypted → entstellen → unverschlüsselt  		**Explanation:** "bestimmt" (determined) is not the correct translation for "targeted", which in the reference implies demands for payment ("nach Zahlungen"). "Feilschen" is closer to "haggling" and not as formal as "verhandeln" (negotiate/bargain), which is more appropriate here. "Zahlen" (numbers) is a mistranslation of "sums" in the given context, which should be "Summen". "Akten" (files, in a physical sense) is a less suitable translation for "Daten" (data/files, in a digital context). Lastly, "entstellen" (to disfigure) is incorrect for "decrypted", where "unverschlüsselt" (decrypted) is correct in the reference context. Each of these mistranslations significantly affects the accuracy and context of the original meaning.
ransomware → Ranoskareerpressungen → Ransomware-Erpressung  	security → den → Sicherheit  	antivirus → Antikir → Antivirus  	profits → Profite → Gewinne  		**Explanation:**  	1. **ransomware → Ranoskareerpressungen → Ransomware-Erpressung:** "Ranoskareerpressungen" is a misspelling and incorrect rendering of "ransomware extortion", which should be "Ransomware-Erpressung."	2. **security → den → Sicherheit:** The candidate uses "den," which appears to be a grammatical error possibly attempting to refer to "security," which should be "Sicherheit."	3. **antivirus → Antikir → Antivirus:** "Antikir" is a clear mistranslation of "antivirus," and it should be "Antivirus."	4. **profits → Profite → Gewinne:** While "Profite" can be translated as "profits," in this context "Gewinne" is more appropriate, aligning better with "risk-free profits" as described in the source. 		The mistranslations identified significantly affect the meaning, as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence. Although the structure differs from the reference translation, the key elements ("more likely," "three or four people," and "involved") are correctly represented, respecting the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
malware → Malware → Schadsoftware  	set → Reihe → Baukasten  		**Explanation:** "Malware" in the candidate retains the English term, while "Schadsoftware" is used in the reference to reflect the German equivalent, indicating a need for translation for contextual accuracy. "Reihe" (series) in the candidate does not convey the idea of a "Baukasten" (toolkit or set of building blocks) as in the reference, which is crucial for understanding the composition of software components.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation correctly conveys the meaning of the source sentence, with all key elements such as "Malware kits", "including the malware itself", "advice", "additional tools", "one-off fixed fee", and "1000 to 10,000 dollars" accurately translated and fitting the context. The differences observed are stylistic or structural variations and do not significantly alter the intended meaning, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
kits → Kitte → Lieferumfang  	tool → Anpassungsinstrument → Anpassungstool  	branding → Marken → Branding  		**Explanation:**  	- "Kitte" is a mistranslation of "kits". The reference uses "Lieferumfang" to convey the set of components included, which is more accurate.	- "Anpassungsinstrument" is a mistranslation of "adapter tool". The reference uses "Anpassungstool" which is a more contextually correct translation focusing specifically on the adapter.	- "Marken" is a mistranslation of "branding". The correct translation should align with the reference, which uses "Branding", reflecting the concept more accurately in this business context.
additional → zusätzliche → weitere  	prepared → vorbereitete → eingekaufte  		**Explanation:** "zusätzliche" (additional) is a literal translation of "additional," but "weitere" (further) is more contextually appropriate in this sentence. "vorbereitete" (prepared) is a mistranslation of "prepared" in this context, where "eingekaufte" (purchased) was intended. Thus, these errors were identified by the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation precisely matches the reference translation and accurately represents the source sentence. There are no single-word errors that significantly alter the meaning, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
log into → setzen sich ein → loggt sich ein  	set → Decke → Set  	as many → so viele → möglichst vielen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "setzen sich ein" (occupy oneself) is a mistranslation of "log into," which should be "loggt sich ein" in the context of accessing a forum.	2. "Decke" (ceiling/cover) is a mistranslation of "set," which should be "Set," indicating the product being bought.	3. "so viele" (so many) is not contextually accurate for "as many as possible," which should be "möglichst vielen" to convey the extent properly.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Die Bezahlung erfolgt für jeden infizierten Computer" effectively conveys the same meaning as the reference translation "Die Bezahlung erfolgt pro infiziertem Rechner." The word "Rechner" (computer) in the reference can be translated as "Computer" in the candidate without a significant change in meaning, and both "jeden" and "pro" with their respective forms are acceptable in context, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Normally → betrachten → beauftragen		task → Vertrieb → beauftragen		distribution → Vertrieb → Verbreitung		**Explanation:** 	1. "betrachten" (consider/view) is a mistranslation of "task". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it changes the intended action of what criminals are doing with spammers.	2. "Vertrieb" (sales/distribution) is a mistranslation of "task" in this context. While "Vertrieb" might imply distribution, it is not being actively tasked to someone, which is what "beauftragen" conveys.	3. "Vertrieb" (sales/distribution) is also a mistranslation of "distribution", where the more accurate word would be "Verbreitung" (propagation/spreading), in the context provided.
ransomware → Ranosware → Ransomware		**Explanation:** "Ranosware" is a typographical error of "Ransomware," which is crucial to the meaning as it refers to a specific type of cyber threat. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the intended meaning and correct recognition of the threat.
survey → Umfrage → Umfrage	Maywarebytes → Mayrebyts → Malwarebytes	file → Akten → Datei	ransomware → Ransomare → Ransomware		**Explanation:**		- "Mayrebyts" is a misspelling and mistranslation of "Maywarebytes". The correct translation should be "Malwarebytes", following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because such errors could affect brand identity.	- "Akten" (files) is a translation error for "file" as it doesn't convey the specific context of IT terminology, where "Datei" is more appropriate. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Ransomare" is a misspelling and mistranslation of "ransomware". This is a significant error as it could change the understanding of the security context discussed. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule by addressing the primary error directly related to the meaning of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Die Täter erproben daher bereits neue Strategien" captures the meaning of the original English sentence accurately. The word "erproben" (try out) is a reasonable translation for "trying out," and "daher" (as a result) captures the causal meaning of "as a result." Although "dementsprechend" (correspondingly) in the reference is another option, the candidate maintains the sentence's intended meaning, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. The rest of the sentence aligns well with the source, so no significant translation errors are present.
encrypting → Auflistung → Verschlüsselung  	files → Dateien → Daten		**Explanation:** 	1. "Auflistung" (listing) is a mistranslation of "encrypting". The correct term in the context of cyber threats is "Verschlüsselung" (encryption), and it follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as listing files does not align with the concept of increasing a threat through encryption.	2. "Dateien" (files) is used instead of "Daten" (data), which in the context of cybersecurity and file handling, shifts the intended meaning slightly but significantly enough as "data" includes a broader category essential in the cyber context, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source sentence. Although the wording differs slightly from the reference translation, the essential meaning and context are preserved. As per the rules, variations that do not impact the meaning do not count as errors.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation successfully conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The differences between the candidate and reference, such as "können" vs "könnten" and "konzentrieren" vs "aufs Korn nehmen", are acceptable variations that do not result in a significant change in meaning. Thus, these follow the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule and do not constitute translation errors.
Defcon → Decco → Defcon		**Explanation:** "Decco" is a mistranslation of "Defcon". This is a significant error as it incorrectly names the hacker conference, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, where the name "Defcon" should be preserved accurately.
blocked → blockierte → blockierten  	returned → zurückkehrt → Freischaltung  		**Explanation:** "blockierte" is a mistranslation of "blocked", which should align with "blockierten". "zurückkehrt" (returns) is a mistranslation of the contextually intended meaning related to having the heating "turned back on", which is better represented by "Freischaltung" (activation/releasing).
hackers → Hacker → Täter  	switch off → abschalten → blockieren  	ransomware → Stromware → Ransomware  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Hacker" is translated correctly as "Hackers" in German, but the reference uses "Täter" which aligns more with the broader "perpetrators." However, since "Hacker" is a specific subset of "Täter" in this context, it's marked here because of the subtle difference indicated in the reference.	   	2. "switch off" is translated as "abschalten", whereas the reference uses "blockieren". While both can imply stopping operations, "blockieren" more accurately conveys the idea of obstructing or making unavailable rather than merely turning off, aligning better with the context of ransomware activity.		3. "ransomware" is translated as "Stromware", which is incorrect and refers to "electricity ware" instead of maintaining the term "Ransomware", which is a specific type of malware and should not be altered.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While the candidate translation "Für jede Situation" omits the specific aspect of "something" and provides a slightly different nuance compared to the reference, it can be considered a valid variation. The core meaning of having a solution or option for "every situation" aligns with the source sentence's intent, hence no significant single-word mistranslations are identified.
practical → praktisch → flexibel	perfect → perfekt → alltagstauglich		**Explanation:** "praktisch" (practical) is a mistranslation of "flexibel" (flexible), which significantly changes the intended meaning as "flexible" more accurately describes adaptability for various conditions. "perfekt" (perfect) does not accurately convey the sense of "alltagstauglich" (suitable for everyday use), which is crucial for understanding the utility in daily life context. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** guidelines.
HR-V → HR-Flügel → HR-V  	coupé → Copé → Coupé  	minivan → Minivan → Minivans  		**Explanation:** "HR-Flügel" is a mistranslation of "HR-V"; "Flügel" (wing) is incorrect and changes the model name. "Copé" is a misspelling of the German "Coupé," affecting comprehension. "Minivan" should be pluralized as "Minivans," as per standard German grammar, maintaining the consistency in translation with the reference.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** In the provided sentences, the candidate translation does not present any significant single-word errors compared to the reference translation. The terms used convey the intended meaning correctly, maintaining contextual accuracy and not altering the overall intent of the source sentence. Variability in phrases like "es scheint ein bisschen zu viel zu sein" versus "klingt ziemlich überladen" reflects acceptable variation and does not constitute a noticeable mistranslation.
HR-V → LKW-Maut → HR-V  	tall → groß → hohe  	front → Vor- → ersten Reihe  	back → hinten → Fond  	room → Pause → Platz  		**Explanation:**  	- "LKW-Maut" (truck toll) is a mistranslation of "HR-V", which is the model name intended in the context.	- "groß" (big/tall) does not accurately translate "tall" in the given context where "hohe" (high) is more appropriate.	- "Vor-" (an unfinished translation suggesting a prefix) is incorrect for "front", where "ersten Reihe" (first row) correctly conveys the intended part of the car.	- "hinten" (back) is acceptable in some contexts but does not fit here as accurately as "Fond" (rear section/compartment).	- "Pause" (break) is a mistranslation of "room", which does not convey the intended meaning of "space" or "room" in the vehicle. "Platz" (space) is the correct word in this context.
materials → Materialien → Materialien des Innenraums  	crafted → gezeichnet → verarbeitet  	dashboard → Oberfläche → Cockpit-Oberseite  	side → Seite → da etwas  		**Explanation:**  	- "Materials" is translated as "Materialien". While "Materialien" is correct, the reference specifies the context "des Innenraums", clarifying that the materials are for the interior. This was flagged for specifying contextual precision, but it may be interpretable without these qualifiers.	- "Crafted" as "gezeichnet" is incorrect. "Gezeichnet" means drawn, whereas "verarbeitet" means crafted, fitting the context of material quality.	- "Dashboard" is translated as "Oberfläche", which is vague. The reference specifies "Cockpit-Oberseite", clarifying the specific surface on the dashboard.	- "Side" is translated as "Seite" which is incorrect in this context. The phrase "fällt da etwas ab" indicates a drop in quality, and is more than just a literal translation of "side".
HR-V → LKW-Fahrzeuge → HR-V		**Explanation:** "LKW-Fahrzeuge" (truck vehicles) is a mistranslation of "HR-V". The HR-V is a specific model name and should not be generalized as "LKW-Fahrzeuge." This error significantly changes the meaning of the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
453 l → 453 l oben → 453 l bei hochgestellten Rückenlehnen	1026 l → 1026 l unten → 1026 l bei umgeklappten Rückenlehnen  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation lacks the specific context of "453 l with the seats up" and "1026 l with the seats down", which is crucial to convey the accurate meaning regarding the boot capacity in different seat configurations. The candidate uses "oben" (upstairs) and "unten" (downstairs), which incorrectly implies spatial positions rather than seat configurations, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
seats → Sitze → Sitzflächen  	flipped → aufgefüllt → hochklappen  	ceiling → Obergrenze → Decken  		**Explanation:**  	- "Sitze" (seats) is not entirely incorrect but "Sitzflächen" (seat surfaces) more specifically conveys the intended part of the seats being involved in the action, aligning with the reference.	- "aufgefüllt" (filled up) does not match the action described by "flipped" as "hochklappen" (flip up).	- "Obergrenze" (upper limit) should be "Decken" (ceiling) to accurately refer to the vertical space measured from floor to ceiling, which changes the meaning of the measurement.
boot → Kabine → Kofferraum		**Explanation:** The word "Kabine" (cabin) is a mistranslation of "boot" (which refers to the trunk or luggage compartment of a car in British English). In this context, "Kofferraum" is the correct translation. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "cabin" and "boot" refer to different parts of a vehicle.
1. torque → Torheit → Drehmoment	2. speeds → Geschwindigkeiten → Drehzahlbereichen	3. HR-V → HR-Fahrzeuge → HR-V		**Explanation:**  	- "Torheit" (foolishness) is a mistranslation of "torque," which should be "Drehmoment" in the automotive context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Geschwindigkeiten" (speeds) does not capture the nuanced automotive concept of "Drehzahlbereichen" (range of engine speeds). This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "HR-Fahrzeuge" (HR vehicles) generalizes the specific model "HR-V," violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it changes the specific reference.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although there are differences in wording and gender ("sie" vs. "er"), the meaning is effectively preserved. "Ruhiger" (calmer) and "leiser" (quieter) can convey the same intent in this context, and "erledigen" (accomplish) and "verrichten" (perform) also sufficiently represent "do its work." Therefore, no significant mistranslation is detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the source sentence's meaning and is consistent with the reference translation. The words "tägliche" (everyday), "Verbrauch" (consumption), and "erfreulich" (pleasing) are used correctly according to the context, and the measurements are correctly transcribed. Therefore, no single-word translation errors are present, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
additional → Zusatz → weitere  	motor → Benzinmotoren → Motorisierung  		**Explanation:** "Zusatz" (additional) could be an acceptable variation for "additional", but when joined with "motor" as "Zusatzmotor", it deviates from the intended meaning of "additional motorization". Therefore, identifying "additional" as mistranslated in the context aligns with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "Benzinmotoren" (petrol engines) is a mistranslation of "motor", which should be mortorization not engines which align with "Motoriesierung". Following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors**, the key words identified here are "additional" (Zusatz) and "motor" (Benzinmotoren).
All-wheel drive → Allradfahrer → Allradantrieb		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Allradfahrer" (all-wheel driver), which incorrectly translates "All-wheel drive". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the translation significantly alters the meaning of the subject from a type of vehicle system to a person driving.
handling → Umgang → Fahrverhalten  	speed → Geschwindigkeit → Dynamik  		**Explanation:** "Umgang" (handling as in dealing with) is a mistranslation of "handling" in this context, which likely refers to "Fahrverhalten" (driving behavior/performance) when discussing a vehicle. This adheres to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Geschwindigkeit" (speed) is a more literal translation but doesn't match the nuanced meaning of "Dynamik" (dynamics), which fits the context of vehicle handling, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Die Lenkung könnte jedoch etwas direkter sein" conveys the same meaning as the reference "Die Lenkung dürfte aber etwas direkter sein." The use of "jedoch" and "aber" are both valid translations of "however", and "könnte" and "dürfte" are acceptable translations for "could" in this context. Therefore, no significant single-word errors are present.
fittings → Anpassungen → Ausstattung  		**Explanation:** "Anpassungen" (adjustments) is a mistranslation of "fittings", which refers to the quality or features in the context of the version tested. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "Anpassungen" does not convey the intended meaning of "Ausstattung" (fittings or features).
emergency → Notbremsassistent → City-Notbremsassistent  	lane → Spurenabwarnsystem → Spurhalteassistent  		**Explanation:** "Notbremsassistent" (emergency braking assistant) in the candidate sentence differs from "City-Notbremsassistent" in the reference. The source specifies "city emergency braking assistant," indicating the importance of the city context, which is missed in the candidate. Similarly, "Spurenabwarnsystem" (lane departure warning system) in the candidate sentence is a wrong translation of "Spurhalteassistent" (lane keeping assistant), as "Spurenabwarnsystem" suggests only warning against lane departure, not actively assisting in lane keeping, altering the intended meaning.
**No translation errors detected.**		**Explanation:** The candidate translation preserves the meaning of the source sentence well. The words "Kollisionswarnsystem" (collision warning system), "irritierend" (irritating), and the handling of "Näherungsgegenstände" (approaching objects) fit within the given context. There are no single-word mistranslations that significantly alter the meaning of the sentence, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
high-beam → hochrangige → Fernlicht  		**Explanation:** "hochrangige" (high-ranking) is a mistranslation of "high-beam", which refers to a vehicle lighting system. The **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule guides the extraction of "hochrangige" as the key incorrect word because it doesn't preserve the technical aspect of the original term "high-beam".
intelligent speed regulator → intelligenten Geschwindigkeitskontrollbehörden → intelligente Temporegler  	traffic signage → Verkehrssignale → Verkehrszeichenerkennung  		**Explanation:** "intelligenten Geschwindigkeitskontrollbehörden" (intelligent speed control authorities) is a mistranslation of "intelligent speed regulator." Comparing it to the reference "intelligente Temporegler," we see that the candidate translation suggests an incorrect entity. "Verkehrssignale" (traffic signals) is a mistranslation of "traffic signage." The reference "Verkehrszeichenerkennung" (traffic sign recognition) provides a more accurate translation for signage recognition. Both errors significantly alter the meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
available → vorhanden → gibt  	top-of-the-range → Modell nach oben → Top-Ausstattung  	inch → inteck → Zoll  	connectivity → Verknüpfung → Konnektivität  		**Explanation:** "vorhanden" (existent/present) does not convey the full meaning of "available" as intended in the source. "Modell nach oben" (model upwards) is a mistranslation of "top-of-the-range," which refers to a top specification, not a physical direction or position. "inteck" is a likely mistranslated or garbled version of "inch," which should be "Zoll" in German. Lastly, "Verknüpfung" (linkage) doesn't carry the same meaning as "connectivity," which refers to the capability to connect with other devices or systems.
USB ports → USB-Häfen → USB-Buchse  	HDMI port → HDMI-Hafen → HDMI-Buchse  	armrest → Dach → Armlehne  		**Explanation:** "Häfen" is a mistranslation of "ports"; "Buchse" is the correct translation. "Dach" (roof) is a mistranslation of "armrest". These errors significantly change the meaning of the sentence, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
top-of-the-range → hochmodernes → Top  	fair → fair → in Ordnung  		**Explanation:** "hochmodernes" is a mistranslation of "top-of-the-range." The German "hochmodernes" suggests something cutting edge rather than well-equipped or at the top, which changes the specific nature of the description. The phrase "fair" is not contextually accurate to mean "in Ordnung," which implies a broader acceptance or reasonableness, common when discussing prices.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The usage of "Benzinmodell" and "Diesel" in the candidate translation is contextually acceptable and does not alter the intended meaning from the source sentence. The phrases "von 20 000 Euro" and "von 23 000 Euro" align with the reference's "ab 20000 Euro" and "ab 23000 Euro", which also correctly convey the pricing information, adhering to acceptable translation variations. Despite minor differences in phrasing, the candidate translation successfully captures the essential information and context of the source sentence.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "Emissionsnormen" and "Abgasnorm" both appropriately translate the concept of "emissions standards." Since the candidate translation maintains the meaning of the source sentence and complies with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no significant single-word errors are present.
HR-V → Lkw → HR-V  	diverse → diversifiziertes → vielseitiges  	car → Fahrzeug → Auto  		**Explanation:**  	- "Lkw" (truck) is a mistranslation of "HR-V", a specific model name, which violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "diversifiziertes" (diversified) is a mistranslation of "diverse" in this context, which alters the intended meaning significantly. The correct translation should be "vielseitiges" (versatile), adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Fahrzeug" (vehicle) is a broader term and mismatches the specific context of "car" in the reference. The correct term should be "Auto" (car), aligning with the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
liable → haftbar → haftet  	Fall → Fahren → Sturz  	boarding bridge → Passagier-Bordbrücke → Fluggastbrücke  		**Explanation:** "haftbar" is a mistranslation of "liable"; "haftet" is more contextually appropriate. "Fahren" (driving) does not correctly translate "Fall" (fall), significantly altering the meaning. "Passagier-Bordbrücke" (passenger boarding bridge) does not match "Fluggastbrücke" (boarding bridge), affecting the intended meaning by changing the term used for the specific type of bridge.
fall → Fall → Sturz  	passenger boarding bridge → Passagier-Bordbrücke → Fluggastbrücke  		**Explanation:** "Fall" (case/event) is a mistranslation of "fall," which in this context should be "Sturz" (fall/accident). This error significantly impacts the liability context. Additionally, "Passagier-Bordbrücke" is an incorrect translation for "passenger boarding bridge," which should be "Fluggastbrücke." The latter is the more contextually appropriate term used for such bridges at airports.
(Higher → Oberste → Oberlandes)  	(Regional → Regionalgerichtshof → Gericht)  	(Az.: → A. → Az.:)  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Oberste" is a mistranslation of "Higher" in this context. The correct term for "Higher Regional Court" is "Oberlandesgericht," not "Oberste Regionalgerichtshof."	2. "Regionalgerichtshof" translates to "regional court," but the correct term for "Higher Regional Court" is "Oberlandesgericht."	3. "A." is a mistranslation of "Az.," which should remain as "Az." to denote the case number.
fall → Knackenfall → Sturz  	kneecap → Knackenfall → Kniescheibe  		**Explanation:** "Knackenfall" is not a correct translation of either "fall" or "kneecap" and alters the intended meaning of the sentence. "Sturz" is the correct translation for "fall", and "Kniescheibe" is the correct translation for "kneecap". This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
pronounced → ausgesprochen → so  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses the word "ausgesprochen" (pronounced), which suggests a formal declaration. However, the reference "so" indicates the court simply noted or opined. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the intended meaning in context was not a formal pronouncement, but rather an opinion.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Entschädigung" (compensation), which is a valid translation of the source word "compensation". The reference uses "Schadenersatz", which is another valid term for compensation but does not make "Entschädigung" incorrect in this context. Since the meaning remains intact and both terms are synonyms, this follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:**  	The candidate sentence "Wann bezahlen Organisatoren, wenn Krankheiten auftreten?" translates back to "When do organisers pay if illnesses occur?", which aligns with the source sentence "When do organisers pay if illness strikes?" Although there are some structural differences compared to the reference translation, there are no significant single-word translation errors that alter the meaning of the sentence. This complies with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as both translations effectively communicate the intended message of the source sentence.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** All key elements of the source sentence are accurately covered by the candidate translation. While phrasing differs slightly from the reference, all parts convey the intended meanings adequately, including the conditions under which travellers get their money back, which follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Besucher" and "Gäste" can mean "visitors" or "guests" and do not significantly change the meaning of the sentence. The numerical representation "10%" aligns with "zehn Prozent". The candidate translation conveys the intended meaning present in the source sentence, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
diarrhoea → Diarrhoea → Durchfall  	vomiting → gerissen → Erbrechen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Diarrhoea" remains untranslated in the candidate sentence, which doesn't fit the German sentence structure or context. It should be "Durchfall" following the reference.	2. "Gerissen" (torn) is a mistranslation of "vomiting". The correct German term here is "Erbrechen". This adheres to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, as "gerissen" significantly changes the meaning.
almost → alle → fast  	room → Saal → Zimmer  		**Explanation:**  	1. "alle" (all) is a mistranslation of "almost". In the candidate translation, "alle" implies the entirety, whereas the original meaning is that nearly all of the holiday was spent indoors, captured by "fast". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it changes the extent of time spent.  	2. "Saal" (hall) is a mistranslation of "room". The source sentence conveys that the holiday was spent in a more private and confined space ("room" / "Zimmer"), whereas "Saal" suggests a large, public space. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
blamed → beschuldigt → führten ... zurück  	seawater → Wasser → Meerwasser  		**Explanation:**  	1. "beschuldigt" (accused) is a mistranslation of "blamed" as used in the context of causality rather than direct accusation, aligning with "führten ... zurück" in the reference, which means "attributed" or "led back to". This change affects the interpretation of the action the holidaymakers are taking.  	2. "Wasser" (water) is a mistranslation of "seawater", which the reference translates specifically as "Meerwasser". This error changes the scope of the pollution from general water to the specific body mentioned, the seawater.
opinion → Meinung → Ansicht  	holiday → Urlaub → Reise  	organiser → Organisator → Veranstalter  		**Explanation:**  	- "Meinung" (opinion) is a direct translation but lacks the precise context of "Ansicht" which is more fitting here; this follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Urlaub" (holiday) is typically used for leisure vacations, whereas "Reise" (journey/trip) is slightly more formal and contextually fitting here; this adheres to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Organisator" (organiser) can be translated thus, but "Veranstalter" fits as it signifies a professional or formal event planner; this adheres to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** While "kein Glück" (no luck) in the candidate translation differs from "keinen Erfolg" (no success) in the reference translation, both expressions convey a similar meaning in this context. No significant difference in meaning is detected, so it follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, and no error is reported.
waste treatment plant → Abfallbehandlungsanlage → Kläranlage  		**Explanation:** "Abfallbehandlungsanlage" (waste treatment plant) is a mistranslation of "Kläranlage" (clarification plant/sewage treatment plant). Although related, they refer to different types of facilities. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The rest of the candidate translation's words are acceptable in terms of meaning.
organiser → Organisator → Veranstalter  	claimants → Antragsteller → Kläger  	departed → Abgang → Abreise  		**Explanation:** "Organisator" (organizer) is translated as "Veranstalter" (organizer or event planner), but "Veranstalter" is more contextually accurate for the task of organizing an event. "Antragsteller" (applicants) does not fit as well as "Kläger" (claimants), which is more accurate in a legal context implied by "claimants". Lastly, "Abgang" (departure, but often implies a more permanent leaving like death) does not fit the temporary context of the reference translation, where "Abreise" (journey or trip departure) is more appropriate.
seawater → Wasser → Meerwasser		**Explanation:** "Wasser" (water) is a mistranslation of "seawater", which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence. "Seawater" is specific and refers to "Meerwasser", not just any water, thus violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Each word in the candidate sentence aligns with the source and reference sentences in terms of meaning and context. The words "Organisator", "Informationspflicht", and "verletzt" correctly reflect "organiser", "information obligation", and "violated" respectively, even though the structure and exact phrasing differ slightly between the candidate and reference translations. Thus, no significant meaning change occurs, and the translation is acceptable.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence translates the source effectively and uses the phrase "keine Verschmutzung in Wasserproben gefunden" similarly to how "keine Verunreinigungen in den Proben des Wassers gefunden wurden" is constructed in the reference sentence. There are no significant single-word meanings changed, and both express the intended context.
ill → krank → Erkrankung  	risk → Gefahr → Risiko  		**Explanation:** "krank" (sick) is a less precise translation of "ill" in this context, where "Erkrankung" (illness) matches the reference indicating an ongoing state rather than an incidental condition. "Gefahr" (danger) is a mistranslation of "risk" since "Lebensgefahr" (life danger) implies immediate and serious threats whereas "Lebensrisiko" (life risk) refers to normal everyday risks, aligning better with the reference. Notes on variations like how the reference and candidate have different constructions or phrases are not considered here because the task focuses on word-level errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation correctly conveys the source sentence's meaning. "Nur 38 von 691 Gästen sind erkrankt" and "Von 691 Gästen waren nur 38 erkrankt" both successfully communicate that only 38 guests out of 691 became ill, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, there are no significant errors to report.
Ansbach → Anschbach → Ansbach		**Explanation:** "Anschbach" is a mistranslation of "Ansbach". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it is important to accurately represent place names in translation.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The word choices in the candidate translation ("umsichtig" and "entschlossen") sufficiently capture the intended meaning of "prudence and resolve," and do not significantly alter the message when compared to the reference translation. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where reasonable variations are acceptable as long as the meaning is preserved.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both the candidate and reference translations convey the intended message accurately. The variations between words such as "reagieren" (react) and "beantworten" (respond) are acceptable, as they do not alter the meaning significantly, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The difference between "Sieg" (victory) and "Triumph" (triumph) is minor and does not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, "geben" (give) and "gönnen" (grant) serve similar purposes in this context. Therefore, there are no mistranslations that change the intended meaning of the sentence.
If perpetrators → Täter → Straftäter  	quicker → schneller → schneller  	general public's → Öffentlichkeit → Bevölkerung  		**Explanation:**  	- "Täter" (perpetrators) is a broader term than "Straftäter" (criminals). The context specifies those who are probably involved in illegal activities, thus "Straftäter" is more precise.  	- "schneller" is correctly translated so no error here.  	- "Öffentlichkeit" (public) and "Bevölkerung" (population) are interchangeable in this context as they both refer to the general population. Therefore, no meaningful error here.  		Ultimately, two significant translation errors have been identified: "Täter" and, upon further analysis, "Öffentlichkeit" was noted as a potential error but deemed contextually reasonable, hence flagged but optional for "Bevölkerung".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "De Maizière möchte, dass die Vorschläge vor den Bundeswahlen 2017 umgesetzt werden" accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The use of "möchte" instead of "will" is a permissible variation that doesn't change the intent. Both "vor den Bundeswahlen" and "bis zur Bundestagswahl" convey the time frame correctly. Therefore, there are no significant single-word errors present.
a mid-four figure sum → Mittelvierzahl → mittlerer vierstelliger Größenordnung  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Mittelvierzahl" to translate "a mid-four figure sum," which does not accurately convey the original meaning in the source sentence. "Mittelvierzahl" is not a correct translation and does not fit the intended meaning of the sentence, which in the reference is correctly captured as "mittlerer vierstelliger Größenordnung." This identifies a significant error that changes the meaning conveyed about the scale of the staffing increase.
1. Advertising → Werbung → Sympathiewerbung		**Explanation:** "Werbung" is used more generally for "advertising" or "promotion," while "Sympathiewerbung" specifically conveys the idea of promoting sympathy or support for terrorism, which significantly maintains the intended legal and critical context. This correction follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		2. punishable → bestraft → unter Strafe stehen		**Explanation:** "bestraft" (punished) conveys a completed legal action, whereas "unter Strafe stehen" (to be punishable) implies the status or state of being punishable, aligning with the intended legal framework context. This aligns with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it maintains the necessary meaning in a legal context.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the original meaning of the source sentence. While there are some differences in phrasing, such as "gun laws" translated as "Waffengesetze" versus "Waffenrecht," both are acceptable and convey the intended meaning. Similarly, "purchasing weapons online" is addressed accurately in both translations, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, so no meaningful word-level errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although there are differences in phrasing, such as "Vertraulichkeitsverpflichtungen der Ärzte" vs. "Schweigepflicht für Ärzte", both phrases can refer to confidentiality obligations. The candidate translation maintains the intended meaning and context, so no significant single-word errors are detected according to the provided instructions.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon comparing the candidate translation with the source and reference sentences, all words in the candidate translation express the intended meaning accurately, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. There are no single-word mistranslations that significantly change the meaning of the original sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both the candidate and the reference translations convey the same overall meaning, despite different word order. Each significant word and phrase in the candidate translation has an appropriate counterpart in the reference, maintaining the intended meaning as highlighted by the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essential meaning of the source sentence effectively. Although "Lehrer" and "Lehrkräfte" have slight variations in nuance, they both refer to educators or teachers, and no significant meaning is lost. Other elements like "besser ausgebildet werden" and "besser vorbereitet werden" both convey the concept of improved training or preparation, making them contextually appropriate. Thus, no significant word-level mistranslations are present according to the rules outlined.
Kriminellen → Straftätern → Kriminellen  	Bereichen → Gegenden → Bereichen  	Internets → Internet → Internets  	Darknet → Dark Web → Darknet  	verdeckt → Verdeckungs → verdeckt  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Kriminellen" is the correct term whereas "Straftätern" (offenders) changes the nuance of "criminals".	2. "Bereichen" is the correct word, while "Gegenden" (areas/regions) does not fit the specific meaning intended in context.	3. "Internets" is the correct form, as it is the genitive case used in the reference and source.	4. "Dark Web" is used instead of "Darknet", which slightly changes the specificity, as "Darknet" is a more commonly used term in this context.	5. "verdeckt" is the correct form instead of "Verdeckungs", which does not accurately translate "undercover".
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation adequately matches the meaning of the source and reference sentences. The phrases used are acceptable translations and do not demonstrate any significant mistranslation issues under the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning and key elements of the source sentence. The phrase "He said it was important that" is implied through the use of "Es sei wichtig, dass" in both the candidate and reference translations, which is a common way to convey reported speech in German. The rest of the sentence matches the reference translation precisely, ensuring contextual accuracy and proper rendering of all significant elements.
agitators → Agitatoren → Scharfmacher  		**Explanation:** "Agitatoren" (agitators) is a mistranslation of "Scharfmacher" (rabble-rousers or hawks), which refers more specifically to people who stir up conflict or tension, especially in political contexts. This error violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as it changes the nuance of the sentence.
**coalition → Koalition → Union**  	**nationality → Nationalität → Staatsangehörigkeit**		**Explanation:** "Koalition" (coalition) is used in place of "Union," which may change the political context as "Union" typically refers to a specific political alignment or party grouping in German context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Nationalität" and "Staatsangehörigkeit" both mean "nationality," but the reference prefers "Staatsangehörigkeit" in this context, possibly due to more specific or idiomatic usage in the German political context. However, as this is a subtle preference and not a significant meaning alteration, it is still marked for technical accuracy in exact translation.
views → betrachtet → halte  	full → vollständigen → Vollverschleierung  		**Explanation:** "haltet" is a more appropriate translation in this context where the reference uses "halte er" to express opinion, while "betrachtet" is more neutral. "vollständigen Schleiern" is a mistranslation of "full veils," where "Vollverschleierung" captures the specific context of "full veil" related to garments covering the face completely.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Both "ist gegen" (is against) and "lehnt ab" (oppose) effectively convey opposition, making their functional use in this sentence contextually acceptable. The meaning remains unchanged, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The phrase "im Verkehrsbereich" reasonably captures "with regard to traffic," and "über Zeugen sprechen, die vor Gericht erscheinen" matches the context of "for witnesses appearing in court." While there are slight differences in phrasing when compared to the reference translation, none of these change the sentence's meaning significantly. Thus, no significant single-word translation errors exist according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules.
Head → Chef → Chefin  	accused → beschuldigte → warf vor  	Minister → Ministerin → Minister  	create → erzeugen → simulieren  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Chef" (Chef) is masculine, while "Chefin" in the reference sentence matches the gender correctly with "Head" referring to Simone Peter, a woman. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "beschuldigte" (accused) does not accurately match "warf vor" (implicated), which is a less strong accusation, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	3. "Ministerin" (female minister) does not match "Minister" in the reference, as the gender context is not correctly preserved.	4. "erzeugen" (create) does not convey the nuance of "simulieren" (simulate), which implies falseness or pretense, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
Head → Linksleiter → Linken-Parteichef  	smooth → reibungsloses → Flotte  	talking → Gespräch → Sprüche  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Linksleiter" is a mistranslation of "Head of the Left", where "Linken-Parteichef" (Party Chief of the Left) would be more accurate in this context. This affects the precision of the title.	2. "reibungsloses" (smooth) is a mistranslation of "flotte" (snappy) in this context, as it doesn't convey the intended metaphor of persuasive but superficial words.	3. "Gespräch" (conversation) is a mistranslation of "Sprüche" (expressions or remarks/ sayings), which fits the context better as it indicates superficial speech rather than an actual conversation.
traffic → Straße → Verkehrsfluss  	motorway → Straße → Autobahn  	slip road → Straße → Zubringer 		**Explanation:** 		1. "Straße" (street/road) is used in the candidate translation twice, but it does not accurately convey the meaning of "traffic flow," "motorway," or "slip road." The specific errors are:	   - "traffic" is mistranslated as "Straße" instead of "Verkehrsfluss."	   - "motorway" is mistranslated as "Straße" instead of "Autobahn."	   - "slip road" is mistranslated as "Straße" instead of "Zubringer."		Each of these mistranslations significantly impacts the intended meaning, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
Traffic jams → Verkehrsstaus → staut sich  	photo → Foto → Bild  		**Explanation:** "Verkehrsstaus" (traffic jams) is a mistranslation of the source's phrase "Traffic jams are a regular occurrence," which is more accurately conveyed by "staut sich" (it’s a regular occurrence of traffic congestion) in the reference. The source focuses on the occurrence, fitting "staut sich" better in meaning. Similarly, "Foto" (photo) is a valid translation of "photo," but the reference uses "Bild," which is synonymous and acceptable in German, yet here, "Bild" more closely aligns with the reference's choice, focusing on ensuring consistency with the translation style.
right-hand turning lane → Kehrtwende der Rechten → Rechtsabbiegespur		**Explanation:** "Kehrtwende der Rechten" (U-turn of the right) is a mistranslation of "right-hand turning lane." The phrase significantly alters the meaning, as it suggests a different kind of turn rather than the specific lane which is intended. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by identifying the contextual mismatch. "Rechtsabbiegespur" (right-hand turning lane) is the correct reference word.
1. drivers → Fahrer → Autofahrer	2. rush-hour → Stundenverkehr → Berufsverkehr	3. traffic → Verkehr → Stau	4. bypass → Umgehungsstraße → Umgebungsstraße	5. sit → sitzen → stehen		**Explanation:**  	- "Fahrer" is a more general term compared to "Autofahrer," which specifically refers to "drivers."  	- "Stundenverkehr" doesn't capture the specific meaning of "Berufsverkehr," which refers to "rush-hour" or "commuter" traffic.  	- "Verkehr" generally means "traffic," but "Stau" more accurately means "traffic jam," which is the intended meaning in this context.  	- "Umgehungsstraße" is slightly off as it implies a bypass different from the intended "Umgebungsstraße," which refers to a surrounding or peripheral road in this context.  	- "sitzen" (sit) doesn't fit the context of being "stuck in traffic," where "stehen" (stand/stuck) is more accurate for describing the immobility caused by the traffic jam.
State Roadworks Office → staatliche Roadwork-Büro → Landesbetrieb Straßenbau  	right-hand turning lane → rechte Hand → Rechtsabbiegerspur  	exit → Auszug → Abfahrt  		**Explanation:** "staatliche Roadwork-Büro" is a mistranslation of "State Roadworks Office". The correct term is "Landesbetrieb Straßenbau", as it refers to the official institution responsible for road works. "rechte Hand" (right hand) is incorrectly translated; it should be "Rechtsabbiegerspur", referring to the right-hand turning lane. "Auszug" (excerpt or extract) is also incorrect for "exit"; "Abfahrt" is the correct term in the context of a road exit. These errors violate the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules by significantly altering the intended meaning.
means → bedeutet → einfädeln  	feed → Futtermittel → einfädeln  		**Explanation:** "bedeutet" (means) is used in a structure that doesn't align well with "feed in" in the context of traffic, where "einzufädeln" (merge) is more appropriate. Additionally, "Futtermittel" (feed/animal feed) is a clear mistranslation of "feed in" regarding traffic flow, significantly altering the sentence's meaning. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
advantage → Vorteil → Vorteil  	circuslation → Verbreitung → Ablauf  	busy → - → vielbefahrenen		**Explanation:** 	- "Vorteil" is correctly translated, so there is no mistranslation here.	- "circulation" is mistranslated as "Verbreitung" (distribution), which significantly changes the meaning to a less relevant term in this context compared to “Ablauf” (operation/flow).	- The qualifier "busy" is omitted in the candidate translation altogether, changing the meaning. The reference includes "vielbefahrenen" (busy), which captures the intensity of the road usage correctly.	
CDU fraction → CDU-Bruchteil → CDU-Fraktion  	district → Distriktverwaltung → Bezirks­vertretung  	exit → Ausstiegs → Ausfahrt  		**Explanation:** "Bruchteil" (fraction/piece) is an incorrect translation for "fraction" in this context; the correct term "Fraktion" refers to a political group. "Distriktverwaltung" (district administration) should be "Bezirksvertretung" to match the context of local governmental representation. Finally, "Ausstiegs" (exit) is a mistranslation in this context, where "Ausfahrt" (outlet or exit ramp) is the correct term, fitting better in the context of lengthening an exit route. These errors are significant according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, as they misconstrue key elements of the source sentence.
slip road → Strecke → Zubringer  		**Explanation:** "Strecke" translates to "route" or "track", which does not accurately capture the specific concept of a "slip road" like "Zubringer" does. This word changes the context, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
traffic jam → Verkehrsstaus → Rückstau  		**Explanation:** "Verkehrsstaus" (traffic jams) is a mistranslation of "traffic jam." The German term "Rückstau" (backlog or backup) is more contextually appropriate for the specific type of traffic slowdown occurring in this scenario, especially when referring to traffic congestion.		Albersloher → Albersloher → Albersloher Weg		**Explanation:** "Albersloher" is potentially misleading when translated alone as it should include "Weg" in the context to mean "Albersloher Weg" fully. The missing "Weg" (way) is necessary for accuracy, even though "Albersloher" alone is not incorrect; it is incomplete in this context.
exit → Ausstieg → Abfahrt  	Wessel-Straße → Wessel-Straße → Weseler Straße  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Ausstieg" (exit) is mistranslated in this context as it refers to exiting a vehicle or disembarking. The correct translation for a roadway exit is "Abfahrt".	2. "Wessel-Straße" is a mistranslation of "Weseler Straße", which is important for accuracy in naming conventions.
lane → Verkehrsstrecke → einspurig		**Explanation:** In this context, "Verkehrsstrecke" (traffic route) does not adequately translate "lane," which specifically refers to a single track for vehicles on the bridge, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The correct word "einspurig" (single-lane) captures this specific traffic flow constraint.
eighteen → achtzehn → eindreiviertel		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "achtzehn" (eighteen) instead of "eindreiviertel" (one and three-quarters), which corresponds to a period of approximately 21 months. This is a significant error as it misrepresents the time duration mentioned in the source sentence. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it provides incorrect information regarding the time the lane was removed.
- analysis → Analyse → Berechnungen	- lanes → Strecken → zweispurig		**Explanation:** "Analyse" (analysis) is a mistranslation of "Berechnungen" (calculations), which alters the technical context describing the examination method used. "Strecken" (routes) is a mistranslation of "zweispurig" (two lanes), which specifically refers to the capacity of the bridge to support two lanes of traffic, aligning with the intended meaning.
relevant → zuständigen → zuständige  	rush-hour → Nahrstundenverkehr → werktägliche Stau  		**Explanation:** "zuständigen" (responsible) is a mistranslation of "relevant", which affects the meaning by implying a different type of authority. "Nahrstundenverkehr" (meal hour traffic) is a mistranslation of "rush-hour", significantly altering the context of traffic congestion.
matter → Frage → rechnen  	remain → verwendet → Restnutzdauer  		**Explanation:** "Frage" (question) is a mistranslation of "matter", as "rechnen" (accounted or reckoned with) captures the sense of dealing with the passage of years better in this context. Furthermore, "verwendet" (used) is a mistranslation of "remain", as "Restnutzdauer" (remaining useful life) conveys the continuation of usage until 2034 more accurately within the given timeframe. These errors follow the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules by identifying words that alter the intended meaning.
authorities → Bezirksbehörden → Landesbetrieb  	right-hand turning lane → rechten Hand → Rechtsabbiegespur  		**Explanation:** "Bezirksbehörden" (district authorities) is a mistranslation for "Landesbetrieb" (state or regional authority/service), which can imply a different organizational level in German. "rechten Hand" (right-hand) is a significant mistranslation of "Rechtsabbiegespur" (right-hand turning lane) as it fails to convey the specific traffic context, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
traffic → Strecke → Verkehr		**Explanation:** "Strecke" (route) is a mistranslation of "lane" in this context. The reference uses "einspurig" to accurately convey "in a single lane", which changes the meaning regarding traffic management. This example follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule since the mistranslation could impact understanding of traffic flow.
journey → Weg → Reise  		**Explanation:** "Weg" (path/way) is a mistranslation of "journey". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Reise" (journey) is the more appropriate translation in the context of "intercultural journey".
international → internationale → internationale  	class → Klasse → Klasse  	from → aus → der  	forest → Waldschule → Waldschule  	school → Schule → Schule  	been to see → gesehen → besuchte  	theatre → Theater → Theaterstück  		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence's translation of "been to see" as "gesehen" (seen) differs from the more accurate "besuchte" (visited) in the reference, indicating a difference in nuance – "besuchte" implies not just seeing, but attending or being present at an event. Given the context, "besuchte" alters the sentence meaning in a meaningful way. Following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, this is the only significant error to note. Other terms either match exactly or are acceptable variations that don't change the intended meaning.	
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation successfully captures the meaning of the source sentence. The phrase structure is slightly different with "Vereinigung" vs. "Verein", but both convey the meaning of "association". The term "Migrationshintergrund" effectively conveys "migrant or refugee background", considering it is a common and accepted term in German for people with a migration background. There are no significant changes in meaning, adhering to the rules provided.
performance → Bilanz → Vorstellung  	award-winning → auszeichnenden → preisgekrönten  	Young Theatre → jungen Theater → Jungen Theaters  		**Explanation:**		1. **"performance" → "Bilanz" → "Vorstellung"**: The word "Bilanz" (balance) is a mistranslation of "performance", which should be "Vorstellung" (show). This changes the meaning significantly, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.		2. **"award-winning" → "auszeichnenden" → "preisgekrönten"**: The term "auszeichnenden" (awarding) does not convey the intended meaning of having already received awards ("award-winning"), which should be "preisgekrönten". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		3. **"Young Theatre" → "jungen Theater" → "Jungen Theaters"**: The term "jungen Theater" does not adequately convey the proper noun "Young Theatre," which in this context should refer to the specific entity "Jungen Theaters" ("of the Young Theatre"). The lowercase "j" suggests a common adjective, which changes the sense, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
1. framework → Rahmen → Kontext  	2. set up → eingerichteten → initiierten  	3. play → Spiel → Inszenierung  	4. small → kleinen → Kleinen  		**Explanation:**  	"Rahmen" (frame) is less contextual than "Kontext" (context) when referring to the metaphorical framework or scope. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		"eingerichteten" (set up/furnished) doesn’t capture the initiation aspect as well as "initiierten" (initiated). This again is identified via the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.		"Spiel" (game) doesn't convey the theatrical sense needed here, as "Inszenierung" (production) does, which reflects the original intended meaning following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.		"kleinen" (small), while semantically similar, doesn't capture the specific nuance as effectively as "Kleinen" (capitalized to signify The Small House, likely a proper noun/place name), which is necessary here per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon comparison of each word in the candidate translation with the source and reference translations, the candidate translation appropriately reflects the intended meaning and context of the source. There are no single-word discrepancies that significantly alter the meaning of the sentence. The translation shows accurate conveyance of all key elements, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** guidelines.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essential meaning of the source sentence. "Jungen Menschen" (young people) is a valid translation of “young people.” The word orders and slight form variations, like "dem Iran" vs. "Iran," do not change the meaning significantly, and "kamen" and "gekommen" are both valid conveyances of the past tense action. Thus, per the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, there are no significant translation errors to report.
scenic images → Szenen → szenischen Bilder  	plot → Komplott → Handlungsverlauf  	Young Theatre → junger Theater → Jungen Theaters  		**Explanation:**  	- "scenic images" is mistranslated as "Szenen" (scenes) instead of "szenischen Bilder" (scenic images), which significantly alters the intended description of what helped follow the plot.	- "plot" is mistranslated as "Komplott" (conspiracy) instead of "Handlungsverlauf" (plot), changing the meaning significantly. 	- "Young Theatre" is mistranslated as "junger Theater" instead of "Jungen Theaters" (Young Theatre). This affects the identification of the theater mentioned in the press release.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the key details and meaning of the source sentence accurately when compared to the reference translation. Both translations mention the founding by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg, the collaboration with the Young Theatre, and working on a musical theatre project in the next season. The differences such as "in der nächsten Saison" and "in der kommenden Spielzeit" ("next season") are acceptable variations and do not significantly alter the intended meaning. Thus, there are no significant single-word translation errors according to the given instructions.
migrant → Migrationshintergrund → Fluchthintergrund		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation, "Migrationshintergrund und ohne Flüchtlingshintergrund" separates "migrant" and "refugee" backgrounds with an additional "without", which is not present in the reference translation. The correct translation should keep these backgrounds combined, as seen in "Flucht- und Migrationshintergrund". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the intent is to address both conditions together, impacting the meaning.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Even though "wird fortgesetzt" and "geht weiter" are different translations, both phrases accurately convey the meaning of "continues" in this context. Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, they are considered acceptable variations. Additionally, "Interkulturelle Reise" and "Interkulturellen Reise" are grammatically correct variations that do not alter the meaning of the sentence. Thus, no significant translation errors are present.
association → Organisation → Verein		**Explanation:** "Organisation" (organization) is a mistranslation of "association", which changes the specific entity being referred to. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as "Verein" is a more accurate translation of "association" in this context.
shooting stars → Sterne → Sternschnuppen  		**Explanation:** "Sterne" (stars) is a mistranslation of "shooting stars", as it does not capture the specific concept of "Sternschnuppen". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it loses the distinctive aspect of shooting stars.
spot → schießen → Guckern  	shooting stars → Schießstars → Sternschnuppen  	put paid to → bezahlt → einen Strich durch die Rechnung gemacht  		**Explanation:**  	1. "schießen" (to shoot) is a mistranslation of "spot" (to spot or watch), violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule by changing the activity from observing to shooting.	2. "Schießstars" is a direct mistranslation of "shooting stars". The correct term for meteors is "Sternschnuppen", not a combination translating literally to "shooting stars".	3. "bezahlt" (paid) is a mistranslation of "put paid to", which means to put an end to something. The idiomatic expression "einen Strich durch die Rechnung gemacht" captures the intended meaning in German, so "bezahlt" is incorrect according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
(overnight → von heute auf morgen → Nacht)	(celestial → zentralen → Himmelsspektakel)		**Explanation:** 		- "overnight" is mistranslated as "von heute auf morgen" (from today to tomorrow), which is incorrect in this context. The correct translation, "Nacht" (night), captures the intended timeframe.	  	- "celestial" is mistranslated as "zentralen" (central), which alters the meaning related to the type of show. The correct term, "Himmelsspektakel," reflects the intended focus on an astronomical event. This significantly changes the nature of the event being referenced.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Freitag abend" and "Nacht zum Samstag" can be interpreted as Friday night. While there is a difference in emphasis on when the night starts or ends, this does not significantly change the meaning of the sentence. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule since the core of the message is retained in both translations.
shooting stars → Sterne → Sternschnuppen  		**Explanation:** "Sterne" (stars) is a mistranslation of "shooting stars". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because it changes the specific meaning referring to meteors versus general stars.
shooting stars → Schießstars → Sternschnuppen  		**Explanation:** "Schießstars" is a mistranslation of "shooting stars". The correct term in this context for "shooting stars" is "Sternschnuppen". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Schießstars" does not convey the same meaning as "shooting stars" in astronomy.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the reference translation. Words like "Konstellation" and "Sternbild", both meaning "constellation", are interchangeable in this context. Similarly, the structure and meaning of the entire sentence, including the direction "im Nordosten" and the visibility aspect, are preserved. Therefore, no significant single-word mistranslation changes the meaning of the sentence, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
silent → Schweigen → Erholsame		**Explanation:** "Schweigen" (silence) is a mistranslation of "silent" because it incorrectly conveys the noun form "silence" rather than the adjective implying calmness or restfulness, which is correctly translated as "Erholsame" (restful/quiet in the context of night promoting sleep). This aligns with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it changes the intended connotation of the night being restful.
- evening → Abend → Abends	- whirring → jammern → wälzt sich herum	- morning → Vormittag → morgens	- sleep → schlafen → an Schlaf zu denken		**Explanation:**  	- "Abend" (evening) should be "Abends" to correctly indicate the temporal context, as used in the reference.	- "jammern" (complaining) is an incorrect translation of "whirring", which should convey restless thoughts ("wälzt sich herum").	- "Vormittag" (forenoon/mid-morning) does not match "morning", which should be "morgens".	- "schlafen" (to sleep) alters the meaning intended by "sleep is far from your mind", correctly translated as "an Schlaf zu denken" in the reference.
relaxing → nachgiebig → erholsam  		**Explanation:** "nachgiebig" (yielding) is a mistranslation of "relaxing," which significantly alters the intended meaning. The correct word in this context is "erholsam" (relaxing), in accordance with the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** 	The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning and intent of the source sentence, despite some variations in wording compared to the reference translation. The key elements, such as statistics and context, are correctly translated. There are no single-word mistranslations that significantly change the meaning of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** "zutage treten" (emerge or manifest) and "äußern sich" (express themselves) are both valid translations of "manifest", and thus the candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source sentence. According to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, there is no significant semantic difference to report as a translation error.
- emphasises → Betonung → betont		**Explanation:** "Betonung" (emphasis) is a mistranslation of "emphasises". The candidate sentence incorrectly uses a noun form instead of the verb form, altering the sentence structure and meaning. In the reference, "emphasises" is correctly translated as "betont", a verb, which maintains the intended meaning and grammatical function in the sentence.
insomnia → Unmenschlichkeit → Insomnie		**Explanation:** "Unmenschlichkeit" (inhumanity) is a mistranslation of "insomnia". This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule because "Unmenschlichkeit" radically changes the meaning intended in the context of sleep disorders.
people → Menschen → Menschen  	throughout the night → in der ganzen Nacht → Durchschlafen  	Varel → Varela → Varel  		**Explanation:** 	1. "Menschen" (people) is not a mistranslation; it's preserved correctly. Including it is an oversight; removing it adheres to the **No translation errors detected** condition based on direct mistranslation criteria.		2. "in der ganzen Nacht" (throughout the night) is a mistranslation. The reference focuses on "Durchschlafen" (sleeping through), reflecting an issue with continuous sleep rather than the temporal span "throughout the night."		3. "Varela" is a clear mistranslation of "Varel." In the context of geographical locations, names must be accurate. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although "für" and "von" are different prepositions ("for" vs. "of"), in this context, both "Ursachen für" and "Ursachen von" can be used to express "causes of" in German. The meaning remains intact, so it follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
biological → biologische → organische	psychological → psychologische → psychische	behavioural → verhaltensbezogene → verhaltensbedingte
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Eine Schlafstörung ist oft Ausdruck einer anderen Krankheit" correctly conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The variation from the reference translation is acceptable as "Ausdruck" for "reflection" and "Krankheit" for "illness" are synonymous with "Erkrankung". Additionally, "often" is accurately translated to "oft", which aligns with "nicht selten" (literally "not rarely") used in the reference, thus maintaining the intended meaning. Hence, there are no single-word translation errors to report.
waking up → Erwachen → Aufwachen	very early → (missing) → Sehr frühes	with → mit → bei	common → verbunden → häufig		**Explanation:**  	1. **Waking up → Erwachen → Aufwachen:** The candidate uses "Erwachen," which is more general than "Aufwachen." This doesn't specify "waking up" in the context given.	2. **Very early → (missing) → Sehr frühes:** The candidate translation omits "very early," a key part of the source sentence.	3. **With → mit → bei:** The word "mit" is used in the candidate, while "bei" is used in the reference, providing a clearer connection in context when referring to depression.	4. **Common → verbunden → häufig:** "Verbunden" (connected) changes the meaning somewhat, as it doesn't convey the regularity implied by "häufig" (common).
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essence of the source sentence accurately. Although "mehrere" (several) is not word-for-word matched by "verschiedene" (various), they are near-synonyms in this context and do not significantly change the meaning. Additionally, "gegenseitig beeinflussen" (influence each other) and "einander bedingen" (condition one another) convey a similar concept in context, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
slipped disk → Lapsus → Bandscheibenvorfall  	lie down → niederzuschlagen → liegen  	grumble → streiten → grübeln  	suggests → suggeriert → gibt  	Weeß → Schweß → Weeß  		**Explanation:**		1. "Lapsus" (slip) is a mistranslation of "slipped disk", which is correctly translated as "Bandscheibenvorfall".	2. "Niederzuschlagen" (to knock down) is incorrect for "lie down", which in context should be "liegen".	3. "Streiten" (argue) is a mistranslation of "grumble", which should be "grübeln" (to brood, ponder).	4. "Suggeriert" (suggests) does not fit the context as well as "gibt" (gives), which matches the usage in the reference.	5. "Schweß" is a mistranslation of the name "Weeß" due to a typographical error. The name should remain unchanged.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence closely conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence, with "Spannungen" (tensions) and "man kann nicht schlafen" (one cannot sleep) as valid interpretations aligning with the reference. This complies with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, as both "Spannungen" and "kann nicht schlafen" are appropriate translations in context.
see → sehen → mit		**Explanation:** The German translation "sehen" (see) does not accurately capture the meaning of "consulting" or "visiting" a doctor in this context. The reference uses "mit" as part of the phrase "mit ... zum Arzt," which better conveys the intended action of seeking medical advice for sleep disorders. This addresses the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
sleep → schlaft → schläft  	impacts → beeinflusst → beeinträchtigt  	see → sehen → gehen  	advises → den Ratgeber → rät  		**Explanation:**  	- "schlaft" (you sleep) is an incorrect conjugation and should be "schläft" to match proper subject-verb agreement.	- "beeinflusst" (influences) is not the most accurate translation for "impacts" in this context, which should be "beeinträchtigt" (affects).	- "sehen" (see) in "einen Arzt sehen" doesn't convey the idiomatic meaning of "to visit a doctor"; "gehen" (go) is more appropriate here.	- "den Ratgeber" (the advisor) is incorrect. "rät" (advises) is the correct verb following Weeß as a subject.
poorly rested → schlecht ruhig → unausgeschlafen  	staying alert → Warnschwierigkeiten → Aufmerksamkeit  	irritable → irritabel → reizbar  	mood swings → Stimmgewebe → Stimmungsschwankungen  		**Explanation:**  	- "schlecht ruhig" (badly calm) is a mistranslation of "poorly rested". The appropriate translation should be "unausgeschlafen".	- "Warnschwierigkeiten" (difficulties warning) is not a correct translation for "staying alert", which should be "Aufmerksamkeit".	- "irritabel" is a mistranslation of "irritable" as it is not commonly used in this context in German, "reizbar" is preferred.	- "Stimmgewebe" (voice tissue) is a mistranslation of "mood swings", which should be "Stimmungsschwankungen".
disorder → Schlafkrankheit → Schlafstörung  		**Explanation:** "Schlafkrankheit" (sleep illness) is a mistranslation of "sleep disorder". This significantly alters the meaning because a "disorder" refers to a range of sleep-related issues, while "Krankheit" implies a specific illness, violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules as it changes the context of the health condition being discussed.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation correctly captures the meaning of the source sentence. Each major component of the list (Behaviour changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, medication) is translated accurately. The use of "traditionelle Schlaftabletten" aligns with "traditional sleeping tablets," and the rest of the sentence maintains the meaning with minor acceptable variations in word choice, not affecting the overall intent or meaning. Thus, no significant translation errors are present when applying the given instructions and rules.
registered → eingetragene → niedergelassene  	emphasises → Betonung liegt auf → betont  	Fietze → Fix → Fietze  	medicine → Arzneimittel → Medizin  	Centre → Arzneimittelzentrum → Zentrums  		**Explanation:** 	- "eingetragene" (registered) is a mistranslation of "niedergelassene" (established/private practice) as per the medical context, leading to a misunderstanding of the type of doctors being referenced.	- "Betonung liegt auf" (focus is on) is not correct compared to "betont" (emphasizes), changing the role and action of Prof. Ingo Fietze.	- "Fix" is an incorrect name substitution for "Fietze", which is the correct name.	- "Arzneimittel" (medicine in the sense of pharmaceuticals) is incorrect for "Medizin" (medicine in the treating sense) in this context of a Sleep Medicine Centre.	- "Arzneimittelzentrum" is inaccurately referring to "Zentrum" (Centre), indicating an incorrect contextual reference.
(recommends → empfehlen → rät)  		**Explanation:** "empfehlen" (recommend) is a mistranslation of "recommends" as a promissory suggestion rather than a direct advice or caution, whereas "rät" (advises) is the correct word in context, maintaining the meaning of providing a recommendation or advice.
doctor → Arzt → der		**Explanation:** In the source sentence, "your doctor" is translated in the candidate as "Ihr Arzt" (your doctor), while the reference translation uses "Der" (The), which is an error in capturing the personalized ownership "your". The main point here is the significance of "doctor". Despite not exactly matching the reference, the candidate still keeps the context intact regarding the entity performing the action. However, the phrase "prüfen" implies a different meaning of "check or test" rather than the more accurate "examine" intended here.		No other translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Although "Schlaflab" is a commonly used short form for "Schlaflabor", it maintains the intended meaning in context. Similarly, "geschieht" and "passiert" are acceptable variations in this context, neither changing the meaning nor impacting understanding. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
snoring → Verleumdung → Schnarchen  	sleep lab → Schlafzetteln → Schlaflabor  	abnormally sleepy → ungewöhnlich schlaflos → krankhafter Tagesmüdigkeit  	sleepwalkers → Schlafmänner → Schlafwandlern  	Fietze → Fix → Fietze  		**Explanation:**		1. "Verleumdung" (defamation) is a mistranslation of "snoring". This is a significant error as "Verleumdung" does not relate to breathing disruptions, violating the **Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "Schlafzetteln" (sleep notes) is incorrect for "sleep lab". The correct word is "Schlaflabor", significantly altering the intended meaning and violating **Single-Word Error** rule.	3. "ungewöhnlich schlaflos" (unusually sleepless) is incorrect for "abnormally sleepy". This impacts the sentence's meaning regarding daytime sleepiness, following **Meaningful Errors** priority.	4. "Schlafmänner" (sleep men) is incorrect for "sleepwalkers". "Schlafwandlern" is the contextually accurate term, as per the **Contextual Accuracy** rule.	5. "Fix" is not a recognized contextually accurate change from "Fietze", adhering to **Contextual Accuracy** as it misidentifies the person referenced.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Prüfung" and "Untersuchung" can translate to "examination" in English, with minor contextual differences. The core meaning of necessity regarding preparation, as expressed in the candidate and reference translations, remains consistent with the source sentence. Therefore, there are no significant meaningful errors, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation's use of "Normalerweise" (normally) and the reference translation's use of "normal" (normal) are acceptable variations to render "normally" in this context. While the structure and exact phrasing differ, these differences do not result in a significant change in meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
afternoon nap → Nachmittagsnap → Mittagsschlaf  	Fietze → Fix → Fietze  		**Explanation:** "Nachmittagsnap" is a mistranslation of "afternoon nap" because it uses an anglicized version that doesn't fit the German language context, whereas "Mittagsschlaf" accurately conveys the intended meaning. "Fietze" is also mistranslated as "Fix", which significantly changes the speaker's identity. These errors violate both the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules.
cabled → Kabeljagd → Verkabeln  		**Explanation:** "Kabeljagd" (cable hunt) is a mistranslation of "cabled" (Verkabeln), which changes the meaning in context. "Verkabeln" refers to the process of setting up or connecting with cables, which aligns with the context, unlike "Kabeljagd" which significantly alters the intended action.
electrodes → im → am  	nasal cannula → Nasalkonsula → Nasenbrille  	belt → Gürtel → Brustgurt  	chest → Kaste → Brust  		**Explanation:**  	- "im" (in) is a mistranslation of "on" (am), resulting in incorrect localization of the electrodes, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Nasalkonsula" doesn't exist as a term in German, whereas "Nasenbrille" is the correct term for "nasal cannula", which represents a significant **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule error.	- "Gürtel" (belt) does not specify "Brustgurt" (chest belt), losing specificity which is essential for the context, thus violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors**.	- "Kaste" (crate) is a significant mistranslation of "chest" (Brust), a clear **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule violation for the intended body location.
ceiling → Obergrenzen → Decke  	records → angehäuft → zeichnet auf  	sleeper → Schlafer → Schlafenden  		**Explanation:** "Obergrenzen" (upper limits) is a mistranslation of "ceiling" which significantly changes the meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "angehäuft" (piled up) is a mistranslation of "records", changing the action being described, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "Schlafer" (incorrect form of "sleeper") should be "Schlafenden", following the correct grammatical form in context, thus violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
affected → Betroffenen → Betroffene  	get a grip → aufnehmen → in den Griff kriegen  		**Explanation:** "Betroffenen" retains the definite article "die," which is unnecessary in the context of translating "those affected" and introduces a difference in meaning. "aufnehmen" is a mistranslation of "get a grip," shifting the meaning to "take in" rather than "manage" or "control," which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation is a reasonable interpretation of the source sentence, maintaining the overall intent and meaning. Although there are differences in phrasing, such as "areas" translated as "Bereiche" instead of the more idiomatic "Stellschrauben," these do not significantly alter the meaning in a way that would merit identifying a translation error according to the given instructions. The phrase "den Schlaf der Nacht zu verbessern" effectively captures the notion of "a better night's sleep," therefore no single-word mistranslations need to be reported.
- going → ansteigen → Aufstehzeiten	- staying → stehen → liegen	- watching → schlafen → fernsehen	- clock → Uhr → Uhr schauen	- start working → zu arbeiten → zu rechnen
missing → vermissten → fehlenden  	swimming → Schwimmmedaillen → Medaillen im Schwimmen  		**Explanation:** "vermissten" (missing as in lost) and "fehlenden" (missing as in lacking) imply different concepts in this context, changing the meaning to loss rather than absence. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. "Schwimmmedaillen" (swimming medals) is too specific compared to "Medaillen im Schwimmen" (medals in swimming), missing the structural match, but focusing on "swimming" aligns single-word errors per the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, and the variations in phrasing between the candidate and reference translations are acceptable. "berichtete" (reported) serves a similar function to "geäußert" (expressed), and there are no significant changes in meaning. Thus, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no errors are reported.
December → Dezember → Dezember		Short Course Swimming Championships → Short-Curse-Swimming-Champions → Kurzbahnweltmeisterschaften		first → erste → erstmals		gold medal → Goldmedaille → Gold		world record → Weltbilanz → Weltrekord		**Explanation:**		1. **Short Course Swimming Championships → Short-Curse-Swimming-Champions → Kurzbahnweltmeisterschaften:** The phrase "Short-Curse-Swimming-Champions" appears to be a mistranslation of "Short Course Swimming Championships," significantly altering the meaning by introducing incorrect words and structure. The correct term in German is "Kurzbahnweltmeisterschaften," focusing on the correct term "Kurzbahn" for "Short Course."		2. **first → erste → erstmals:** The word "erstmals" (for the first time) accurately captures the intended meaning of achieving something the first time, while "erste" in the context of the sentence changes the timing aspect of the sentence.		3. **gold medal → Goldmedaille → Gold:** While "Goldmedaille" (gold medal) is a common term, the focus in both the source and reference seems to be on winning "gold" rather than specifying the medal. However, this could be a less significant change.		4. **world record → Weltbilanz → Weltrekord:** "Weltbilanz" is not an equivalent term for "world record," as "Weltrekord" is the appropriate and direct translation. This changes the meaning as "Weltbilanz" might relate to a world balance, not the sporting context of a record.		Note: The primary errors are critical word mistranslations that alter the sentence's intended meaning. Some terms are slightly altered, but not as critical except when forming the incorrect structure significantly, like in the championship reference.
1. athlete → Athlete → Athlet  	2. on → in → via  	3. forward → aufgetan → gestellt  	4. ex-teammates → Teamate → Ex-Teamkollegen  		**Explanation:** "Athlete" is a mistranslation due to an improper noun form; the correct term is "Athlet". "On" is translated as "in", where "via" captures the correct context. "Forward" translated as "aufgetan" is incorrect in this context; "gestellt" is more appropriate. "Teamate" is a misspelling and mistranslation of "Ex-Teamkollegen", which changes the context. Each error violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rules.
Olympic champion → Olympischer Fürsprecher → Olympiasieger  	King of the Jungle → König des Dschungels → Dschungelkönig  		**Explanation:** "Olympischer Fürsprecher" (Olympic advocate) is a mistranslation of "Olympic champion", which is translated as "Olympiasieger". This error significantly changes the meaning because an advocate and a champion imply very different roles. Additionally, "König des Dschungels" is a direct but less idiomatic translation for "gives the sense of a title, whereas "Dschungelkönig" is more accurate in context. Both errors impact the understanding of the sentence.
remuneration → Entschädigung → Fördersystem  	swimming → Schwimmen → Schwimmsport  	tests → Dopingtests → Dopingkontrollen  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Entschädigung" (compensation) is a mistranslation for "remuneration" since "Fördersystem" (funding/support system) more accurately captures the intended meaning related to support systems in sports.	2. "Schwimmen" (swimming, noun) does not completely convey "Schwimmsport" (swimming sport), which provides context relevant to sports.	3. "Dopingtests" (doping tests) doesn't precisely match "Dopingkontrollen" (doping controls), which refers to a broader context of regulatory actions, aligning with the reference sentence.
pay → Aufmerksamkeit schenken → fördern  	pay → nicht so genau hinsehen → nicht aufmerksam sein  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Aufmerksamkeit schenken" (pay attention) is not a correct translation for "pay" in the context of "pay a lot" regarding the competitive advantage. Here, "fördern" (promote or pay) is the correct reference term.	2. The phrase "nicht so genau hinsehen" (not look closely) in the reference translation aligns with "don't pay as much attention." The candidate translation does not accurately capture this meaning with "Aufmerksamkeit schenken" (pay attention), which does not imply "pay a lot" or "not pay attention." The phrase "nicht so genau hinsehen" (not look closely) better captures to "not pay as much attention," synonymous with "nicht aufmerksam sein."
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and matches the essential elements of the reference translation. Although there are different choices for some verbs, such as "weiter" (farther) vs. "weiterhin" (continued), these are acceptable variations. Therefore, based on the provided sentences, no significant single-word translation errors were found.
comeback → Gründung → Comeback		**Explanation:** "Gründung" (founding/establishment) is a mistranslation of "comeback," which significantly alters the intended meaning of returning or restarting an activity, as per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely matches the intended meaning of the source sentence. "Genau so sollte es mit den Ländern sein" is an acceptable translation of "This is exactly how it should be with countries." Any differences between the reference and candidate translations are acceptable variations and do not significantly change the meaning, thus adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
submit → unterwerfen → kontrolliert  	resident → Bewohner → Wahl-Hamburger  	runs → führt → betreibt  	ice-cream parlour → Eiscrem-Parfarm → Eisdiele  		**Explanation:**  	- "unterwerfen" (submit) is a mistranslation of "submit", which needs to convey the idea of being available for checks or controls, hence "kontrolliert" (controlled).	- "Bewohner" literally means "resident", but "Wahl-Hamburger" (by choice Hamburger) is a more contextually appropriate term in this sentence according to the reference.	- "führt" (leads or runs, in the sense of a business) slightly differs from "betreibt" (operates) in context and matches the reference better.	- "Eiscrem-Parfarm" is a non-standard word for "ice-cream parlour", while "Eisdiele" is the correct term.
gang → Festnahme → Bande	thieves → Gepäckdiebstählen → Gepäckdieben		**Explanation:** "Festnahme" (arrest) is mistranslated for "gang" instead of "Bande". "Gepäckdiebstählen" (luggage thefts) is mistranslated for "thieves" (Gepäckdieben), changing the subject of the arrest. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as both these translations alter the meaning substantially.
professional → berufliche → professionelle  	at → auf → am  		**Explanation:** "Berufliche" (occupational) is a mistranslation of "professional", which changes the intended description of the thieves as being skilled at their craft rather than simply referencing their line of work. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule. Additionally, "auf" (on) is not the best translation in this context, where "am" (at) more accurately conveys the location, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although there are differences in wording between the candidate and reference translations, they both convey the same meaning of the source sentence. The candidate translation uses a valid structure to express "plain clothes officers" as "Polizeibeamten," which is a synonymous and acceptable variation given the context. The rest of the key information about the arrests and ages is accurately translated. Thus, no single-word mistranslations are detected.
bags → Stacheln → Taschen  		**Explanation:** "Stacheln" (spikes) is a mistranslation of "bags", which significantly alters the meaning and context of the sentence. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Stacheln" does not fit the intended meaning of the source sentence. No other single-word translation errors were detected.
civil → Beamte → zivile		**Explanation:** The word "Beamte" (officials) is used in the candidate translation, while the reference uses "zivile Beamte" (civil servants). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because the specific type of official ("civil servants") is important for understanding who recognized the gang.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon reviewing the candidate and reference translations, both adequately convey the same meaning from the source sentence. While there are slight variations in phrasing, such as "Verbrechen" (crimes) and "Delikte" (offences), these do not significantly alter the meaning in the context provided. Therefore, no errors are detected, adhering to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although there are some variations between the candidate and reference translations, they both accurately convey the intended meaning from the source sentence. The terms "Fachleute" (specialists) and "Spezialisten" (specialists), "34. Polizeiinspektion" (34th police inspectorate) and "Kriminalkommissariats 34" (34th criminal commissariat), "Verbrechen" (crimes) and "Taten" (acts) are semantically aligned in the context. Therefore, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rules, no significant mistranslation is present.
**No translation errors detected.** 		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Sie hatten dadurch mehr als 15 000 Euro verdient." captures the meaning of the source sentence well. Although there are variations in the expression ("dadurch" instead of "dabei" and "verdient" instead of "erbeutet"), they do not significantly alter the intended meaning. Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, no single-word translation errors are present.
couple → paar → Paar  	linden → Lundenbäume → Lindenbäumchen  	cobblestones → Kopfsteine → Kopfsteinpflaster  	dangerous → gefährlichsten → "Gefährlichen Orten"		**Explanation:** 	- "paar" (pair) should be capitalized as "Paar" when it is a noun, but here it serves as an adjective equivalent to "few," so it remains lowercase. The mistranslation here is more contextual as "Paar" was intended to reference the numbered count in the sentence context.	- "Lundenbäume" is not a valid German word. The correct translation for "linden trees" in this context is "Lindenbäumchen" (little linden trees), following the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule to ensure accurate translation.	- "Kopfsteine" is an incomplete translation of "cobblestones", which in the reference sentence translates to "Kopfsteinpflaster." This preserves the concept of cobblestones as paving material, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "gefährlichsten" (most dangerous) does not convey the specific recognized police status of "Gefährlichen Orten," violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
east → Ost → Osten  	painted → gezeichnete → gestrichenen  	kindergarten → Kindergärten → Kindergarten  	health-food → Gesundheitshof → Bioladen  		**Explanation:**  	- "Ost" (east) should be "Osten" in this context to match the reference; "Ost" does not coherently set the direction compared to "West".	- "gezeichnete" (drawn) is a mistranslation of "painted" which should be "gestrichenen" (painted), drastically changing the meaning.	- "Kindergärten" (kindergartens) plural is a mistranslation when the source refers to a singular "kindergarten".	- "Gesundheitshof" (health farm) is a mistranslation of "health-food" which is properly translated as "Bioladen", a health-food store or organic shop.
spraypainted → gezeichnet → gesprüht		**Explanation:** "gezeichnet" (drawn) is a mistranslation of "spraypainted" which significantly changes the method of how the action was conducted. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as the reference uses "gesprüht" to reflect the act of spraypainting.
Lidl → einer → einem  	pulled → abgerissen → abgerissen  	to rend → Rentenabteilungen → Mietwohnungen  		**Explanation:** 		1. "Lidl" is followed by "einer" in the candidate sentence, which changes the gender of the article incorrectly. It should match the neutral gender "einem" as used in the reference.	2. The word "pulled" is correctly translated as "abgerissen" and should not be included as an error. My initial annotation was incorrect; I do apologize for that.	3. "to rend" is mistranslated as "Rentenabteilungen" (pension departments), which is a clear mistranslation of "Mietwohnungen" (rent/apartments to be leased). The term changes the meaning substantially, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence when compared to the reference translation. The variations observed, such as "Trendbezirk" vs. "trendigen Stadtteil" and "veranschaulicht" vs. "bebildert," do not significantly alter the meaning, and both are acceptable translations within the given context. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, so no errors are reported.
squatters → Quattern → besetzt	rental → Mietenverträge → Mietverträge	ground floor → Boden → Erdgeschoss		**Explanation:** 	- "Quattern" is not a correct German word; it seems to be an erroneous translation attempt for "squatters." The reference uses "besetzt," referring to the state of being occupied by squatters.	- "Mietenverträge" is incorrect for "rental contracts"; the correct term is "Mietverträge," as seen in the reference.	- "Boden" translates to "ground" but not the "ground floor" of a building. The correct term is "Erdgeschoss," as used in the reference translation.
Senator → Innenminister → Innensenator  	autonomous → selbständige → autonomer  		**Explanation:**  	- "Senator" is translated as "Innenminister" instead of "Innensenator." The role of "Innensenator" is specific in the reference, and the translation should reflect the correct title according to the provided context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "autonomous" is translated as "selbständige" which means "independent" in English, whereas "autonomer" directly translates to "autonomous," preserving the intended meaning. This error is prioritized as it changes the nuance of the violence described, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
1. ground → Boden → Erdgeschoss  	2. Kadtermiede → Kadtermiede → Kadterschmiede  	3. patrolled → kontrollierte → patrouillierte  	4. vans → Vans → Mannschaftswagen  	5. house → Haus94 → Haus mit der Nummer 94  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Boden" (ground/floor) incorrectly translates "ground floor" which should be "Erdgeschoss" as it refers to the bottom, not just the floor.	2. "Kadtermiede" is a typo for "Kadterschmiede", which is the correct name of the place.	3. "kontrollierte" (controlled) does not fit the context of "patrolled", which is "patrouillierte" in German.	4. "Vans" is a loan word but "Mannschaftswagen" provides a more context-appropriate term in German for police vehicles.	5. "Haus94" translates to "house" but it omits the specific wording "mit der Nummer 94", which specifies the house number as part of an address.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** In the candidate translation, the words used correctly convey the meaning and context of the source sentence in line with the reference translation. Variations such as "Während dieser Zeit" vs. "Währenddessen" and "im Namen" vs. "im Auftrag" still preserve the overall meaning and do not significantly alter the sense of the sentence. Therefore, there are no significant single-word errors to report.
Court → Verwaltungsgerichtshof → Verwaltungsgericht  	clearing → Clearing → Räumung  	one day → eines Tages → einen Tag  	left → verlassen → zogen ab  	cheers → Helfershelfern → Jubel  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation contains several mistranslations:	- "Verwaltungsgerichtshof" (Administrative High Court) is not the same as "Verwaltungsgericht" (Administrative Court), violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	- "Clearing" is a false friend here, where "Räumung" (eviction) is the intended meaning, fitting the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	- "eines Tages" (some day) changes the temporal context, while "einen Tag" (one day) is accurate.	- "verlassen" (left) does not encompass the same finality as "zogen ab" (withdrew), which fits the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	- "Helfershelfern" (helpers) is a mistranslation for "Jubel" (cheers), altering the reaction described.
children → Kindern → Kindern  	steps → Schaltern → Bürgersteig  	off-licence → Freibrief → Späti  		**Explanation:** "Kindern" is correctly translated. "Schaltern" (switches) is a mistranslation of "steps," which should be "Bürgersteig" (sidewalk/steps in this context), violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "Freibrief" (license/letter of marque) is a mistranslation of "off-licence," which should be "Späti" (a type of late-night shop/off-licence in German context), violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
house project → Hauses → Hausprojekte		**Explanation:** The source sentence refers to "near the house project", which implies a singular "house project". The candidate uses "Hause" (house) in a singular sense, while the reference translation uses "Hausprojekte" in plural form. However, "house project" is distinctly a singular noun phrase, so "Hause" here is technically incorrect in the context given, focusing on the project rather than the house in a general sense. Therefore, this mismatches the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
violence → Menschen → Gewalt  	worries → betroffen → Hauptsorge  	most → am stärksten bewohnten → die Hauptsorge vieler  	has lived → der lebt → die wohnt  	here → hier drei → hier  	are irritated → verärgert → genervt  		**Explanation:**  	1. "Menschen" (people) is a mistranslation of "violence," significantly altering the sentence's meaning.  	2. "betroffen" (affected) is a mistranslation of "worries," which changes the sentence's intended concern focus.  	3. "am stärksten bewohnten" (most inhabited) is a mistranslation of "most" in the context of concern, which significantly changes the meaning.  	4. "der lebt" (who lives) is used for 'Kerstin,' which is incorrect as it refers to a female subject; thus, "die wohnt" is correct.  	5. "hier drei" refers to "here," but the structure changes meaning and is incorrect.  	6. "verärgert" (annoyed) is a mistranslation of "are irritated," which can imply a different emotional nuance compared to "genervt" (irritated), significantly changing the sentence meaning.
inhabitants → Bewohner → Bewohnern  	fear → Angst → Sorge  	gentrification → Vergneidung → Gentrifizierung  		**Explanation:**  	- "Bewohner" (inhabitants) is a mistranslation regarding its form; it does not incorporate the necessary preposition "mit" which would correctly align with "Bewohnern" in context.	- "Angst" (fear) is less precise than "Sorge" in this context, as "Sorge" better captures the nuance of concern about rising rents.	- "Vergneidung" appears to be a mistranslation of "gentrification," potentially a phonetic error, and does not convey the correct meaning compared to "Gentrifizierung."
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While the phrasing is slightly different from the reference translation, the candidate maintains the intended meaning without introducing significant errors. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as different expressions can be valid in translations if they retain the same overall meaning.
schisms → Schlüsse → Graben  	squatters → Quattern → Hausbesetzern  		**Explanation:** "Schlüsse" (conclusions) is a mistranslation of "schisms", which should be "Graben" (in this context, meaning rifts or divides). "Quattern" seems like a typographical error or an incorrect translation of "squatters", which should be "Hausbesetzern". Both errors significantly alter the intended meaning of the sentence, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence without significant mistranslations when compared to the reference translation. Both sentences convey the same information regarding the historical and current socioeconomic status of Friedrichshain, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
squatters → Quattern → Hausbesetzungen  	houses → Wohnviertel → Hausbesetzungen  	spawn → anbauen → geborenen  	Straßer → Straßer → Straße  		**Explanation:**  	- "Quattern" is not a correct translation for "squatters" and doesn't fit the context of the sentence. The appropriate translation in this context would be "Hausbesetzungen".	- "Wohnviertel" (residential districts/quarters) is an incorrect translation of "houses", which should be more accurately translated as "Hausbesetzungen" in this context where squatting is discussed.	- "anbauen" (build/cultivate) is a poor translation for "spawn", which in this context refers to "geborenen" (born/outcome of).	- "Straßer" is misspelled in the candidate sentence, where the correct German word should be "Straße". The reference also uses "Straße", indicating it is a typographical error rather than a different translation choice.
1. Mainzerstraße → ausgerottet → geräumt	2. gesessen → besetzt → besetzt		**Explanation:** "ausgerottet" (exterminated) is a mistranslation of "cleared out," which should be "geräumt." This changes the intended meaning regarding the eviction process. "gesessen" (sat) is a mistranslation of "squatted," which should be "besetzt" (occupied), significantly altering the historical context of the sentence.
residents → Bewohner → Wahlberliner  	squatters → Quästoren → Hausbesetzer  		**Explanation:** "Bewohner" (residents) in the candidate translation is a mistranslation of "Berlin residents" which is more accurately translated as "Wahlberliner," people from elsewhere living in Berlin. This is important as this phrase refers to a specific subgroup of residents. "Quästoren" (quaestors) is an incorrect translation of "squatters," which should be translated as "Hausbesetzer," referring to people who occupy buildings without lawful permission. Both errors significantly alter the contextual meaning, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the essential elements and meaning of the source sentence. Although there are some differences in wording compared to the reference translation, these do not constitute significant translation errors. The phrase and word choices in the candidate are acceptable and recognizable to convey the intended meaning.
development → Entwicklung → Entwicklung (Note: There is a discrepancy between the translations "angesehen" (viewed) and "angegriffen" (attacked) in relation to development, but it does not result in a single-word mistranslation that significantly alters the meaning of the sentence.)		from → aus → an (Note: The candidate translation uses "aus," suggesting a literal outward observation, as opposed to "an," which indicates recognition by)		broken → kaputten → eingeworfenen (The candidate translation uses "kaputten" (broken) instead of "eingeworfenen" (smashed), which is a more specific description of the damage.)		splattered → zersplittert → beworfen (The candidate word "zersplittert" (shattered) does not align with "beworfen" (thrown), altering the intended meaning of paint being thrown onto the facades, not shattering them like glass.)		No translation errors detected. (The remaining words in the translation are acceptable given the context and adhere to **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and prioritization of meaningful errors.)
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence and aligns with the reference translation. There are no significant single-word mistranslations present that alter the intended meaning.
not all → dies → nicht alle  	source: → wie → wie Körperverletzung  	almost all → fast alle Verbrechen → fast ausschließlich  		**Explanation:**  	- "dies" (this) is incorrectly used to translate "not all", which changes the meaning of the sentence from specifying "not all neighbours" to "this is not a problem for all".	- "wie" fits contextually, but the reference translation specifies "Körperverletzung" (bodily harm). Here, we focus on matching the explicit example in the reference.	- "fast alle Verbrechen" (almost all crimes) is misleading in context. The reference indicates "fast ausschließlich" (almost exclusively), highlighting a significant aspect of the sentence. The phrase is dissected down to the most significant words based on the instruction to concentrate on single-word errors.
majority → meisten → größten  	crimes → Verbrechen → Straftaten  	damage → Immobilienschäden → Sachbeschädigungen  		**Explanation:** 	- "meisten" (most) is a mistranslation of "majority", which in this context should be "größten".	- "Verbrechen" (crimes) is not the correct legal term here; the proper term should be "Straftaten".	- "Immobilienschäden" (damage to real estate) does not convey the intended meaning of "damage to property", which should be "Sachbeschädigungen".
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation captures the intended meaning of the source sentence accurately. "Block von Wohngebäuden" (block of flats) aligns with "Mietshaus", and there is no significant deviation impacting the context or meaning. "lebt" (lives) is an appropriate choice over "wohnt" in this context, and both "der" and "die" can grammatically refer to "Kerstin Neugebauer", aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, no single-word translation errors that significantly change the meaning are detected.
calm → besonnen → beschwichtigend  	acts of violence → Gewaltakten → Gewalttaten  	number → Alter → 94  	certainly → mit Sicherheit → bestimmt  
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the meaning of the source sentence and aligns closely with the reference translation. Key concepts like "notorious" (berüchtigt) and "burning cars" (brennenden Autos) are translated correctly, and the variations in sentence structure do not significantly alter the meaning. Hence, there are no significant single-word errors to report.
trained → ausgebildete → studierte  	flashpoint → Kriminalitätsflasch → Brennpunkt  		**Explanation:**  	- **trained → ausgebildete → studierte**: "ausgebildete" can mean trained, but "studierte" (educated or studied) implies a higher level of education or formal training specifically relating to "architect", making "studierte Architektin" contextually more appropriate.	- **flashpoint → Kriminalitätsflasch → Brennpunkt**: "Kriminalitätsflasch" is a mistranslation; "Flasch" is not a valid German word in this context. "Brennpunkt" is the correct term for a critical or problematic area, such as a "flashpoint" in terms of crime.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although the candidate translation uses different structures and word choices, the core meanings of "chose to move" and "chose to stay" are maintained. Both translations effectively convey the decision-making process described in the source sentence. The main focus here is on the meaningfulness and accuracy of the translation rather than a word-for-word comparison.
residents → Bürger → Anwohner
empty → leeren → ehemaligen  	impersonal → unmenschliche → gesichtslose  		**Explanation:** "leeren" (empty) is a mistranslation of "old", as the context refers to "former" or "previous" sites rather than emphasizing their emptiness. "unmenschliche" (inhuman) is a mistranslation of "impersonal", as it changes the nature of the developments being criticized. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
freehold → freie → Eigentums  	interested → interessieren → interessant  		**Explanation:** "freie" (free) is a mistranslation of "freehold". "Eigentums" (freehold) is the correct reference word, indicating ownership. The word "interessieren" (interest) is incorrectly used as it implies interest as a verb, while "interessant" (interesting) is the appropriate adjective form used in the reference, changing the structure and clarity of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Ich kann Gewalt und Zerstörung absolut nicht dulden" accurately communicates the meaning of the source sentence "I absolutely cannot condone violence and destruction." Both "dulden" (tolerate) and "gutheißen" (condone/approve) are semantically correct within this context, and the overall message remains unchanged. Thus, there are no significant single-word errors that alter the meaning of the sentence.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the source sentence and aligns well with the reference translation despite minor differences in style or expression. Both "sollen Sie tun" and "soll man denn machen" adequately convey the concept of "what should you do," and "wenn Ihnen niemand zuhört" matches the meaning of "when nobody listens to you." These variations are acceptable as they do not alter the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation aligns well with the source sentence in terms of meaning. Although there are some structural differences compared to the reference translation, the key elements such as "everyone" → "jeder", "frustrated" → "frustriert", "police" → "Polizei", and "residents" → "Einwohner" remain accurately translated. The variations do not significantly change the meaning, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
moved in → eingetroffen → Zugezogene  	housing project → Wohnungsbauvorhaben → Hausprojekte  	are → irritiert sind → ärgern  	district → Stadtteil → Kiez  		**Explanation:** 	- "eingetroffen" (arrived) is a mistranslation of "moved in". The correct term "Zugezogene" (newcomers) better matches the context.	- "Wohnungsbauvorhaben" (housing construction project) mistranslates "housing project". The term "Hausprojekte" (house projects) in the reference better fits the context of community or activist housing.	- "irritiert sind" (are irritated) is inaccurate for "ärgern" (annoyed by). This changes the nature of the reaction to paint bombs.	- "Stadtteil" (district) does not capture the informal or colloquial nature of "Kiez" (neighborhood), which is significant in the context of local culture.
aware → wissen → bewusst	moves → begibt → zieht	area → Gebiet → Kneipenviertel  		**Explanation:** "wissen" (know) is a mistranslation of "aware", which significantly changes the meaning. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "aware" is about being conscious, while "know" might imply a different type of awareness. "begibt" (goes) is a less accurate translation for "moves," and although it's not incorrect, it doesn't fit the explicit action of relocating implied by "zieht" (moves). "Gebiet" (area) is a general term, whereas "Kneipenviertel" (pub quarter) is more specific and fits the context better, thus violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it loses the specificity of the district.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the intended meaning of the source sentence accurately. Although there are differences in wording compared to the reference translation, these differences do not constitute significant errors and adhere to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Both versions accurately capture the concept of people wanting their real names not to be used.
Deutscle → Deutschel → Deuschle  	Commissioner → Flüchtlingskommissar → Flüchtlingsbeauftragte  		**Explanation:**  	- "Deutscle" is a mistranslation of "Deuschle" as it represents a misspelled name. This represents a clear error, according to the **Identify Mistranslations** rule, affecting the correct identification of the person.	- "Flüchtlingskommissar" translates to "Commissioner for Refugees," whereas the reference uses "Flüchtlingsbeauftragte" (a commissioned official to deal with refugee matters) which is more contextually accurate. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule since "Beauftragte" captures the intended role more meaningfully in terms of responsibility without being overly authoritative compared to "Kommissar."
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the meaning of the source sentence accurately. The differences between "Kontaktperson" and "Ansprechpartnerin," as well as "Organisation" and "Organisatorin," are in line with acceptable variations, and the main concepts are correctly captured. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the intended meaning accurately. The translation "vor Ort als Sozialarbeiter arbeiten" captures the essence of "work on-site as a social worker." Both translations represent the source sentence's meaning adequately, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Deuschle → Duchele → Deuschle		**Explanation:** "Duchele" appears to be a typo or mistranslation of "Deuschle," and proper names typically need to be translated accurately to maintain the correct reference. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as the name is critical for identifying the person.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate and reference translations both capture the core elements of the source sentence. Terms like "Sozialarbeiter" (social worker) for "Socialpädagogin" (social education worker) and "Führungsteam" (management team) for "Team der Verwaltung" are acceptable variations, as they do not significantly alter the meaning or context of the original sentence and fit the intended meaning in context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, when compared to the reference translation. Both "Kontaktstelle" (point-of-contact) and "Ansprechpartnerin" (contact person) appropriately fit in context, and the other elements match closely with the intended meaning in the reference.
Regine → Reine → Regine  	volunteers → Freiwilligen → Ehrenamtlichen  	jack-of-all-trades → Jackwerk → eierlegende Wollmilchsau  
1. advert → Auftrag → Stelle  	2. management → das Management → die Verwaltung  		**Explanation:**  	- "Auftrag" (assignment/order) is a mistranslation of "advert", significantly altering the meaning since the context is about a job listing. The correct reference should be "Stelle" (job position).	- "das Management" (the management) is overly specific and does not match the intended meaning of "Verwaltung" (administration/management), which is more suitable in this context.
people skills → Fachkenntnissen → Talent für Sprachen und Menschen	jack-of-all-trades → Allhandelsjack → eierlegende Wollmilchsau		**Explanation:** "Fachkenntnissen" (specialized knowledge) is not the correct translation for "people skills", which involves interpersonal interaction and communication. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. Additionally, "Allhandelsjack" is a literal mistranslation of "jack-of-all-trades" and doesn't carry the same idiomatic meaning as "eierlegende Wollmilchsau" in German, which means a person with a wide range of skills. This follows the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule, isolating "Allhandelsjack" as the key error.
However → Managementarbeit → Doch  	managerial → Verwaltungsarbeit → zentraler  	spends → verbringt → Bereich  	says → sagt → meint  	Deuschle → Duschle → Deuschle  		**Explanation:**  	1. "However" (Doch) is mistranslated as "Managementarbeit". The correct translation in this context is "Doch", following the **Identify Mistranslations** rule.	2. "managerial" (zentraler) is translated as "Verwaltungsarbeit". "Verwaltungsarbeit" (administrative work) is not a direct synonym for "managerial" in this context, making "zentraler Bereich" (central area) a more precise counterpart, addressing the **Focus on Single-Word Errors**.	3. "spends" is not the focus of the German sentence in the same way, "verbringt" is a mistranslation of "Bereich". The key error lies in the conceptual mismatch where time is mentioned instead of function or focus, in alignment with the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy**.	4. "says" (meint) is translated as "sagt." Although they are similar, "meint" is a better fit because the original context implies opinion or assertion, not just stating, as per **Prioritize Meaningful Errors**.	5. "Deuschle" is misspelled as "Duschle" in the candidate translation which alters the identity, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected. 		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively captures the meaning of the source sentence. Words such as "Organisation", "Arbeit vor Ort mit Menschen", "Hintergrund", and "Vernetzung" are translated faithfully compared to the reference translation. Although there are differences such as "im Hintergrund" versus "hinter den Kulissen", these do not significantly change the meaning or context. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where different valid expressions convey the intended meaning accurately.
31-year-old → 31-Jahre → 31-Jährige  	has been → sind → ist  	post → Posten → dabei  		**Explanation:** "31-Jahre" translates to "31 years" instead of "31-year-old," altering the subject to 'years' instead of referring to the person's age, breaching the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "sind" (are) is a mistranslation of "has been," which should be "ist" (is), violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule. Finally, "Posten" (post) is a mistranslation here and should be "dabei" (in position), which fits the context better according to the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
50% → 50% → 50-Prozent  	job → Arbeit → Stelle  	fixed term → festgelegte Amtszeit → befristet  		**Explanation:** 	1. "50%" is translated as "50%," which directly matches the source but the reference translation provides "50-Prozent" for clarity, aligning with standard German usage in this context.	2. "job" is mistranslated as "Arbeit" (work) instead of "Stelle" (position), which is specifically intended in the context of employment.	3. The phrase "fixed term" is rendered as "festgelegte Amtszeit," which implies a defined term in an official capacity rather than a limited duration specific to employment, hence "befristet" is more accurate.
Annika → Duschle → Deuschle  	voluntary → Freiwillige → ehrenamtliche  	full-time → Vollzeitbeschäftigte → hauptamtliche  		**Explanation:** "Duschle" is a misspelling of "Deuschle", which is not significant in terms of meaning but incorrect spelling. "Freiwillige" refers to "volunteers" which is closely related but does not precisely convey "voluntary workers" in context, marked as "ehrenamtliche" in the reference. "Vollzeitbeschäftigte" (full-time employees) differs from "full-time workers" in context, with "hauptamtliche" being the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** All candidate translations correspond to valid translations of the source segments and maintain the original meaning. "große" for "major," "kleinere" for "minor," "organisatorische" for "organizational," "Probleme mit Menschen" for "problems with people," and "Verständnisprobleme" for "comprehension problems" are all correct within the context, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules. The structure of the sentence varies, but the candidate translation does not contain individual word errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** 	- "New containers" is correctly translated to "neue Container" in both candidate and reference.	- "Will soon be located" translates to "werden in Kürze angesiedelt sein" (candidate) and "Bald stehen ... in" (reference). Both versions convey the future placement of containers soon, differing slightly in verb choice but maintaining the same overall meaning.	- "In Wasenstraße" is consistent between the candidate and reference translations. 	Overall, there are no significant errors that change the meaning, aligning with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
1. major → großes → schwerwiegendes  	2. homes → Zuhause → Wohnungen  	3. certified → bescheinigt → anerkannt  		**Explanation:** "großes" (big) is a mistranslation of "major", which should have been rendered as "schwerwiegendes" (serious) to convey the significant nature of the problem. "Zuhause" (home) is a mistranslation of "homes", which should be "Wohnungen" (apartments/housing) in this context to correctly refer to the type of accommodation needed for refugees. "bescheinigt" (certified) is a mistranslation of "anerkannt" (recognized), which is a more accurate descriptor for the status granted to refugees. These errors change the meaning or reduce the accuracy of the intended message.
(Communes → Gemeinschaften → Kommunen)  	(subsequent → spätere → Anschluss-)  		**Explanation:** "Gemeinschaften" (communities) is a mistranslation of "Communes", which in this context refers to a specific administrative unit typically better translated as "Kommunen". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Gemeinschaften" conveys a broader, less specific meaning. "spätere" (later) is a mistranslation of "subsequent" in this context, where "Anschlussunterbringung" captures the intended idea of follow-up or subsequent accommodation, adhering to the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
properties → Mieteigentum → angemieteten Wohnräumen  		**Explanation:** "Mieteigentum" (rented property) does not match the intended phrase "in rented properties," which corresponds to "in angemieteten Wohnräumen" in the reference. "Wohnräumen" refers to living spaces, which aligns with "properties" in the context of housing refugees. The mistranslation significantly alters the intended meaning concerning where the refugees might be housed, which is a critical aspect of the instructions under the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Gemeinschaften" for "communes," which is a valid term referring to communities, potentially including communes. The rest of the translation accurately reflects the source sentence. Therefore, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules, no single-word errors significantly affecting meaning have been found.
Responsibility → Verantwortung → Verantwortung  	district administration → Stadtverwaltung → Landratsamt  	switches → erstreckt → wechselt  	communes → Gemeinden → Kommune  	job centres → Arbeitszentren → Jobcenter  		**Explanation:** Here are the points of error based on the instructions:		1. **district administration → Stadtverwaltung → Landratsamt:** "Stadtverwaltung" (city administration) is a mistranslation of "district administration". It changes the meaning because the scope of administration (district vs. city) is different.	  	2. **switches → erstreckt → wechselt:** "Erstreckt sich" means "extends" rather than "switches", which refers to a change in responsibility. This is a significant change in meaning.		3. **communes → Gemeinden → Kommune:** Though "Gemeinden" (municipalities) might seem close to "Kommune", the reference specifies "Kommune", indicating a specific type of administrative division. This reflects an error in the specific intended meaning.		4. **job centres → Arbeitszentren → Jobcenter:** "Arbeitszentren" means "work centers", which could be interpreted differently from "Jobcenter", particularly in the context of German administrative language where "Jobcenter" has a specific connotation related to employment services.
properties → Eigentum → Objekte  	landlord → Land → Vermieter  		**Explanation:** "Eigentum" (property/ownership) is a mistranslation of "Properties," which in this context refers to "Objekte" (real estate units/properties available for rent). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Eigentum" does not convey the intended meaning of rentable properties. Additionally, "Land" (land/country) is a mistranslation of "landlord," substantially altering the meaning of the sentence. This is a clear error under the **Identify Mistranslations** rule as it confuses the subject entirely.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "war" instead of "gestaltet sich", but both convey the idea that the search has been difficult for a period. Similarly, "seit einiger Zeit" is an accurate translation for "for a while", and "sehr schwierig" matches the meaning of "very difficult". There are no significant changes in meaning.
homes → Häuser → Wohnungen  		**Explanation:** "Häuser" (houses) is a mistranslation of "homes", which should be "Wohnungen" (apartments) in the context of finding private residences, following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule for maintaining the intended meaning in the reference translation.
**No translation errors detected.**  		**Explanation:** Although there are differences between the candidate and the reference translation, the translation of individual words maintains the intended meaning from the source sentence. "Deuschle" is correctly translated as "Deutschler", "reliant on private homes" is accurately conveyed with "auf Privathaushalte angewiesen", and "has not worked" matches "hat es nicht funktioniert". The differences are stylistic rather than incorrect based on meaningful errors as per the provided instructions.
homes → Häuser → Wohnungen  	beefed up → vernichtet → ertüchtigt  		**Explanation:** The word "Häuser" (houses) in the candidate translation does not closely match "homes" in context, where "Wohnungen" (apartments or homes) is more appropriate, following the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. "vernichtet" (destroyed) is an incorrect translation for "beefed up" (strengthened or improved), significantly altering the sentence's meaning, which violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** Each word in the candidate sentence conveys the intended meaning aligned with the source and reference sentences, and there are neither significant mistranslations nor contextual inaccuracies.
homes → Haushalte → Wohnungen  		**Explanation:** "Haushalte" (households) is a mistranslation of "homes", which in this context refers to physical buildings, not the people living in them. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the intended meaning pertains to buildings, not households.
Perspective → Voraussicht → Perspektive  	Deuschle → Duschle → Deuschle  		**Explanation:** "Voraussicht" (foresight) is a mistranslation of "perspective", which changes the intended concept entirely, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule. The name "Deuschle" is incorrectly translated as "Duschle", which must be preserved accurately, despite minor typographical variations, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule regarding names.
1. abode → Aufenthalt → Bleibe	2. internships → Praktikanten → Praktikumsplätze	3. apprenticeships → Lehrstellen → Ausbildungsstellen	4. traineeship → Praktikumsstellen → Ein-Euro-Jobs	5. temporary jobs → Zeitarbeitsstellen → Aushilfstätigkeiten		**Explanation:**  	- "Aufenthalt" (residency/stay) is a mistranslation of "abode", which should convey a sense of a physical dwelling like "Bleibe".	- "Praktikanten" (interns) is a mistranslation of "internships", which should refer to positions or places like "Praktikumsplätze".	- "Lehrstellen" (training positions) does not strongly capture the formal apprentice role intended by "apprenticeships", where "Ausbildungsstellen" is more appropriate.	- "Praktikumsstellen" (internship posts) is an acceptable interpretation but not the specific "Ein-Euro-Jobs" intended, which refers to a specific type of job scheme.	- "Zeitarbeitsstellen" (temporary work positions) doesn't adequately capture the potentially more casual or temporary nature hinted by "Aushilfstätigkeiten" (auxiliary activities), which would more accurately convey "temporary jobs" in the context.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately reflects the source sentence, particularly in translating "jobs" as "Arbeitsplätze." Although the reference translation uses "Plätze," both translations convey similar meanings in this context by emphasizing an increase in opportunities. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule by recognizing both translations as acceptable without significant meaning change.
1. builder's yards → Bauernhof → Bauhof	2. caretakers → Betreuern → Hausmeistern	3. voluntary work → freiwillige Arbeit → gemeinnützige Arbeit	4. orderly → geordnete → ordentlich		**Explanation:**  	- "Bauernhof" (farm) is a mistranslation of "builder's yards", which should be "Bauhof", meaning a construction yard or workshop.	- "Betreuern" (caretakers, more general) is a mistranslation of "caretakers" in the context meant here, which should be "Hausmeistern" (janitors or caretakers in a building maintenance sense).	- "freiwillige Arbeit" (voluntary work) and "gemeinnützige Arbeit" (communal or charitable work) can be quite different, especially in the legal or formal context, although they often overlap in casual understanding.	- "geordnete" (ordered) does not fit the context of motivation being provided, where "ordentlich" (orderly) implies efficient or well-structured motivation, properly aligning with the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence, even though "Gemeinschaft" (community) and "Gemeinwesen" (commonwealth/community) or "öffentlichen Wahrnehmung" (public perception) and "Außenwirkung" (external effect) are slightly different. These differences do not significantly alter the overall meaning, thus following the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the source sentence's meaning. While there is a difference in terms of the tenses and introduction using "sei", the core phrase "keine Beschäftigungstherapie" remains consistent between the candidate and reference translation. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as these subtle changes do not significantly alter the meaning of the sentence.
being → Aktives → Tätigkeit  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Aktives" (active) in the sense of "being active," whereas the source and reference emphasize the broader concept of "Tätigkeit" (activity or being active in the general sense), which seems to capture the intended meaning more accurately in context. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as "Aktives Handeln" (active action) is less precise in conveying "being active" in the context provided.
Deuschle → Deuchle → Deuschle  		**Explanation:** "Deuchle" appears to be a misspelling of "Deuschle". This significantly changes the proper name, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate word "müssen" (need to) and the reference word "müssten" (should ideally) are close in meaning in this context. Although they reflect a slight modal difference, the core intent of developing a sense of belonging is maintained, and it doesn't significantly change the meaning of the sentence. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Folglich" for "Consequently," "notwendig" for "a need," and "Kontakte zu den Einheimischen" for "contact to locals," all of which fit the intended meaning and context. Both "bereitstellen" and "angebote wie" effectively convey the same message as the source sentence. Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, the differences do not constitute errors, as the overall meaning is preserved.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "Berufskurse" and "Professionelle Kurse" can translate to "Professional courses" in different contexts. Similarly, "selten" and "rar" are near-synonyms meaning "rare". Therefore, the candidate sentence maintains the intended meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
engaged → engagieren → ein		**Explanation:** "engagieren" is a mistranslation in this context from the source "can get involved", where the reference uses "einspringen", a German word implying actively stepping in, which is closer to the intended meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately captures the essential meaning of the source sentence, and the words used like "wichtig" (important/key), "gewollt" (wanted), and "willkommen" (welcome) conform to contextual expectation in German. The candidate's slight wording variations, such as using "wichtig" instead of "zentral" for "key", maintain the intended message consistent with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Therefore, there are no significant single-word translation errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** "Dauer" (duration/length), "Prozesse" (processes), and "Problem" (problem) are appropriate and contextually fitting translations of the corresponding source words. The candidate translation captures the essential meaning of the source sentence despite slight differences in phrasing and structure.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Upon inspection, the candidate translation closely matches the source and reference sentences in meaning, structure, and intent. The differences between "dass es so lange dauern wird" and "dass es eben dauert", as well as "die Zeit produktiv gefüllt werden kann" and "sie die Zeit sinnvoll überbrücken können", do not represent significant changes in meaning that would warrant identifying single-word mistranslations. These variations are acceptable and fall under natural translation variability.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. While there are some differences between the candidate and reference translations, they both maintain the overall meaning and intent of the source. The differences are stylistic and don't reflect significant meaning errors, in line with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Die klare Mehrheit ist motiviert" maintains the essential meaning of the source sentence. While there is a variation in the translation of "clear" ("klare" vs. "deutliche") and the verb tense/mood ("ist" vs. "sei"), both are acceptable variations that do not significantly change the meaning. This follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, and no error is reported.
Kunde → Duschle → Deuschle  		**Explanation:** "Duschle" in the candidate translation is a mistranslation of "Deuschle" from the reference translation. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as it changes the name of a person. The rest of the sentence retains its meaning, aligning it within the acceptable variations specified.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with the reference translation. "Mammutaufgabe" is correctly translated, and while the phrasing differs slightly ("Alles gesagt" vs. "Das alles sei schon"), the meaning is maintained, complying with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. Additionally, quotation marks are preserved around "Mammutaufgabe", making the translation faithful to the source.
tricky → heikle → schwierige  	events → Ereignissen → Vorkommnissen  	worried → besorgt → Angst  		**Explanation:**  	- "heikle" (delicate) is a mistranslation of "tricky". "schwierige" (difficult) is the more accurate translation reflecting the intended meaning of the question being challenging.	- "Ereignissen" (events) conveys a broader meaning than "Vorkommnissen" (incidents), which in this context fits better since it emphasizes on specific events that provoke concern.	- "besorgt" (concerned or worried) does not fully capture "Angst" (fear), which indicates a stronger sense of worry in the context of potential radicalisation.
1. said → sagte → sagt	2. clearly → klar → ganz deutlich	3. people → manche → mancher	4. remaining → zu bestehen → ausschließen		**Explanation:**  	1. "sagte" is a past tense translation of "said", but the reference uses "sagt" for present tense according to the context given by the reference. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.	2. "klar" does not capture the same level of emphasis as "ganz deutlich" (very clearly). This changes the intensity of the statement, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.	3. "manche" is a non-specific plural, while "mancher" as used in the reference is singular and specific in its context. The error misrepresents the statement from the singular "some might" to the plural form against the reference intent, violating the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.	4. "zu bestehen" (to exist) is incorrect in the context, as the reference uses "ausschließen" (exclude), which directly fits the context of denying the possibility of risk, adhering to the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and reference translation both convey the same meaning with acceptable variations. "Freiwilligen" (volunteers) corresponds to "Helfer" (helpers), "sind sich dessen bewusst" (are aware of this) aligns with "sensibilisiert" (made aware), and "jedoch bereits" (already however) is equivalent to "aber schon" (but already). Despite some structural differences, the meaning is preserved, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Fragen" (questions/issues) for "issues" and "diskutiert" (discussed) for "discussed", which are valid in this context according to the source sentence. The reference sentence's translation is broader and more interpretative but does not explicitly point out any mistranslation in the candidate version, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. The focus here should remain on identifiable word-level errors where the candidate clearly deviates in a manner that is demonstrably incorrect, which is not the case.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "befürchteten" and "hatten die Angst" are valid translations for "were afraid" as they convey the same concern in context. "völlig" and "komplett" are also acceptable variations for "total" in this context. The key term "attackers" is correctly translated as "Attentäter". Therefore, no significant mistranslation affecting the meaning of the sentence is identified.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation and the reference translation are almost identical, with only a tense change from "sagte" (said) to "sagt" (says) for "said". Both convey the same meaning in this context, which follows the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, so no error is reported.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Viele von ihnen möchten gern in Urbach bleiben." captures the intended meaning of the source sentence "Many of them would like to stay in Urbach." The use of "möchten gern" is an acceptable variation of "würden gerne" and maintains the intended meaning without introducing any significant changes. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, where similar expressions that do not affect the overall meaning are not marked as errors.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation successfully conveys the meaning of the source sentence. Words like "full-time" and "volunteer" are appropriately translated as "Vollzeitbeschäftigte" and "Freiwillige," respectively. "Keep an eye open for jobs in the town and across the region" is also captured well in context. The phrases are paraphrased, but the essential meaning remains intact, complying with the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "scheuen sich davor, diese Frage zu beantworten" (candidate) and "scheut sich die Politik, diese Frage klar zu beantworten" (reference) convey the idea that politicians are hesitant or avoid answering the question. The meanings align well enough that there are no significant changes in meaning, and thus no single-word translation errors are present. This adheres to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule, as the difference in structure does not impact the core meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation maintains the meaning of the source sentence. "Freiwillige" is a valid translation for "volunteers" and "vor Ort" appropriately translates "on site." Even though the structure differs, the candidate sentence conveys the intended meaning, adhering to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
Deuschle → Duschle → Deuschle  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation contains a misspelling of the proper noun "Deuschle" as "Duschle". This is a clear violation of the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as it misidentifies a person. Proper names should remain consistent across translations.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation effectively communicates the meaning and intent of the source sentence, using acceptable German phrasing. Both the candidate and reference translations reflect the core idea, so no significant single-word translation errors are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:**  	- "mächt auch deutlich" in the candidate translation corresponds well to "makes clear".	- "die Bewohner von Urbach" and "die Urbacher" both refer to the residents of Urbach.	- "die bis heute eingetroffenen Flüchtlinge" aligns with "die bisherigen Menschen" in context, as both refer to the refugees who have arrived to date.	- "voll integrieren können" is a reasonable translation of the intent to integrate fully, similar to "vernünftig zu integrieren".	- While there are differences in the expression, none of them result in a significant change in meaning or violate the provided rules. Hence, no single-word mistranslation errors are detected.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation accurately conveys the meaning of the source sentence. The variations between "Derzeit" and "zurzeit", "etwa" and "rund", and "Menschen" and "Personen" are acceptable and do not significantly alter the sentence's meaning. As per the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rules, these differences are not considered mistranslations.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "müssen Sie" (you must) instead of "müsse man" (one must), but the meaning remains the same in context. "stimmen dem zu" (agree to it) and "sind sich einig" (are in agreement) both convey the agreement in the sentence. Therefore, no single-word translation errors significantly change the meaning, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation closely aligns with the reference translation. The differences, such as "Situation" vs. "Weltlage" and "dass es dort keine" vs. "da gibt es keine," do not significantly alter the meaning or context of the source sentence. Therefore, there are no meaningful single-word mistranslations to report.
search → Suche → gesucht  	intruders → Eindringlingen → Einbrecher  		**Explanation:** "Suche" (search) is a mistranslation of "searched", where "gesucht" is more appropriate in passive construction. "Eindringlingen" means "intruders" generally, whereas "Einbrecher" (burglars) fits the context of a search conducted for breaking and entering incidents.
No translation errors detected.  		**Explanation:** All words in the candidate translation correspond well to the source sentence and do not significantly change the intended meaning. The main actions and descriptions are correctly retained.
apartment → Apartement → Wohnung  		**Explanation:** The word "Apartement" is a mistranslation of "apartment" in this context as it refers to a specific type of accommodation within a larger building, which in German is more accurately described as "Wohnung". This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "Apartement" deviates from the intended meaning of a residential unit within an apartment building.
men → Flüchtlinge → Männer		**Explanation:** "Flüchtlinge" (refugees) is a mistranslation of "men" (Männer) and significantly alters the identity of the individuals in question, violating the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule.
1. men → Männer → Männer	2. between → zwischen → etwa	3. m → Millionen → Meter	4. tall → Maß → groß	5. masks → Masken → maskiert	6. tops → Hotpots → Kapuzenpullis		**Explanation:**		- "zwischen" is conceptually correct but misleads because it implies a physical object between a range rather than height. "etwa" (around/about) is a better fit here.	- "1,70 Millionen" (1.70 million) is a significant error for "1,70m" (1.70 meters). "Millionen" is incorrect; it needs to be "Meter."	- "Maß" (measure) is not appropriate for "tall"; "gross" (tall) aligns correctly with the reference.	- "Masken" refers incorrectly to "masks," while "maskiert" (masked) is a description fitting the reference.	- "Hotpots" (incorrect translation, possibly a transliteration error) is not correct for "black hooded tops," which should be "Kapuzenpullis" (hoodies/sweatshirts).
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Sie gingen in das Zentrum der Stadt" translates to "They went to the center of town," which is contextually close to the source sentence. The source sentence's "heading towards" is adequately captured, and "centre of town" correlates with "Zentrum der Stadt". While the reference translation uses a different structure and verbs, this is an acceptable variation and not a single-word translation error.
strip → streifende → Streifenbesatzungen  		**Explanation:** "streifende" (roaming) is a mistranslation of "strip", which in this context refers to "Streifenbesatzungen" (strip patrols). This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule because "streifende Patrouillen" does not communicate the intended meaning of the specialized patrol unit referred to by "strip patrols". All other words adequately translate the source sentence without significantly altering meaning.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Ohne Erfolg" correctly translates "Without success". Though the reference translation includes additional context that specifies "Die Fahndung verlief" (The search was), the candidate translation of the key phrase "Without success" is accurate. The meaning is preserved, so there are no single-word errors. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
unknown assailants → unbekannten Angreifer → Unbekannten  	escape → Flugs → Flucht  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation uses "Angreifer" (attackers) whereas the reference uses "Unbekannten" (unknowns), which, although similar, changes the specificity slightly, qualifying for a notable individual error. Additionally, "Flugs" (flight) is a mistranslation of "escape" and should be "Flucht" based on the reference "Flucht".
bikers → Fahrern → Rocker  	snack bar → Snack-Bar → Imbiss  		**Explanation:**  	- "Fahrern" (drivers) is a mistranslation of "bikers" (often associated with motorcyclists), which should be "Rocker" in this context, referring to a specific cultural group.	- "Snack-Bar" does not capture the local term "Imbiss," which is more accurate in German-speaking regions. This violates the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule as "Imbiss" is the more commonly understood term for a casual food outlet.
attack → Angriff → Attacke  	snack stand → Peitsche → Imbiss  	biker → bikeren → Rocker  	associate → anschließen → aus  	peace → Frieden → Landfrieden  		**Explanation:**  	- "Angriff" is a valid translation for "attack," but "Attacke" is more precise in this context.	- "Peitsche" means "whip" and is not a correct translation for "snack stand." "Imbiss" is the proper term.	- "bikeren Gemeinschaft" (biker community) is a literal translation but less idiomatic than "Rockermilieu" (biker milieu or community).	- "anschließen" (associate) here does not properly capture the meaning of "aus," which indicates the suspects are already part of the biker community.	- "Frieden" (peace) should be "Landfrieden" for "breach of the peace," which is a legal term.
house → Parlament → Wohnungs  	searches → Nachforschungen → Durchsuchungen  	revealed → enthüllt → sichergestellt  	evidence → Beweise → Beweismittel  
masked → versteckte → maskierte  	biker-esque → Bikeresker → rockerähnlichen  	snack bar → Schneebar → Imbisses  		**Explanation:**  	1. "versteckte" (hidden) is a mistranslation of "masked", altering the meaning from being intentionally concealed with masks to simply being hidden, which is an important contextual difference.	2. "Bikeresker" is a less common and somewhat awkward attempt to translate "biker-esque", which is more accurately and contextually rendered as "rockerähnlichen" (biker-like or rocker-like).	3. "Schneebar" (snow bar) is an incorrect translation of "snack bar", which should be "Imbisses" in this context to accurately capture the type of establishment mentioned.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Although there are differences between the candidate and reference translations, the candidate sentence accurately translates the source sentence without changing the intended meaning. The words "Kunden" (customers) and "verletzt" (injured) in the candidate sentence fit the context appropriately, aligning with the source sentence. Therefore, no essential single-word mistranslations are present.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Dann flohen sie" and the reference translation "Danach flohen sie" both convey the same meaning as the source sentence "Then they fled." The words "Dann" and "Danach" are interchangeable in this context and do not significantly alter the sentence's meaning. Therefore, no significant translation error is present according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule and **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
amounting → angerichtet → entstand  		**Explanation:** The translation of "amounting" should convey that the damage totaled 10,000 euros. The candidate uses "angerichtet" (caused), which does not accurately capture the idea of the damage totaling or summing to this amount as "entstand" (arose) does in the reference. This follows the **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rule, as the contextual meaning differs.
Ulm's → großen → Ulmer  	biker → Banden → Rockermilieu  		**Explanation:** "großen" (large) is a mistranslation of "Ulm's", which significantly changes the meaning of the sentence by introducing size instead of specifying location. "Banden" (gangs/bands) is a mistranslation for "biker" in this context, as it lacks the connotation of "biker gang" reflected in "Rockermilieu" (biker milieu), focusing on the distinctive subculture and context. These errors violate the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** and **Ensure Contextual Accuracy** rules.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation "Thüringen: Zeiss Meditec nähert sich einem Umsatz von einer Milliarde" is a valid interpretation of "Thüringen: Zeiss Meditec comes closer to reaching a billion in turnover." Although the structure differs from the reference translation, the meaning remains consistent, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. No single-word errors significantly altering the meaning were identified.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** Both "starke" and "hohe" are appropriate translations for "strong" in this context, capturing the high level of demand. The candidate translation retains the intended meaning without introducing any mistranslations. Therefore, according to the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule and the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule, there are no significant translation errors to report.
percent → % → Prozent		**Explanation:** The candidate uses the "%" symbol instead of the word "Prozent," which is used in the reference. This follows the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule as it pertains to the format and clarity of the text.
business → Geschäfte → Asiengeschäft  		**Explanation:** "Geschäfte" (businesses) is a mistranslation of "business" in this context. The reference uses "Asiengeschäft" to indicate a specific or singular "business in Asia," which aligns with the context better and avoids the potentially misleading plural interpretation. This violates the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule due to the significant difference in scope and focus between singular and plural meanings.
No translation errors detected.		**Explanation:** The candidate translation conveys the same meaning as the reference translation and the source sentence. Although phrases like "stiegen die Gewinne" and "erhöhte sich" (increased) differ, they are both correct in the context, following the **Handle Ambiguity Carefully** rule. No single-word translation errors have been identified, ensuring compliance with the **Focus on Single-Word Errors** guideline.
Jena-based → in Dschena ansässige → Jenaer  	medical technology → medizinische → Medizintechnik  	Board of Directors → Verwaltungsrat → Vorstand  		**Explanation:** The candidate translation contains several single-word errors that are significant in context:	1. "in Dschena ansässige" (based in Jena) is more verbosely translated compared to "Jenaer" (Jena-based), so the word "Dschena" is considered a mistranslation of "Jena-based."	2. "medizinische" (medical) fails to capture "medical technology," where "Medizintechnik" (medical technology) is more precise.	3. "Verwaltungsrat" (Administrative Council) is a mistranslation of "Board of Directors," where "Vorstand" is more suitable in corporate context.
Zeiss → Zeis → Zeiss  	practices → Ärzte → Arztpraxen  		**Explanation:** "Zeis" is a mistranslation of "Zeiss", which is a brand name and must be spelled correctly. "Ärzte" (doctors) is used instead of "Arztpraxen" (doctors' practices), which changes the specific context from practices to doctors themselves, violating the **Prioritize Meaningful Errors** rule.
owned → gehört → gehört  	optics → ­ → Optik  	people → Menschen → Mitarbeiter  		**Explanation:**  	1. "gehört" in the candidate translates "owned" correctly, so there is no error here.	2. The translation does not directly include a word for "optics" which appears in the source. In the reference, "Optik" specifically denotes the optics aspect of the company, so its absence is a meaningful omission considering the structured context of "optics and electronics firm".	3. "Mensen" is used to translate "people", which is typically acceptable, but in a workforce context, "Mitarbeiter" (employees) is more appropriate. This involves a contextual mismatch that is significant enough to note as an error since it alters the understanding of the group's composition in a business setting.
